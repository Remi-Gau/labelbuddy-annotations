The aim of this study was to examine underlying differences in brain structure from a network perspective. Baseline data were obtained from Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) participants. We divided PD patients and healthy controls (HC) into RBD positive and RBD negative using a cutoff score of \u22655 on the RBD screening questionnaire. HC with probable RBD were excluded. We first carried out a region-of-interest analysis of structural MRIs using voxel-based morphometry to study volumetric differences for the putamen, thalamus and hippocampus in a cross-sectional design. Additionally, an exploratory whole-brain analysis was performed. To study group differences from a network perspective, we then performed a \u2018seed-based\u2019 analysis of structural covariance, using the bilateral dorsal-caudal putamen, mediodorsal thalamus and anterior hippocampus as seed regions. The volume of the right putamen was smaller in PD patients with RBD. RBD symptom severity correlated negatively with volume of the right putamen, left hippocampus and left thalamus. We did not find any differences in structural covariance between PD patients with and without RBD. Presence of RBD and severity of RBD symptoms in PD are associated with smaller volumes of the putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by vivid dreaming in combination with a loss of physiological muscle atonia, resulting in complex movements during REM sleep (Olson et al.  ). Physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep is regulated by so-called \u2018REM on\u2019 and \u2018REM off\u2019 regions in the brainstem (Boeve  ; Boeve et al.  ). Dysfunction of these regions is thought to play a role in RBD pathophysiology (Boeve  ; Boeve et al.  ). \n\nRBD is an early symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and related disorders (Tekriwal et al.  ), but not all PD patients display RBD. A recent meta-analysis showed a prevalence of 42.3% (Zhang et al.  ). RBD in PD is associated with worse motor function and worse non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, olfactory dysfunction, excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment and a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression, impulse control disorders and hallucinations (Arnaldi et al.  ; Hu et al.  ; Kim et al.  ; Mahajan et al.  ; Pacchetti et al.  ; Rolinski et al.  ). \n\nBecause of the differences in clinical profile between PD patients with RBD (PD RBD+) and without RBD (PD RBD-), several neuroimaging studies have explored potential underlying neurobiological differences. Idiopathic RBD (iRBD) is associated with smaller putamen volume (Ellmore et al.  ,  ). A voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study showed smaller thalamic volume in PD RBD+ (Salsone et al.  ). A recent whole-brain deformation-based morphometry (DBM) study confirmed smaller putamen and thalamic volumes in PD RBD+, and additionally found a smaller volume of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT), medullary reticular formation (MRF), hypothalamus, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in PD RBD+ (Boucetta et al.  ). Smaller hippocampal volume in PD RBD+ was reported in another VBM study (Lim et al.  ). \n\nThese preliminary findings suggest that RBD in PD is associated with both (volumetric) alterations in the brainstem and subcortical and cortical degeneration. Boucetta et al. postulated that the observed structural differences not only reflect altered regulation of sleep-wake states and altered motor activity during REM sleep, but also play a role in the worse motor function and higher risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with RBD (Boucetta et al.  ). \n\nThe abovementioned studies found volumetric differences in isolated brain structures. However, the neurodegenerative process in PD may affect groups of interconnected brain areas (i.e., network-based neurodegeneration) rather than isolated brain areas independently, due to spreading of disease pathology to neighboring brain areas (Agosta et al.  ). To test this assumption, the aim of this study was to further clarify neuroanatomical differences between PD patients with and without RBD in two ways; first, by studying volumetric differences in isolated brain structures, and second, by studying differences in connectivity from a brain network perspective. The secondary aim was to compare volumetric and connectivity parameters between the two patient groups and healthy controls (HC). \n\nBased on the abovementioned literature we hypothesized that RBD in PD would be associated with degeneration of the putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. Therefore, we first carried out region-of-interest (ROI) analyses of these structures using VBM. Additionally, we performed an exploratory whole-brain VBM analysis to ensure we did not overlook significant group differences in regional volume. \n\nTo study group differences from a network perspective we used the relatively new technique of structural covariance (SC). SC can be used to study positive or negative covariance of gray-matter volume of one brain region with gray-matter volume of another brain region. Consistent patterns of covariance (when found across individuals) are considered to be indicative of connectivity between these brain regions. This is based on the theory that interconnected brain regions within a network not only show simultaneous brain activity, but also show correlations in gray-matter volume, perhaps due to joint neuroplastic or neurodegenerative processes (Mechelli et al.  ). In line with this theory, structural covariance networks partially overlap with functional brain networks (He et al.  ), and seed-based SC analyses of striatal and amygdalar sub-regions yield networks that are similar to functional networks (Montembeault et al.  ; Soriano-Mas et al.  ; Subira et al.  ). Our aim was to determine whether there is a difference in SC between PD RBD+ and PD RBD-. \n\nWithin the abovementioned ROI\u2019s (i.e., the bilateral thalamus, putamen and hippocampus) we selected smaller \u2018seed regions\u2019 involved in well-described functional networks that are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of PD (i.e., limbic system, associative cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC)-circuit, and motor CSTC-circuit) (Nigro et al.  ; Vriend et al.  ). We hypothesized that PD RBD+ would show altered SC between each of the selected seeds regions and connected brain areas, suggesting altered connectivity. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe made use of the open-access Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, a multicenter cohort study aimed at identifying biomarkers of PD progression. The aims and methodology of this study are published elsewhere (Marek et al.  ) and are available at  . The participants included in the PPMI database are de novo and treatment-na\u00efve PD patients and age- and sex-matched HC. We only included data from the baseline visit. As polysomnography - the gold standard for RBD diagnosis - is not part of the PPMI study protocol, we divided PD subjects and HC into RBD+ and RBD- using the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ). The RBDSQ is highly sensitive and reasonably specific for RBD (Stiasny-Kolster et al.  ). In the present study, a score\u2009\u2265\u20095 (with specificity =90% and sensitivity =87% in PD) was defined as probable RBD (Stiasny-Kolster et al.  ). HC with an RBDSQ score\u2009\u2265\u20095 were excluded. Patients with cognitive impairment (i.e. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score\u2009<\u200923) were also excluded (Nasreddine  ). \n\n\n### Analyses on demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nWe compared demographic and clinical characteristics between groups (HC, PD RBD- and PD RBD+). Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological measures included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (Johns  ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) (Yesavage and Sheikh  ), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Spielberger  ), Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson\u2019s disease (QUIP-S) (Weintraub et al.  ) and MoCA (Nasreddine  ). To compare motor symptom severity and disease stage, differences in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores (Goetz et al.  ) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage (Hoehn and Yahr  ) were tested in PD patients (PD RBD+ versus PD RBD-). Depending on the type of comparison (i.e., two-group or three-group comparison) and distribution of the variable, student t-tests, chi-square tests or one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA), followed by Hochberg\u2019s post hoc comparisons, were performed in SPSS version 21 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Significance threshold was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nTo minimize bias due to scanner differences, we selected the MRI scans acquired on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner from the same vendor (Siemens TrioTim 3.0\u00a0T and Siemens Verio 3.0\u00a0T). The PPMI board created an imaging manual to standardize data acquisition across the different study sites (details at  ). Typical MRI parameters were: repetition time 5\u201311\u00a0ms; echo time 2\u20136\u00a0ms; slice thickness 1\u20131.5\u00a0mm; inter-slice gap 0\u00a0mm; voxel size 1x1x1.2\u00a0mm; matrix 256 x minimum 160. \n\n\n### VBM preprocessing \n  \nWe conducted the VBM analyses in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) using the VBM8 toolbox ( ) running in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.). Quality of the scans was visually inspected by two independent raters, who were blinded to patient status, to exclude scans not suitable for further analysis (e.g., due to motion artifacts). Images were reoriented to the anterior/posterior commissural plane and segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. A group-specific template was created using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra; default settings). The segmented, modulated and normalised images were subsequently smoothed using a 10\u00a0mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Quality checks on the segmented and normalised images, such as segmentation errors, were performed through visual inspection. Sample homogeneity was checked with tools implemented in the VBM8 toolbox. \n\n\n### VBM analyses \n  \nWe performed ROI analyses of the bilateral putamen, thalamus and hippocampus using VBM. To prevent false-negative results, we also performed exploratory whole-brain VBM analyses. To compare PD RBD+ and PD RBD-, we performed a two-group comparison using a two-sample t-test. To study correlations between regional volume and RBDSQ score, we performed multiple regression analyses comprising the entire group of PD patients. To compare PD RBD+ and PD RBD- patients to HC, we performed three-group analyses (PD RBD+ versus PD RBD- versus HC) through ANOVA models. \n\nAge and sex were included in all statistical models as nuisance covariates and significance threshold was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, after correction for multiple testing using family-wise error (FWE). Only contiguous clusters with >50 voxels were considered significant. \n\n\n### Seed selection for structural covariance analyses \n  \nAlthough several methods are appropriate for assessment of SC (Evans  ), currently the \u2018seed-based\u2019 approach is the most widely used. We selected our seed regions within the a priori selected ROI\u2019s (i.e. the bilateral hippocampus, thalamus and putamen). \n\nWithin the hippocampus we selected the anterior hippocampus (AH) as seed region, because of its involvement in the limbic system, which is implicated in PD (Nigro et al.  ). The definition of the AH was derived from literature (Persson et al.  ). We modified the hippocampal region implemented in the Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas, using the Wake-Forest University PickAtlas tool 3.0 (Fig.  a).   \nSelected seeds within bilateral hippocampus (  a  ), thalamus (  b  ) and putamen (  c  ) for SC analyses \n  \n\nWithin the thalamus we selected the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) as the seed region, because of its involvement in the associative CSTC-circuit, which is affected in PD (Vriend et al.  ). The MDT was derived from the fsl-oxford-thalamic-connectivity-atlas (Behrens et al.  ) (Fig.  b). \n\nWithin the bilateral putamen we selected a 3.5\u00a0mm seed within the dorsal-caudal putamen (DCP), as previously described (Soriano-Mas et al.  ). The DCP was selected because of its involvement in the motor CSTC-circuit, which is disturbed in PD and is correlated with motor symptom severity (Vriend et al.  ). The MarsBar ROI toolbox was used to create a 3.5\u00a0mm sphere around MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u2009\u00b128, y\u2009=\u20091, z\u2009=\u20093 (Fig.  c). We extracted the grey volume of all six seeds for the SC analyses. \n\n\n### Structural covariance analyses \n  \nConsistent with the VBM analyses, we primarily compared differences in SC between PD RBD+ and PD RBD- patients in a two-group comparison using two-sample t-tests. Additionally, multiple regression analyses were used to test for correlations with RBDSQ score in the entire sample of PD patients. Secondary three-group analyses (PD RBD+ versus PD RBD- versus HC) were performed through ANOVA models. \n\nWe built six separate SPM models, one for each seed region. All variables were orthogonalized using an iterative Gram-Schmidt method (Soriano-Mas et al.  ). The models contained (in fixed order), the gray matter (GM) volume of the seed region, age and sex. The latter two were included as nuisance covariates. For the regression analyses, the orthogonalized RBDSQ score and the interaction between the orthogonalized RBDSQ scores and the seed volume (RBDSQ*volume) were additionally added to the model, consistent with Valk et al. ( ). We investigated both positive and negative correlations between the RBDSQ score and SC. Positive correlations would represent stronger SC between the seed region and other brain areas with increasing severity of RBD symptoms, while negative correlations would represent weaker SC between these regions. Statistical threshold was set at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05, FWE corrected. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nIn total, 271 participants with scans acquired on a 3.0 Tesla MRI Siemens scanner were available, of which 26 met our exclusion criteria (see Fig. ). Because of movement artifacts or other technical issues 10 additional scans had to be excluded. A total of 235 subjects (40 PD RBD+, 127 PD RBD-, 68 HC) was eligible for final analyses.   \nFlow chart depicting inclusion and exclusion of subjects \n  \n\nDemographic and clinical data are listed in Table\u00a0 . Disease duration, H&Y stage and UPDRS III score did not significantly differ between PD RBD+ and PD RBD-. We did not find an effect of patient group (PD RBD+ versus PD RBD- versus HC) on sex, age, educational level, ESS, MoCA, GDS-15 or QUIP-S. A significant effect of groups was found on STAI score (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001). Post-hoc correlation analysis of RBDSQ and STAI score showed a significant (although weak) positive correlation between the two variables (  r  \u2009=\u20090.229;   p  \u2009=\u20090.003). GDS-15 score did significantly differ between HC and PD RBD+, but not between PD RBD+ and PD RBD-.   \nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants \n  \n I   Mean (standard deviations) are presented and statistically compared. The following statistical tests were used:   ANOVA;  Pearson\u2019s \u03c7  test;  independent t-test \n\n II   When ANOVA showed significant between-group differences we performed a Hochberg\u2019s GT2 post-hoc analysis to clarify which groups were significantly different: *significant effect of group; **although HC and PD patients show significant differences, no difference was found between PD RBD+ and PD RBD-. Post-hoc p-values represented: (1) between PD RBD- and PD RBD+, (2) between HC and PD RBD-, (3) between HC and PD RBD+ \n\n III   Abbreviations: UPDRSIII: Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale part III; RBDSQ: REM sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire; ESS: Epworth Sleepiness Scale; STAI: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; GDS-15: Geriatric Depression Scale-15 \n  \n\n\n### ROI analyses \n  \nIn the two-group comparison, PD RBD+ patients showed smaller right putamen volume compared to PD RBD- (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u200930, y\u2009=\u2009\u22123, z\u2009=\u200912) (Table\u00a0 ). To ensure that this was not explained by the difference in STAI score, we performed a post-hoc analysis in which we included STAI score in the statistical model as a nuisance covariate. This correction did not alter the observed between-group difference (data not shown). In the two-group comparison we did not find group differences for thalamus or hippocampus.   \nOverview of VBM findings (ROI analyses) \n  \nAbbreviations: PD RBD+: Parkinson Disease patients with REM sleep Behavior Disorder; PD RBD-: Parkinson Disease patients without REM sleep Behavior Disorder; RBDSQ: REM sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire; FWE: Family Wise Error \n  \n\nIn the 3-group comparison, we found a significantly smaller right putamen volume in PD RBD+ patients compared to HC (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u200930, y\u2009=\u2009\u22129, z\u2009=\u2009\u22129, ke\u2009=\u20091449, pFWE\u2009=\u20090.009). There was no difference between PD RBD- and HC. Post-hoc exclusion of healthy controls with impulse control behaviors did not result in a different outcome. \n\nIn the regression analysis (including all PD patients), RBDSQ score correlated negatively with volume of the right putamen (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u200930, y\u2009=\u2009\u22123, z\u2009=\u200912), left hippocampus (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u2009\u221214, y\u2009=\u2009\u22126, z\u2009=\u2009\u221214 and x\u2009=\u2009\u221216, y\u2009=\u2009\u221221, z\u2009=\u2009\u221218), and left thalamus (MNI coordinates: x\u2009=\u2009\u221215, y\u2009=\u200924, z\u2009=\u2009\u22123) (Table   and Fig.\u00a0 ).

We found that PD RBD+ patients show a smaller right putamen volume. Furthermore, we demonstrated a negative correlation between RBD symptom severity and right putamen, left thalamic and left hippocampal volume. For the first time, we also studied differences between PD RBD+ and PD RBD- from a network perspective. There were, however, no differences in structural covariance PD RBD+ and PD RBD- patients. \n\nSmaller putamen volume was previously observed in iRBD (Ellmore et al.  ,  ), and Boucetta et al. recently found a smaller putamen volume in PD RBD+ as well (Boucetta et al.  ). We replicated this finding. As was postulated by Boucetta et al., smaller putamen volume in PD RBD+ may reflect more pronounced degeneration of dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathways (Moustafa et al.  ). Alterations in the putamen may in turn underlie the more severe motor symptoms associated with RBD in PD (Kim et al.  ; Rolinski et al.  ). Indeed, in our sample we found a significant negative correlation between putamen volume and motor symptom severity (data not shown). Interestingly, we did not find a significant difference in left putamen volume, which is in contrast with previous findings. This was also not evident when we tested at a less stringent threshold (  p  -value 0.001, uncorrected; data not shown). It is unclear whether our findings reflect actual asymmetry or have a different explanation. \n\nThe negative correlation between RBD symptoms severity and thalamic volume is in line with previous structural imaging studies of PD patients (Boucetta et al.  ; Salsone et al.  ). The thalamus is known to function as a \u2018relay station\u2019, between lower brain structures and the cortex, regulating various important brain functions, including sleep (Moustafa et al.  ). The thalamus is innervated by cholinergic neurons originating in the pedunculo-pontine nucleus (PPN) and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus (DLN) in the brain stem, nuclei that are implicated in RBD pathophysiology (Pepeu and Grazia Giovannini  ). Interestingly, a positron emission tomography (PET) study in PD patients showed that RBD is associated with decreased thalamic cholinergic innervation by these nuclei (Pepeu and Grazia Giovannini  ). Moreover, the presence of RBD predicts thalamic cholinergic deficits in PD (Muller et al.  ). One may postulate that (more pronounced) cholinergic denervation of the thalamus in PD RBD+ is associated with loss of thalamic volume. Furthermore, a post-mortem study found more pronounced Lewy body pathology in the thalamus of PD patients with sleep disorders, including RBD, compared to PD patients without sleep disorders (Kalaitzakis et al.  ). Extensive accumulation of Lewy bodies is associated with neurodegeneration and might in turn be associated with loss of volume. This might alternatively explain the smaller thalamic volume in PD RBD+. \n\nThe negative correlation between RBD symptom severity and hippocampal volume in PD patients is in line with preceding VBM studies (Kim et al.  ; Lim et al.  ). In contrast, Scherfler et al. showed a higher density of the bilateral hippocampus in iRBD patients, suggesting neuronal reorganization (Scherfler et al.  ). It was shown previously that abnormal hippocampal perfusion in iRBD can predict conversion to PD (Dang-Vu et al.  ). Although hippocampal alterations appear to be associated with PD-related RBD, it remains to be clarified whether these findings should be considered a primary mechanism or a secondary effect of the disorder. \n\nIn contrast with the ROI analyses, the whole-brain analyses showed no between-group differences, possibly due to our stringent correction for multiple testing. Nevertheless, this finding is in contrast with a recent PPMI whole-brain DBM-study, showing differences in PMT, MRF, hypothalamus, thalamus, putamen, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (Boucetta et al.  ). This discrepancy might be the result of differences in sample size or difference in technique (DBM versus VBM). Also, brainstem areas were not represented in our GM mask. \n\nOur study has several limitations. First, RBD diagnosis was not confirmed through polysomnography, the gold standard for a diagnosis of RBD. The RBDSQ that was used in the current study has a sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.56 for the diagnosis of RBD when a cut-off score of five points is used (Stiasny-Kolster et al.  ). The use of the RBDSQ has been recommended by the EFNS/MDS-ES/ENS scientist panel (Berardelli et al.  ). In spite of that, the lack of polysomnography could have affected our results. We could have overestimated PD patients with RBD and underestimated PD patients without RBD, which means that the PD RBD+ group could contain false positive patients. \n\nSecond, PPMI is a multicenter cohort study, and each study site used its own scanner. To minimize bias due to scanner differences, only MRI scans acquired on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner from the same vendor (Siemens) were selected. However, a bias introduced by inter-scanner variability remains a possibility. \n\nLastly, as we used a cross-sectional design, no conclusions with regard to causality can be drawn. It therefore remains unclear whether our findings indicate selective brain degeneration in PD causing RBD-associated symptoms, or that selective brain degeneration is a consequence of RBD. Longitudinal data, exploring structural differences between PD RBD+ and PD RBD- over time, will further increase our understanding of PD-related RBD in particular, and PD pathophysiology in general. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPresence of RBD and severity of RBD symptoms in PD are associated with smaller volumes of the putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6395547, "text_md5": "fcc5eef56d366ac2ad9d359803d8fbd4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 132], "journal": [133, 152], "publication_year": [154, 158], "title": [169, 265], "keywords": [279, 371], "abstract": [384, 1850], "body": [1859, 25219]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30155787, "doi": "10.1007/s11682-018-9939-4", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395547", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6395547"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395547\">6395547</a>", "list_title": "PMC6395547  Smaller subcortical volume in Parkinson patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder"}

The currently reported autoimmune encephalitis-related antibodies can be categorized as ( ): 1) autoantibodies against neuronal surface receptors, including the most common anti-NMDAR, as well as anti-GABA  receptor, anti-AMPAR, and anti-LGI1 antibodies; and 2) autoantibodies against neuronal intracellular antigens, including paraneoplastic syndrome-related antibodies such as anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Ma2, and anti-CV2. Among them, anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis is rare, and often manifests as choreic movements ( \u2013 ) and Parkinson-like symptoms ( ). Unlike other types of autoimmune encephalitis, bilateral symmetric leukoencephalopathy revealed by imaging is rare. \n\nIn this report, we present the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of one patient with anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis whose initial clinical manifestations at admission were Parkinson-like symptoms. The imaging results showed bilateral symmetric extensive leukoencephalopathy. \n\n\n## Case Report \n  \nThe patient was a Chinese Han housewife of 52 years old, without contact with animals, with normal body mass index, and a place of residence without particularity. She was admitted on August 6, 2018 due to the main complaint of \u201cslow movements and involuntary limb shaking for 3 months.\u201d The patient had been suffering from slow movements for 3 months before admission, without obvious cause for physical retardation, and manifesting as slow walking speed and inflexibility, small split-steps, difficulty in turning around, and gradually worsening involuntary resting tremor. Those symptoms were accompanied by limb numbness and fatigue, dizziness, speech disfluency, small voice, loss of taste, and occasional urinary incontinence. On the other hand, there was no prodromal symptoms such as fever and headache, as well as no loss of consciousness and no limb convulsion. The patient had undergone routine cerebrospinal fluid examination in another hospital, and there was no obvious abnormality in cytology and biochemistry, and no pathogens. The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, and treated with benserazide and acupuncture. The symptoms did not improve and the patient was transferred to our hospital. \n\nThe patient had no previous history of exposure to toxic substances and drugs, no history of hypertension and diabetes, and no alcohol and tobacco consumption. The patient's father had a history of cancer. The physical examination at admission showed that the vital signs were normal, no cardiopulmonary abnormalities were observed, and no swelling of the superficial lymph nodes was observed. The patient was conscious and coherent, but with panic gait and few facial expressions. Limb muscle strength was normal, limb muscular tension was increased, and resting tremor of the limbs could be observed. Breast physical examination revealed no obvious mass. The modified Rankin score (mRS) was four. Blood routine, urine routine, fecal routine, liver and kidney functions, and electrolyte were all within the normal ranges. Serum anti-HIV antibody, antibodies against   Treponema pallidum  , hepatitis C antibody, and TORCH virus antibody were negative. Thyroid function, tumor markers, and immune indicators were normal. Urinary cadmium, arsenic, manganese, mercury, chromium, and strontium, and blood lead were normal. Serum anti-CV2 antibody was positive. Anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Amphiphysin, anti-Tr, anti-GAD, anti-Yo, anti-Ma2, anti-NMDA receptor, anti-AMPA1 receptor, anti-AMPA2 receptor, anti-GABA  receptor, anti-LGI1, and anti-CASPR2 antibodies were negative. \n\nLung computed tomography (CT) and dynamic electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced MRI showed lesions in the white matter around the bilateral lateral ventricles and bilateral internal capsules, but there was no significant enhancement ( ). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showed that the N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak was decreased in the bilateral lateral ventricles; the Cho/NAA ratio was 2.49 (the left lateral ventricle was selected). Moreover, no Lip peak and lactic acid (lac) peak were observed. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-CT showed that there were highly suspicious nodules in the upper quadrant of the left breast. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic nodule at the 10 o'clock position of the left breast. The nodule encompassed an area of about 1.1 \u00d7 0.6 cm; the boundaries of the nodule were unclear, and the internal echoes were uneven with rich strip-like blood flow signals. The BI-RADS classification was 4b. \n  \nCranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a patient with anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis.   (A\u2013C)   T WI axial images.   (D\u2013F)   FLAIR axial images.   (G)   FLAIR coronal scan.   (H)   Enhanced MRI.   (I)   Diffusion-weighted MRI. The arrows indicate abnormal signals in the white matter area of the bilateral lateral ventricles and bilateral internal capsules. No significant enhancement was observed. \n  \nAt this point, the diagnoses was anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis and breast cancer. The patient was transferred to the Breast Surgery Department and underwent modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. Postoperative pathology revealed the presence of an invasive ductal carcinoma. Tumor heterogeneity was obvious under the fluorescence microscope. TNM staging was pT1cN0M0. The cancer was positive for estrogen receptors (ER; 90%), progesterone receptor (PR; 80%), HER2 (1+), hck (+), e-cadherin (+), and Ki-67 (8%), and negative for syn, cga, P63, and ck5/6. Fluorescence   in situ   hybridization (FISH) for HER2 was negative. \n\nThe resting limb tremors improved significantly by 1 week after operation. After surgery, the patient received oral toremifene. The patient was followed-up 9 months after surgery, and the results showed that limb muscle strength was normal. There was no involuntary limb shaking. There was only a slight speech disfluency and slightly slow movements. The mRS score was 1. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe patient was admitted with Parkinson-like symptoms and loss of taste. Serum anti-CV2 antibody was positive. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral leukoencephalopathy. A breast cancer was detected by PET and ultrasound. The resting tremors disappeared by 1 week after surgery. The mRS was four before surgery, and decreased to one by 9 months after surgery. This case suggests that anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis can manifest as Parkinson-like symptoms and bilateral leukoencephalopathy. PET can be useful to reveal occult cancers in patients with suspected paraneoplastic syndrome. In the presence of white matter lesions only and a cancer, surgery to remove the cancer without immunosuppressive therapy may achieve a good prognosis. \n\nCollapsing response mediator proteins-5 (CRMP-5) is a class of neuronal cytoplasmic proteins that are expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and thalamus of humans ( ). Their genes are located on human chromosome 2 ( ). CRMP-5 IgG is regarded as a neuronal autoantibody that may be a spontaneous immune response caused by small cell lung cancer and thymoma, and this antibody is not found in the blood of healthy subjects ( ). \n\nThe CV2 antibody can specifically recognize CRMP-5, and anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis is a rare form of autoimmune encephalitis. At present, the reported clinical presentation of anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis includes chorea ( \u2013 ,  ), involuntary movements ( ,  ), mental and behavioral abnormalities ( ,  ), hypomnesia ( ,  ,  ), convulsions ( ,  ), and ataxia ( ,  ,  ,  ). Moreover, there are rare cases with Parkinson-like symptoms ( ), visual impairment ( ,  ), myelitis ( ,  ), and olfactory disorders ( ,  ). The imaging features are mostly the involvement of striatum ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ), temporal lobes ( ,  ,  ,  ), insular lobes ( ,  ), and hippocampus ( ,  ). There are also rare cases with involvement of the optic nerve ( ), thalamus ( ), and extensive white matter ( ). In the patient presented here, the clinical symptoms were typical Parkinson symptoms. The patient was treated with benserazide in another hospital, but the symptoms did not improve. Imaging showed bilateral extensive leukoencephalopathy. The usual causes of leukoencephalopathy such as exposure to toxic substances and metabolic diseases were not observed. Therefore, the patient presented here is the first reported case of anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis with typical manifestations of Parkinson symptoms and bilateral extensive leukoencephalopathy. \n\nThe previously reported patients with anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis are all accompanied by malignant tumors, except for two cases reported by Vernino et al. ( ) and Muehlschlegel et al. ( ). Among the cancers reported to be associated with anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis, lung cancer, and thymic carcinoma are the most common, while testicular cancer, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer were observed occasionally. It is worth noting that there is only one case of anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis associated with breast cancer, but the patient was also suffering from lung cancer ( ). In the present case, lung CT showed no abnormality and whole-body PET-CT revealed no lesion except the breast lesion. Therefore, this patient is the first reported case of anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis who was only combined with breast cancer. \n\nAt present, immunosuppressive therapy is the main treatment for autoimmune encephalitis, but in the presence of a suspected paraneoplastic syndrome and a confirmed malignant tumor, standard cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.) should be performed by the corresponding specialists ( ). In the present case, hormones and other immunomodulatory treatments were not given and only cancer treatment was performed. After breast cancer surgery, the patient only had slightly speech disfluency and slow movements. The mRS score decreased from 4 to 1 without the use of immunosuppressive therapy, suggesting that immunosuppression may be not necessary for patients with autoimmune encephalitis combined with malignant tumors. \n\nIn conclusion, anti-CV2 autoimmune encephalitis can present as Parkinsonism with bilateral leukoencephalopathy on MRI. PET scanning can be useful to reveal an occult cancer. Treatment of the cancer may improve the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome without the need of immunosuppressive therapy. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Branch for Medical Research and Clinical Technology Application, Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University.

These findings may have diagnostic and functional implications but their value in   de novo   PD remains unknown. Here we analyzed longitudinal DTI data from Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative   de novo   PD patients for changes over time relative to healthy control (HC) participants. \n\n Methods:   Baseline and 1-year follow-up DTI MRI data from 71 PD patients and 45 HC PPMI participants were included in the analyses. Whole-brain fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images were compared for baseline group differences and group\u2013by\u2013time interactions. Baseline and 1-year changes in DTI values were correlated with changes in DTI measures and symptom severity, respectively. \n\n Results:   At baseline, PD patients showed significantly increased FA in brainstem, cerebellar, anterior corpus callosal, inferior frontal and inferior fronto-occipital white matter and increased MD in primary sensorimotor and supplementary motor regions. Over 1 year PD patients showed a significantly stronger decline in FA compared to HC in the optic radiation and corpus callosum and parietal, occipital, posterior temporal, posterior thalamic, and vermis gray matter. Significant increases in MD were observed in white matter of the midbrain, optic radiation and corpus callosum, while gray matter of prefrontal, insular and posterior thalamic regions. Baseline brainstem FA white matter (WM) values predicted 1-year changes in FA white matter and MD gray matter values. White but not gray matter changes in both FA and MD were significantly associated with changes in symptom severity. \n\n Conclusion:   Significant gray and white matter DTI alterations are observable at the time of PD diagnosis and expand in the first year of   de novo   PD to other cortical and white matter regions. This pattern of DTI changes is in line with preclinical and neuroanatomical studies suggesting that the increased spatial spread of alpha-synuclein neuropathology is the key mechanism of PD progression. Taken together, these findings suggest that DTI may serve as a sensitive biomarker of disease progression in early-stage PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of brain grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) integrity is a potentially valuable tool to quantify progressive neurodegeneration in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). In particular, two indices extracted from DTI \u2013 fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) \u2013 are commonly applied to study tissue integrity. FA provides an anisotropy measure of water diffusion presumably reflecting preferential directions of fiber orientation whilst MD quantifies the overall diffusivity reflecting tissue density or its loss in a longitudinal setting. A key working hypothesis of the underlying pathophysiological process leading to neurodegeneration and subsequent clinical decline in PD is that alpha-synuclein pathology starting in brainstem GM and WM progressively spreads through connected white matter fiber systems to cortical GM structures during the course of the disease ( ). If DTI alterations in PD indeed reflect the resulting neurodegenerative process due to alpha-synuclein pathology, these alterations would also be predicted to show a progressive spatial spread. Yet, most DTI studies to date in PD have focused on cross-sectional assessment of single regions of interest (ROI) such as substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or basal ganglia. These brain regions have been shown to be affected in PD and linked with its pathognomonic motor symptoms, although heterogeneity across studies is high (see  ;   for reviews). However, some whole-brain GM and WM studies also provided evidence for altered diffusion processes in other brain structures, including the cortex ( ;  ). Whilst MD has been consistently shown to be increased in PD, differential findings emerged with respect to the directionality of FA alterations, with studies reporting evidence of both increases and decreases in anisotropy measures ( ;  ). \n\nOnly very few studies to date focused on longitudinal characterization of DTI abnormalities in PD patients ( ;  ;  ;  ) and only one evaluated white matter FA and MD alterations in a   de novo   PD population ( ). Additionally, none of these studies evaluated the potential GM pathology as evaluated through FA and MD. It therefore remains unclear if and to what extent FA and MD alterations represent potential early diagnostic and progression biomarkers in PD patients. Moreover, it also remains unclear if these alterations reflect symptom severity or predict disease progression in the early PD population. \n\nHere we aimed to address the question of the value of GM and WM FA and MD as early diagnostic and progression biomarkers in a   de novo   PD population. We further evaluated the relationship between these imaging indices and clinical symptoms observed in the respective patient population. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe DTI sample comprised 116 Parkinson\u2019s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) participants who completed 1 year follow-up: 71 with a recent diagnosis of PD and 45 healthy control (HC) participants. PD and HC groups did not differ with respect to age or gender distribution, but did differ with respect to MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale,  ) subscale and total scores, as expected (see   Table   ). All PD patients were treatment na\u00efve at baseline but were allowed to start PD medication upon need. Only categorical (yes/no) information was recorded on the respective treatment categories ( -dopa, dopamine agonists or other PD medication). This study was carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. PPMI is a large multicenter study and each site independently received ethics approval of the protocol. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n  \nSubject group characteristics. \n    \n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nBaseline and 1-year follow-up examinations in the PPMI study included the administration of the MDS-UPDRS ( ). Cardiac-triggered DTI MR sequences were acquired on a Siemens 3T TIM Trio scanner using a 12-channel matrix head coil and a two-dimensional echo-planar DTI sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 900/88 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, voxel size = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm , 72 slices, 64 gradient directions with a   b  -value of 1000 s/mm . One non-gradient volume (  b   = 0 s/mm ) was also acquired. See ( ) and the online PPMI protocol  for details of the PPMI study and image acquisition, respectively. \n\n\n### DTI Image Processing \n  \nDetails of the PPMI DTI pre-processing pipeline including non-linear distortion correction and FA and MD computation can be found on the PPMI website . FA and MD maps were computed using the TEEM tool as described on the PPMI . All maps were downloaded with corresponding structural T1 scans. All further pre-processing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12,  ). To improve precision for longitudinal evaluation structural scans from different time points were first co-registered to a mean image from those time points for each subject. FA and MD maps were subsequently co-registered to the respective structural scans. The structural MRI was segmented into GM and WM compartments. FA and MD maps were then masked with the respective binarized compartments to obtain GM and WM FA and MD estimates and normalized into MNI space based on structural T1 information. A Gaussian smoothing kernel of 8 mm FWHM (full width at half maximum) was subsequently applied. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nAll voxel-wise statistical analyses of the imaging data were performed using SPM12. Subsequent statistical analyses of the extracted imaging eigenvariates and clinical data were computed using SPSS 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). We first compared the baseline FA and MD GM and WM maps between PD and HC controlling for the effects of age and sex using two-sample   t  -tests. We then tested for group\u2013by\u2013time interactions (i.e., differential FA and MD trajectories across PD and HC between baseline and 1-year follow-up) using a flexible factorial design including the factors group, time and subject and controlling for sex and baseline age. To correct for multiple comparisons, an exact permutation based cluster threshold (  p   < 0.05) was applied to all voxel-wise analyses combined with an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold of   p   < 0.01 ( ). Eigenvariates adjusting for the effects of covariates of no interest were extracted from the most significant clusters identified in baseline comparisons and group\u2013by\u2013time interaction analyses in each contrast. Effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s   d  ) for the differentiation between PD and HC and percent changes from baseline (for longitudinal analyses only) were then computed to estimate the magnitude of observed alterations. Using these eigenvariates, we then used general linear models to evaluate whether baseline alterations in FA and MD observed in PD were predictive of current clinical severity or 1-year changes in clinical severity as measured by MDS-UPDRS total or subscale scores while controlling for age, sex and treatment mode at follow-up (as random effects, for change prediction only). Similarly, we tested if these baseline DTI alterations were predictive of 1-year FA and MD alterations observed in the PD population in group\u2013by\u2013time interaction analyses controlling for age and sex. Further, we evaluated using general linear models if changes observed in FA and MD over time (all entered as covariates into a single model) were related to changes in function (MDS-UPDRS I, II, III, and total scores) while controlling for the random effects of PD medication status ( -dopa, dopamine agonists or other PD medication), age and sex. Lastly, we tested if medication may have affected disease progression effects on FA and MD identified in the above group\u2013by\u2013time interaction analyses. For this we computed analyses of variance in PD testing for treatment\u2013by\u2013time interactions on FA and MD alterations identified in the longitudinal analyses, controlling for age and sex. We thereby tested for effects of all three medication types recorded in the PPMI database ( -dopa, dopamine agonists, and other PD medication). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Imaging Alterations \n  \nAt baseline, significantly increased FA was observed in PD in midbrain, pons and cerebellum, anterior corona radiata, anterior corpus callosum and left inferior and inferior-occipital longitudinal fasciculus WM (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.17) (  Figure    and   Table   ). MD was increased in PD in bilateral primary sensorimotor and supplementary motor GM (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.38) (  Figure   ). No significant differences between PD and HC were observed in FA GM and MD WM. \n  \nResults of voxel-based morphometry analyses of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps.

Stronger FA GM decreases were thereby observed in PD in a cluster covering primarily bilateral parietal, occipital, posterior temporal and posterior thalamic and vermis regions. Similarly, stronger FA decreases were observed in PD in the underlying WM including the left optic radiation and anterior and middle corpus callosum. For MD, significantly stronger increases were observed in PD in GM (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.95, HC: 0.5%, PD: 2.8%) and WM (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.8; HC: 0.8%; PD: 3.6%) including, and bilateral medial and lateral prefrontal lobes, right insula and posterior thalamus GM and the midbrain WM, left optic radiation and anterior and middle corpus callosum (  Figure    and   Table   ). These differential longitudinal FA and MD changes observed in PD were not associated with PD medication status at follow-up (all   p   > 0.85). \n  \nResults of voxel-based morphometry analyses of mean diffusivity (MD) maps.

Baseline FA but not MD alterations in PD significantly predicted changes in WM FA [  F  (1,65) = 7.7,   p   = 0.007] and GM MD [  F  (1,65) = 4.1,   p   = 0.048] which had been observed in the group\u2013by\u2013time interaction analyses described above (  Figures   ). Higher baseline FA in the brainstem predicted stronger declines in FA in the posterior corona radiata and corpus callosum. Importantly, both MD and FA WM changes were significantly associated with changes in MDS-UPDRS total scores [FA:   F  (1,61) = 4.7,   p   = 0.034; MD:   F  (1,61) = 4.6,   p   = 0.036] but not with the MDS-UPDRS subscale scores (  Figures   ). FA and MD GM changes were not significantly associated with changes in symptom severity as measured by the MDS-UPDRS. \n  \nResults of regression analyses between baseline and longitudinal FA and MD values and clinical scores. Significant associations between baseline FA and longitudinal FA and MD changes are displayed in   (A)   and   (B)  . Significant associations between longitudinal FA and MD changes and changes in symptom severity as measured with the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale) are displayed in   (C)   and   (D)  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe find significant baseline FA and MD increases in   de novo   diagnosed PD patients\u2019 brainstem and subcortical WM and cortical GM. Within the first year after diagnosis, DTI abnormalities spread to significant portions of the initially unaffected cortex and WM. The progression of FA and MD changes in GM was spatially distinct, with MD changes localized to the frontal lobe regions, whereas FA changes were localized to parietal, occipital and posterior temporal regions. WM changes in both FA and MD co-localized in the posterior corpus callosum and corona radiata. Both FA and MD changes in WM but not in GM were clinically relevant, demonstrating significant correlations with changes in MDS-UPDRS total scores. \n\nPrevious research on diffusion alterations in PD have largely focused on abnormal cross-sectional findings in the substantia nigra ( ;  ) or ROI ( ), with a minority of studies adopting a hypothesis-free, whole-brain approach (for a review see  ). With respect to anatomical location of FA and MD alterations, our cross-sectional and longitudinal findings agree well with previous studies in more advanced PD reporting FA and/or MD alterations in the midbrain ( ;  ;  ;  ), cerebellum ( ;  ), anterior corona radiata ( ;  ), anterior corpus callosum ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), left inferior and inferior-occipital fasciculi ( ;  ;  ) and bilateral primary sensorimotor and supplementary motor areas ( ;  ). Most of these studies reported decreased FA and/or increased MD in the respective regions. Importantly, all of these studies focused on more advanced disease stages. In contrast, a more complex picture emerged from the present results in the   de novo   PD population with respect to the directionality of FA changes. Whilst our longitudinal data indeed suggest a faster FA decline in PD as compared to HC, at baseline, we observed only increases in WM FA in a wide-spread anatomical network including corticospinal tracts and subcortical WM. These discrepant findings with respect to FA as compared to results in more advanced PD patients point to a more complex picture of underlying pathology in particular at early clinical disease stages. Importantly, our findings are in line with two out of three previous studies in   de novo   PD reporting numerically increased FA values in white matter ( ;  ). FA directionality is often difficult to interpret in terms of underlying neuropathology. For example a selective loss of specific fiber directions in crossing-fiber regions may result in increased FA, whilst a general loss of fibers along a specific WM tract is expected to result in decreased FA. Additionally, depending on the original structure composition a neurodegenerative or a neuroinflammatory process (both being key contributors if PD) can lead to increases and decreases in FA. An increased baseline FA in   de novo   PD may therefore represent an example of the former situation or point to a different, more complex underlying neuropathology. We note that in particular the finding of increased FA in the corticospinal tract is in line with a recent   meta  -analysis reporting this region as only one showing consistently increased FA across studies ( ). Moreover, the significant correlation observed between this increased baseline FA and longitudinal FA and MD changes suggests that higher baseline FA is indeed associated with stronger FA loss and MD increase observed in the first year of follow-up. These findings support the relevance of this baseline FA values as a potential predictor of the future spread of pathology. \n\nFar fewer studies analyzed the longitudinal progression of DTI signals in PD. Most notably,   analyzed PPMI DTI data from 122 PD patients and 50 HCs using a WM and subcortical region of interest approach (ROI) based on the JHU-DTI-MNI (Type I WMPM) atlas . GM DTI findings were not analyzed, and the authors selected radial and axial, as opposed to mean, diffusivity measure for their analyses. Using this ROI approach, PD patients did not differ from controls in any WM or subcortical region of interest at baseline. However, in line with the present findings, FA declined significantly more rapidly in PD patients\u2019 substantia nigra, midbrain, thalamus, corpus callosum, and frontal white matter. FA changes in all ROIs were not associated with changes in MDS-UPDRS scores. We note that the present study\u2019s positive relationship between FA and MDS-UPDRS changes derived from global, as opposed to ROI, FA changes. Nevertheless, the converging findings between the present and   studies support the use of DTI to understand WM changes in   de novo   PD. Importantly, DTI based measures may provide complementary information in addition to other imaging modalities such as volumetric and resting state functional MRI. On one side, although volumetric MRI is very sensitive to alterations in regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness it provides little insight into the underlying gray and white matter microstructural changes. Such volumetric changes presumably reflect irreversible damage due to loss of the underlying tissue. On the other side, resting state functional MRI measures provide an insight into neural dysfunction, i.e., loss of activity or connectivity ( ). However, such local functional alterations may also reflect changes in the underlying structure (i.e., due partial volume effects) or damage of remote structures, i.e., reduced input ( ). In that sense, DTI provides a complimentary insight into the underlying microstructural changes in the respective regions. As diffusion processes may be affected by any alterations in tissue organization such as inflammatory, demyelinating or other processes, DTI provides a potentially more sensitive biomarker to pick up early microstructural changes in PD prior to tissue loss detected through volumetric MRI and without confounding factors related to interpretation of resting state functional MRI. \n\n demonstrated that alpha-synuclein-positive inclusions are present in the axons of PD patients, e.g., the intramedullary vagal axons from the dorsal motor vagal area, which itself contained many alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies. Moreover,   found that ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the central nucleus of the amygdala of patient brains with dementia with Lewy bodies were also alpha-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase positive, suggesting that the degeneration of terminal axons of affected substantia nigra neurons were the source of the amygdala pathology in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies ( ). Consistent with this spreading model, the present study found that baseline brainstem FA WM values significantly correlated with both 1-year changes in FA WM and MD GM values. These findings indicate that DTI may serve as a valuable biomarker of both disease progression and, extrapolating from   preclinical study, also drug efficacy in studies of disease-modifying agents. \n\nBurke and colleagues suggest that axonal damage in PD may occur prior to neuronal loss, as described in their \u201caxonal dying back\u201d model ( ;  ). The evidence for this claim derives primarily from various mouse models of PD [e.g., BAC, heterozygous null gene engrailed1 (En1), and Nurr1 transgenic mouse models], which all show axonal pathology prior to neuronal loss (for a review see  ). Correspondingly, in humans, circa 70% of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals are estimated to be lost at the timepoint of the PD diagnosis, while the level of neurodegeneration has only reached 30% of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons ( ). Moreover, a recent study of Alzheimer-related pathology suggests that DTI abnormalities may portend the downstream aggregation of pathological proteins: in a multi-model imaging study with MRI DTI and FTP tau PET,   demonstrated that abnormal MD in the hippocampal cingulum bundle predicted tau accumulation in the downstream-connected posterior cingulate cortex 2 years later in amyloid positive older individuals. We note that as in synucleinopathies, intraneuronal pathologically aggregated tau proteins in Alzheimer\u2019s disease are likewise hypothesized to spread from neuron to neuron along WM tracts ( ). Taken together, these findings suggest that DTI may be used not only as an early marker of alpha-synuclein pathology, but of future upstream neuronal cell loss and downstream pathological alpha-synuclein aggregation. \n\nThe present study demonstrated baseline brainstem and cortical abnormalities in   de novo   PD WM and GM with DTI, as expected, and a propagation of these abnormalities within the first year of   de novo   PD to include large swathes of cortical regions. Importantly, both the FA and MD changes were functionally relevant, as evidenced by significant correlations with changes in MDS-UPDRS total scores. The patterns of cortical WM neurodegeneration in PD mimicked those described during normal aging, with stronger FA effects in frontal and stronger MD effects in parietal regions, which together suggest a selective vulnerability of these brain regions. In the context of preclinical PD models suggesting an early affectation of axons affected by synucleinopathy (i.e., prior to neuronal loss) ( ), the present findings indicate that DTI-based measures of WM and GM integrity may represent powerful early biomarkers of disease progression in   de novo   PD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets analyzed for this study can be found in the PPMI data repository ( ). \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJD, FS, FB, and AB conceptualized the analysis plan.

Although thalamic DBS (ventral intermediate nucleus [Vim] of thalamus) has been shown to reduce tremor in 85-95% of patients, bradykinesia and rigidity often are not well controlled. The dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) that can directly be targeted with special diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging sequences has been shown as an efficient target for thalamic DBS. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is typically chosen in younger patients as the target for dopamine-responsive motor symptoms. This study investigates a one-path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and subthalamic implantation of DBS electrodes and possibly a combined stimulation strategy for both target regions. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study investigates a one path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and subthalamic implantation of DBS electrodes and a possibly combined stimulation strategy for both target regions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis is a randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded (patient- and observer-blinded), monocentric trial with three treatments, three periods and six treatment sequences allocated according to a Williams design. Eighteen patients will undergo one-path thalamic (Vim/DRT) and STN implantation of DBS electrodes. After one month, a double-blinded and randomly-assigned stimulation of the thalamic target (Vim/DRT), the STN and a combined stimulation of both target regions will be performed for a period of three months each. The primary objective is to assess the quality of life obtained by the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire (39 items) for each stimulation modality. Secondary objectives include tremor reduction (obtained by the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale, video recordings, the Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale, and by tremor analysis), psychiatric assessment of patients, and to assess the safety of intervention. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nAt the moment, the recruitment is stopped and 12 patients have been randomized and treated. A futility analysis is being carried out by means of a conditional power analysis. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe approach of the OPINION trial planned to make, for the first time, a direct comparison of the different stimulation conditions (Vim/DRT, compared to STN, compared to Vim/DRT+STN) in a homogeneous patient population and, furthermore, will allow for intraindividual comparison of each condition with the \u201cquality of life\u201d outcome parameter. We hypothesize that the combined stimulation of the STN and the thalamic (Vim/DRT) target will be superior with respect to the patients\u2019 quality of life as compared to the singular stimulation of the individual target regions. If this holds true, this work might change the standardized treatment described in the previous section. \n\n\n## Trial Registration \n  \nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02288468; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02288468 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6wlKnt2pJ); and German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00007526; https://www.drks.de/drks_ web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007526 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6wlKyXZZL). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTremor is the most salient symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (idiopathic Parkinson syndrome [IPS]). Other symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. As much as 75% of patients with IPS show resting tremor. Initially, tremor is typically unilateral and might be only visible during stressful situations. In the later stage of the disease it becomes bilateral. \n\nThe typical parkinsonian tremor is a resting tremor with or without an additional postural and/or kinetic tremor at the same tremor frequency. This is the most frequent tremor in Parkinson\u2019s disease, termed type I tremor. Less than 10% of Parkinson patients develop a resting tremor and a postural tremor of different frequencies, termed type II tremor. A minority of IPS patients present a postural and/or kinetic tremor only, termed type III tremor. \n\nAround 20% of patients with IPS will progress into candidates for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in an advanced stage of the disease. DBS has become a standard treatment for the advanced stages of IPS [ , , ]. Besides motor fluctuations, therapy refractory tremor (type I and to some extent type II) is one of the main indications of DBS in IPS [ ]. \n\nFirst studies have shown that thalamic DBS, which targets the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of thalamus, can effectively reduce Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) tremor (95%). In larger cohorts, this number was reduced to 85% favorable outcome [ , ]. It was also reported that the other symptoms of IPS are not favorably influenced with thalamic DBS and while tremor can be nicely controlled over the years, bradykinesia and rigidity are not well controlled under stimulation [ ]. We have recently provided evidence that a fiber structure, the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT), that traverses the thalamic Vim region is a powerful target of thalamic Vim DBS. This structure can be directly targeted with the aid of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) sequences [ ]. The use of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS shows effects on tremor but typically does not have dramatic initial effects on tremors like Vim-DBS does. However, STN DBS also reduces the other cardinal symptoms of IPS which Vim-DBS does not [ ] [ ]. There are anecdotal reports on pure STN stimulation's inability to effectively reduce tremor, hence the need to additionally stimulate the thalamic region. However, in recent years, STN stimulation has become the main treatment option for refractory IPS. The main indication for STN-DBS remains fluctuations in movement after long-standing dopaminergic medication [ ]. Patients who suffer from tremor on top of these symptoms (equivalent type IPS) and who show some improvement with dopaminergic medication are likely to improve under STN-DBS [ ]. However, different considerations apply for tremor-dominant IPS with therapy refractory tremor: \n  \nIn younger patients with tremor-dominant IPS, STN-DBS rather than thalamic (Vim/DRT) DBS appears to be the better option because early onset IPS is known to enter motor fluctuations in a later stage of the disease. These symptoms will likely respond to STN-DBS. \n  \nOlder patients who suffer from tremor-dominant IPS are less likely to develop motor fluctuations. Because of the higher complication rate of stimulation of the STN in this patient group [ ], thalamic DBS is typically recommended. \n  \nEspecially older patients receiving thalamic DBS might\u2014in a later stage of the disease\u2014suffer from insufficient symptom control and these patients might benefit from additional STN surgery [ ]. At this time, however, these patients might already be in a risk group for STN-DBS [ ]. \n  \nWith this study, we will try to understand if patients with tremor-dominant IPS or patients with equivalent type IPS who perceive tremor to be their dominant symptom will benefit from a one-path thalamic and STN implantation of DBS electrodes and, possibly, a combined stimulation strategy for both target regions that is adjustable for the distinct target regions over time. Disease-related quality of life was chosen as the primary outcome. As it has been shown in the EARLYSTIM Study, this allows a global assessment of beneficial and adverse effects in a way that subjectively matters to the patient [ ]. \n\n### Trial Purpose and Rationale \n  \nThe proposed trial aims to investigate a combined approach to thalamic/subthalamic DBS for the treatment of patients with tremor-dominant IPS or patients with equivalent type IPS who perceive tremor to be their dominant symptom. As stated above, consensus exists for the application of STN versus thalamic (Vim/DRT) DBS in different age groups. While the younger age group appears to be clear candidate for STN-DBS, the older patient group (>60 years) remains to be problematic because of the above-mentioned reasons. \n\nAt the beginning of recruitment we could not detect any controlled study with an intrapatient comparison of thalamic versus STN DBS. We have performed a PubMed search (search as of 15 October 2014) with the search terms \u201cDBS AND tremor AND Parkinson AND Vim AND STN\u201d. In addition, we performed a search for (currently running) clinical trials on the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (search as of 15 October 2014) with the search terms \u201cDBS tremor parkinson\u201d and \u201cDBS tremor\u201d and we did not find any other comparable trial recruiting and/or treating PD patients. There are case series only describing patients who had previous thalamus operation (Vim/DRT-DBS) and later received additional electrodes in the STN [ , ]. \n\nRecently we implanted bilateral octopolar DBS electrodes in the STN additionally traversing the DRT region via a parietal image-assisted approach in two patients allowing compassionate use of a combined stimulation of two tremor targets (STN and DRT) [ ]. Both patients showed immediate and sustained improvement of their tremor and the symptoms of the bradykinetic syndrom, bilaterally. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design \n  \nThis is a randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded (patient- and observer-blinded), monocentric trial with three treatments, three periods, and six treatment sequences allocated according to a Williams design. The trial flow is illustrated in  . This monocentric study will be conducted at the Department of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery in close collaboration with the Department of Neurology, both at the Freiburg University Medical Center, Germany. \n\nThe primary objective of this trial is to assess whether Quality of Life (QoL), obtained by the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) in Parkinson patients with combined Vim/DRT-DBS and STN-DBS is superior to treatment with either Vim/DRT-DBS or STN-DBS. This will be determined through assessment over a period of three months after implantation of Boston Scientific\u2019s Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Vim/DRT into the STN using a posterior trajectory. \n\nThe secondary objectives are: \n  \nTo show advantage of combined STN+Vim/DRT-DBS in tremor reduction in comparison to Vim/DRT-DBS or STN-DBS obtained by Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (FTMTRS), video recording, the Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (UPDRS, part III, items 20 & 21), and by tremor analysis \n  \nTo show superiority of combined STN+Vim/DRT-DBS in motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease in comparison to Vim/DRT-DBS or STN-DBS obtained by Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (UPDRS, part III except items 20 & 21) \n  \nPsychiatric assessment of patients \n  \nTo assess safety of intervention \n  \n\n### Participant Recruitment \n  \nPatients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease who are referred to our department due to disabling medically resistant resting and/or postural tremor as their major complaint are informed about this study. Patients who give their informed consent are registered in the trial and undergo the screening procedures. Patients who gave their informed consent but do not undergo stereotactic surgery are regarded as screening failures. \n\nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease of both genders will be enrolled into this trial. No gender ratio has been stipulated. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listen in  . \n\nA sample size of 18 male or female patients was calculated (details below). Recruitment will be stopped after the twelfth patient has completed his/her end of study visit (visit W40, 40 weeks after implantation of DBS system). A futility analysis will be carried out by means of a conditional power analysis. Based on the results of this analysis the study will either be continued or stopped. \n\n\n### Study Events and Assessments \n  \n#### Screening \n  \nScreening assessments will be performed within 28 days prior to implantation. The patient will be admitted to hospital for this visit and inclusion and exclusion criteria are checked and validated. The complete pretherapeutic work-up includes a physical examination, consisting of a neurological examination and vital signs (including weight and height), medical history, demography, a pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, PDQ-39, UPDRS, FTMTRS with Video recording, CGI-I, tremor analysis, psychiatric assessment, PD medication, concomitant medication, L-Dopa equivalent dose (LED) and a cranial MRI. \n\n\n#### Implantation of the Investigational Medical Device \n  \nThe investigational medical device (IMD) for this study is Boston Scientific\u2019s Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System. This device is CE-marked but will not be used within the intended use for this clinical trial. The IMD will be implanted and programmed by the investigator. The investigator or authorized study personnel will document the implantation of each device in the respective forms. The patient will be admitted to hospital and the following assessments will be performed: (1) cranial computed tomography before implantation (planning); (2) cranial computed tomography after implantation (corroboration of electrode position); (3) concomitant medication; and (4) adverse events. \n\n\n#### Imaging \n  \nAnatomical and diffusion tensor imaging is performed on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI system (Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim System 3T, Erlangen, Germany) a day before surgery under mild sedation with oral Lorazepam (1 - 2.5mg, Pfizer, Berlin, Germany) using a 12-channel head coil. \n   Inclusion and exclusion criteria.   \nInclusion criteria \n  \nMale or female patients aged \u2265 35 and \u2264 75 years with a life expectancy of at least 5 years \n  \nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease according to the criteria of the British Brain Bank as diagnosed by a neurologist specialized in movement disorders \n  \nParkinson patients are included with a medical treatment resistant and disabling resting and/or postural tremor as their major complaint and with a less prominent or absent hypokinetic-rigid component of their disease. \n  \nAbsence of postural instability (which could be aggravated under STN DBS) \n  \nHoehn & Yahr stage 1-3.

The energy generated by diathermy can be transferred to the Vercise DBS System, causing tissue damage at the contact site resulting in severe patient injury or death. \n  \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Patients implanted with the Vercise DBS System should not be subjected to MRI. \n  \nPatient incapability: Patients who are unable to properly operate the Remote Control and Charging System should not be implanted with the Vercise DBS System. \n  \nPoor surgical risks: The Vercise DBS System is not recommended for patients who\u2011\u2014because of their primary disease or additional co-morbidities\u2014are not likely to benefit from the DBS system implantation. \n       \nAnatomical sequences: \n  \nThree-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE), repetition time (TR) 1 390 ms, echo time (TE) 2.15 ms, inversion time (TI) 800 ms, Flip angle 15\u00b0, voxel-size 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.0 mm , acquisition time 3:15 min. \n  \n3D T2 SPACE-sequence, TR 2 500 ms, TE 231 ms, echo train length 141, flip angle variable, voxel-size 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.0 mm , acquisition-time 6:42 min. \n    \nDiffusion tensor imaging: \n  \nSingle shot 2D SE EPI, TR 10 000 ms, TE 94 ms, Diffusion Values b=0 s/mm\u00b2, b=1000 s/mm\u00b2, diffusions-directions 61, slice count 69, voxel-size 2.0\u00d72.0\u00d72.0 mm , acquisition time 11:40 min. Deformation correction of the EPI sequence according to Zaitsev et al. 2004 [ ]. \n    \nDeterministic Fiber tracking is performed on a Linux workstation using StealthViz DTI (Medtronic Navigation, Louisville, Colorado). An internal transfer procedure is used to fuse the line-graphic depiction of the DRT to the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image that further serves for navigation purposes. With this procedure, the DRT becomes part of the stereotactic planning data. Fiber tracking of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network (DRT) and surrounding structures (cortico-spinal tract) have been previously described [ , - ]. \n\n\n#### Surgical procedure \n  \nAfter administration of standard antibiotic prophylaxis, a stereotactic frame (Leksell, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) was placed under local anesthesia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed and the image data were transferred to the planning workstation (Framelink 5.0, Medtronic SNT, Louisville, CO). The previously acquired MRI sequences and the DTI FT rendition of the DRT (as part of the stereotactic DICOM data) were coregistered with the stereotactic CT scan and the trajectories were planned taking into account mid-commissural point (MCP) coordinates (for STN we typically use: x=12; y-2, z=-4) and imaging of the targeted structures (DRT and STN). Where necessary, based on the imaging, the target was refined based on the direct visualization of the structures. \n\n\n#### Description of the Operation \n  \nAfter administration of standard antibiotic prophylaxis, a stereotactic frame (Leksell, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) is placed under local anesthesia. A CT scan is performed and the image data are transferred to the planning workstation (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). The previously acquired MRI sequences are coregistered with the CT scan and the trajectories are planned, taking into account MCP coordinates and imaging of the targeted structures (Vim/DRT and STN). \n\nThe bilateral DBS electrode implantation is performed under local anesthesia with the patient in a semisitting position. Using a microtargeting drive (MicroTargeting Star Drive M/E System, FHC Inc, Bowdoin, ME) a test electrode (Cosman Medical, Inc, Burlington, MA) is inserted through a parietal burr hole in the cranium (see  ). Because of anticipated transventricular routes we do not to use sharp microelectrodes for microrecording, but instead rely on the imaging taking into account that the anterior, lateral, and STN (superior sensorimotor or dorsolateral STN) must be targeted [ ]. Macrostimulation is performed to confirm a contralateral clinical benefit (tremor reduction at a low threshold for DRT, additional reduction of bradykinesia and rigidity more distally on the trajectory, in the STN) and to test for side effects (at a high threshold) in 2mm steps starting 4 mm above the individual target regions. The definitive DBS electrodes are then implanted under fluoroscopic control. An implantable pulse generator (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) is implanted under general anesthesia during the same procedure. Postoperatively, all patients undergo a 3D CT scan to corroborate the final DBS electrode localization. \n\n\n#### 1 Month Off Period \n  \nAfter implantation, the IMD will remain OFF for a period of 1 month. After implantation of a DBS electrode into the thalamic (Vim/DRT) or the subthalamic (STN) target area, most patients will experience a transient alleviation of their symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia for STN, tremor for Vim/DRT). This is due to a microlesioning effect from electrode placement. This effect can last as short as days but can also last weeks. During this period programming is complicated because it is hard to differentiate between lesion and stimulation effects. Clinical practice shows that an interval of 3-4 weeks is sufficient between implantation and start of stimulation to get rid of most microlesioning effects. In this interval, medication can be expected to be kept unchanged because of the characteristics of the study population regarded here. \n\n\n\n### Week 4 (Baseline, treatment start) \n  \nWithin 7 days prior to treatment start the patient will be randomized. \n\n\n### Assessments at visit Week 4 \n  \nThe patient will be admitted to hospital for this visit. The following assessments have to be performed: PDQ-39, UPDRS, FTMTRS, CGI-I, video recording, tremor analysis, psychiatric assessment, vital signs (including weight), PD medication, concomitant medication, LED, and adverse events. \n\n\n### Treatment start \n  \nStimulation procedure is conducted by an unblinded investigator, who is not involved in data acquisition. All stimulation contacts will first be checked for impedance as an indicator for cable break, short-circuit or other device-related complications prior to stimulation. Afterwards all eight contacts will be tested for clinical effect on both tremor and hypokinetic-rigid symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia). Thresholds for side effects and side effects will be evaluated. Therapeutic effects and adverse effects (and between them the therapeutic window) will be noted in a standardized protocol. Stimulation settings will then follow the randomization of the area which has to be stimulated (Vim/DRT, STN or, Vim/DRT-STN). Stimulation parameters are set empirically on the estimation of the investigator based on the testing phase of electrode contacts, with tremor being the primary target symptom. \n  \nThe proposed approach (left) and the traditional approach (right) to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) (1) and STN (2) stimulation sites.\u00a0AC: anterior commissure; PC: posterior commissure; MCP: mid-commissural point; MC: primary motor cortex; CST: cortico-spinal tract; STP superior thalamic peduncle; DRT: dentato-rubro-thalamic tract; thal: thalamus; CI: internal capsule; Vim: ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus stereotactic target (possibly this is the Vop ventralis oralis posterior nucleus), ml: medial lemniscus; pSTR: posterior subthalamic region; STN: subthalamic nucleus; cZI: caudal zona incerta; RN: red nucleus; SNr: substantia nigra; SCP: superior cerebellar peduncle; DN: dentate nucleus.\u2028 Figure from [ ]. \n  \n\n### Week 6, 8 and 12 \n  \nThese visits can be performed either via telephone or at the clinical site. The following assessments have to be performed: PD medication, concomitant medication, LED, and adverse Events. \n\n\n### Week 16 (first Treatment Switch) \n  \nIf clinically indicated, the patient will be admitted to hospital for this visit. The following assessments have to be performed: PDQ-39, UPDRS, FTMTRS, CGI-I, video recording, tremor analysis, psychiatric assessment, vital signs (including weight), PD medication, concomitant medication, LED, and adverse events. \n\nStimulation settings follow the randomization of the area, which has to be stimulated (Vim/DRT, STN or Vim/DRT+STN).

In this case, recruitment will be stopped and the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will discuss continuation of the trial. Bleeding rate is known to be between 1-3% and approx. 0.78% of patients experience a clinically significant bleeding [ ] (eg, life changing complications because of persisting disabilities). Therefore, it seems appropriate to temporarily hold the trial if two or more patients out of the first six implanted subjects experience the aforementioned severe complications. \n  \nFollowing recommendation of the DMC (eg, after futility analysis) the coordinating investigator considers that the termination of the trial is necessary \n  \nThe question(s) addressed in the trial can be clearly answered on the basis of an interim analysis \n  \nThe questions(s) addressed in the trial can be clearly answered on the basis of results of another trial on the same subject \n  \nAn insufficient recruitment rate makes a successful conclusion of the clinical trial appear impossible (eg, less than 3 patients are recruited per year) \n  \n\n#### Premature Discontinuation of Deep Brain Stimulation \n  \nDBS therapy of a patient will be terminated prematurely in the following cases: \n  \nAdverse events (including intercurrent illnesses) which preclude further treatment with the IMD or make further participation in the clinical trial inadvisable because the informational value of the trial results is impaired \n  \nPremature termination of the trial treatment is considered to be medically indicated, eg, because it is subsequently found that inclusion/exclusion criteria were violated \n  \nContinuation of the trial treatment is unacceptable when the risks outweigh the benefits. This is the case if stimulation treatment induces unstable gait and falls or unbearable side effects like severe dyskinesia. \n  \nPregnancy \n  \nSignificant violations of the trial protocol or lack of compliance on the part of the patient \n  \nLogistical reasons (patient changes his/her doctor or hospital or moves to another location) \n  \nFollow-up visits will be performed as far as possible. \n\n\n#### Premature Termination of Trial Participation \n  \nThe trial patient can withdraw his/her consent at any time, without having to give reasons, and have his/her entire trial participation terminated prematurely. If a patient withdraws informed consent no further follow-up is possible. \n\n\n\n### Biostatistical Planning and Analysis \n  \nBefore the start of the final analysis a detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared. This will be completed during the \u201cblind review\u201d of the data, at the latest. This blind review, ie, a checking and assessment of the data, will be performed before the futility analysis and the planned follow-up period without looking at the randomized treatment for each patient. If the statistical analysis plan contains any changes to the analyses outlined in the trial protocol, they will be marked as such, and reasons for amendments will be given. \n\nAll statistical programming for analysis will be performed with the Statistical Analysis System. \n\n#### Sample Size Calculation \n  \nBased on the standard error of PDQ-39 total score in the EARLYSTIM trial [ ], we anticipate a within-person standard deviation of about 14.4 score points for the difference between two treatments. If 18 patients (3x6) are allocated to each of the 6 sequences, a two-sided t-test (analysis of variance for difference of means in crossover designs) at significance level 5% has 80% power to detect a difference if the true mean difference between STN+Vim/DRT-DBS and STN-DBS (or Vim/DRT-DBS) is 10.2 points (effect size: 0.71; nQuery Advisor version 7.0). \n\n\n#### Randomization \n  \nFax randomization will be performed within 7 days prior to treatment start. The patient identification code assigned for the trial will be entered on the randomization form and the fully completed form will then be faxed to the Central Randomization Office of the Clinical Trials Unit. Patients will be randomized to 6 treatment sequences. The block-lengths will be documented separately and will not be disclosed. The randomization code will be generated by the Clinical Trials Unit using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigative staff. Patients will be randomized to 6 treatment sequences according to a Williams design. The randomization code will be produced by validated programs based on the Statistical Analysis System. \n\n\n#### Blinding \n  \nParticipating patients and (external) observers and raters are blinded. Since stimulation procedure (eg, start of treatment, treatment switch, adjusting of stimulation parameters/settings) is conducted by an unblinded investigator who is not involved in data acquisition, blinding will be maintained for patients and for observers and raters. \n\n\n#### Description of the Primary Efficacy Analysis and Population \n  \nAnalysis of the primary endpoint will be done by intention to treat in a linear mixed model with baseline score, treatment, period and sequence included as fixed effects [ ], and within-patient correlation modelled by a compound symmetry covariance matrix to account for the random subject effect. The sequence effect will be dropped if nonsignificant at the 5%-level. In the final model, treatment comparisons will be based on contrasts estimated by least-squares means with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. For confirmatory analysis, a closed test procedure will be applied: First, the null-hypothesis of equal means in the three arms will be tested at a significance level of 5%. Only if it can be rejected will the three pairwise treatment comparisons be carried out in a confirmatory fashion. This multiple test procedure assures control of the multiple type I error rate of 5%. In addition, all fixed effects will be tested descriptively at the two-sided 5%-level. Recruitment will be stopped after 12 patients have been randomized and treated. Then, a futility analysis will be carried out by means of a conditional power analysis. The conditional probability to attain a significant result for STN+Vim/DRT-DBS versus STN-DBS and Vim/DRT-DBS, respectively, after recruitment of another 6 patients, given the results of the first 12 patients, will be estimated. Three scenarios will be considered: (1) the effect size for the 6 patients to follow will be estimated from the results of the first 12 patients, (2) the upper (optimistic) limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the treatment effects estimated from the first 12 patients will be used, and (3) the treatment effect for the 6 patients to follow will be assumed to be 10.2 points as anticipated in the sample size calculation. The optional possibility to stop the trial prematurely for futility after this interim analysis does not inflate the type one error rate. If the conditional power is below 30% in all three chosen scenarios the trial will be stopped. If the conditional power of any of the three scenarios is between 30-50%, the DMC will decide on the continuance of the trial. If the conditional power of any of the three scenarios is above 50% the trial will be continued. \n\n\n\n### Ethics and Dissemination \n  \nAn adequate subject insurance contract has been taken out. The study protocol has been approved by the independent Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg (reference number EK 38/15) and by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (reference number 94.1.04 - 5660 \u2013 9558). The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the DIN EN ISO 14155, and applicable regulatory requirements (eg, German Medical Devices Act, Ordinance on Clinical Trials with Medical Devices). The OPINION trial has been registered in the publicly available registries: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02288468) and German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00007526). \n\n#### Informed consent \n  \nBefore enrolment in the clinical trial, the patient will be informed that participation in the clinical trial is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the clinical trial at any time without having to give reasons and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. \n\nThe treating physician will provide the patient with information about the treatment methods to be compared and the possible risks involved. At the same time, the nature, significance, implications, expected benefits and potential risks of the clinical trial and alternative treatments will be explained to the patient. During the informed consent discussion, the patient will also be informed about the insurance cover that exists and the insured's obligations. The patient will be given ample time and opportunity to obtain answers to any open questions. All questions relating to the clinical trial should be answered to the satisfaction of the patient. In addition, the patient will be given a patient information sheet which contains all the important information in writing. The patient's written consent must be obtained before any trial-specific tests/treatments. For this purpose, the written consent form will be personally dated and signed by the trial patient and the investigator conducting the informed consent discussion. \n\n\n#### Safety \n  \nAdverse Events will be documented in the case report form and in the patient\u2019s medical chart (source documents). Serious Adverse Events will be reported according to the provisions set forth in the German Medical Devices Safety Plan Ordinance. \n\n\n\n### Data Monitoring Committee \n  \nThe DMC will consist of the coordinating investigator and the unblinded investigators. As stated above, the trial will be stopped if the conditional power is below 30% in all three scenarios; the trial will continue if the conditional power of any of the three scenarios is above 50%. If the conditional power is between 30\u201350% the DMC will decide on the continuance of the trial. For this purpose, the DMC will receive unblinded trial data and will discuss whether or not continuation of the trial is ethically justified. \n\nThe DMC will also receive data on severe intracranial hemorrhages or ischemias or infections and/or severe neurological deteriorations. In case of higher occurrence rates than expected, the DMC will discuss whether the trial should be stopped prematurely. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nRecruitment to the OPINION trial opened in July 2015 and will close in September 2019. At the time of manuscript submission, the recruitment is stopped; 12 patients have been randomized and treated and a futility analysis is being carried out by means of a conditional power analysis. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe approach planned to investigate in the OPINION trial will, for the first time, allow for the direct comparison of the different stimulation conditions (Vim/DRT, STN, and Vim/DRT+STN) in a homogeneous patient population and will furthermore allow an intraindividual comparison of each condition with the outcome parameter \u201cquality of life\u201d. We hypothesize that the combined stimulation of the STN and the thalamic (Vim/DRT) target will be superior with respect to the patients\u2019 quality of life as compared to the singular stimulation of the individual target regions. If this holds true, this work might change the standardized treatment described in the previous section. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5811645, "text_md5": "e3b35f5ed62042f6803b8dbd2b4b9132", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 170], "journal": [171, 186], "publication_year": [188, 192], "title": [203, 396], "keywords": [410, 567], "abstract": [580, 3854], "body": [3863, 38171]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29382631, "doi": "10.2196/resprot.8341", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5811645", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5811645"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5811645\">5811645</a>", "list_title": "PMC5811645  One Pass Thalamic and Subthalamic Stimulation for Patients with Tremor-Dominant Idiopathic Parkinson Syndrome (OPINION): Protocol for a Randomized, Active-Controlled, Double-Blinded Pilot Trial"}

Given the sensorimotor-lateral substantia nigra (SN) selective degeneration associated with PD, we posit that a relative sparing of the limbic-medial SN in the context of DRT drives impulsive, reward-seeking behavior in PD patients with recent history of severe impulsivity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nImpulsive and control participants were selected from a consecutive list of PD patients receiving pre-operative deep brain stimulation (DBS) planning scans including 3T structural MRI and 64 direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Using previously identified substantia nigra (SN) subsegment network connectivity profiles to develop classification targets, split-hemisphere target-based SN segmentation with probabilistic tractography was performed. The relative subsegment volumes and strength of connectivity between the SN and the limbic, associative, and motor network targets were compared. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur results show that there is greater probability of connectivity between the SN and limbic network targets relative to motor and associative network targets in PD patients with recent history of severe impulsivity as compared to PD patients without impulsivity (  P\u00a0=\u00a00.0075  ). We did not observe relative volumetric subsegment differences across groups. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFirstly, our results suggest that fine-grained, atlas-derived classification targets may be used in PD to parcellate and classify functionally distinct subsegments of the SN, with the apparent preservation of previously reported topographical limbic-medial SN, associative-ventral SN, and sensorimotor-lateral SN orientation. We suggest that relative, as opposed to absolute, degeneration amongst SN-associated dopaminergic networks relates to the impulsivity phenotype in PD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n Introduction  \n\nImpulse control disorders (ICDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that involve pleasurable behaviors performed repetitively, excessively, and compulsively (Gatto & Aldinio, 2019; Jimenez-Urbieta et\u00a0al., 2015; Maloney, Djamshidian, & O'Sullivan, 2017; Weintraub, David, Evans, Grant, & Stacy, 2015). The major manifestations of ICDs include pathological gambling (PG), hypersexuality (HS), compulsive buying/shopping (CB), and binge eating (BE) (Gatto & Aldinio, 2019). ICDs and related disorders have been included in the behavioral spectrum of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD), and can often lead to financially, legally, and psychosocially devastating consequences with a disproportionate impact on patients\u2019 quality of life (Phu et\u00a0al., 2014; Voon et\u00a0al., 2009; Weintraub et\u00a0al., 2015). \n\nICDs occur in 17.1% to 28.6% of PD patients on dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) (Antonini et\u00a0al., 2017; Weintraub et\u00a0al., 2010). Although DRT alone can influence reward-learning and increase impulsive behavior, the fact that ICDs only effect a subset of PD patients on equivalent DRT doses suggests the presence of intrinsic susceptibility factors underpinning the appearance of ICDs (Frank, Seeberger, & O'Reilly R, 2004; Tremblay, Hollerman, & Schultz, 1998; Voon et\u00a0al., 2017). The relationship between PD pathology, dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), and ICDs is still incompletely understood (De Micco, Russo, Tedeschi, & Tessitore, 2018). Besides demographic, genetic, and psychosocial variables, multiple imaging studies have identified morphologic and connectivity differences amongst PD patients with and without ICDs. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have identified an association between the presence of ICDs in PD and a decrease in dopamine receptor availability in the ventral-limbic striatum, but not in the dorsal-motor striatum (Cilia et\u00a0al., 2010; O'Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2011; Payer et\u00a0al., 2015; Steeves et\u00a0al., 2009). These findings suggest an imbalance in dopamine signaling between sensorimotor-nigrostriatal and reward/learning-mesolimbic networks in PD patients with ICDs and have been interpreted according to either a hypo- or hyperdopaminergic theory. The hyperdopaminergic theory posits that decreased dopamine receptor availability reflects increased dopaminergic tone and as such DRT acts on the dopamine-depleted dorsal striatum and a relatively intact ventral striatum, reducing inhibitory signaling and leading to impairments in impulse control (De Micco et\u00a0al., 2018; Gatto & Aldinio, 2019; Houeto, Magnard, Dalley, Belin, & Carnicella, 2016). Alternatively, these PET findings have been interpreted according to a hypodopaminergic theory in which decreased receptor availability stems from reduced dopaminergic neuron density and increased impulsivity may result from premorbid vulnerability in striatal connectivity to inhibitory regions (Hammes et\u00a0al., 2019). \n\nThe loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) precipitates the cardinal motor symptoms of PD (Fearnley & Lees, 1991). Importantly, the progressive loss of DA neurons in PD begins in the ventrolateral portions of the SN with relative sparing of medial dopaminergic neurons at early stages (Duke, Moran, Pearce, & Graeber, 2007; Fearnley & Lees, 1991). This topographically-selective degeneration pattern is distinct from the dorsomedial SN-focused loss of dopaminergic neurons associated with normal aging (Fearnley & Lees, 1991). Recently, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography-based parcellation scheme revealed a tripartite functional connectivity profile amongst SN sub-segments: the medial SN (mSN) most strongly connected to the ventral striatum and limbic networks; the lateral SN (lSN) most strongly connected to the dorsal striatum and sensorimotor networks; and the ventral SN (vSN) most strongly connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associative/executive networks (Zhang, Larcher, Misic, & Dagher, 2017). These results were consistent with the functional, topographic organization of the SN formerly observed in primate models using electrophysiologic and tracer stain experiments (Haber, 2014; Haber & Knutson, 2010; Matsumoto & Hikosaka, 2009). \n\nGiven the ventrolateral SN selective degeneration associated with PD, we posit that a relative sparing of the limbic-mSN in the context of DRT drives impulsive, reward-seeking behavior in PD patients with severe impulsivity. Using previously identified SN-subsegment network connectivity profiles to develop classification targets, we first performed target-based segmentation of the SN in PD patients with and without a history of severe impulsivity (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017). We then compared the relative strength of connectivity between the SN and the limbic, associative, and motor network targets, as measured by probabilistic tractography. Our hypothesis was that the connectivity between the mSN and limbic targets would show relative sparing compared to non-limbic-mSN networks in PD patients with a recent history of severe impulsivity. \n\n Methodology  \n\n Subject Selection  \n\nData for these analyses were retrospectively selected from consecutive PD patients who received 3T MRI with 64 direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences as part of the UCLA deep brain stimulation program through January of 2013. All PD patients were diagnosed by Movement Disorder Society Criteria (Postuma et\u00a0al., 2015). Of 163 patients in this group, 142 had complete, accessible imaging. These patients\u2019 medical records were reviewed for the presence of any ICDs or severe impulsivity. One author (HS) reviewed detailed pre-operative neuropsychological evaluation notes in addition to multiple years of neurological progress notes documenting adverse effects of medication. Patients were included if ICD was explicitly diagnosed in the EMR or if subjects were severely impulsive according to study criteria which were derived from modification of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease (QUIP), Section 1, relating to compulsive gambling, buying, sexual, and eating behaviors (Weintraub et\u00a0al., 2009). Our criteria required evidence that impulsivity symptoms interfered with financial, personal, family, and/or professional life, and that it could be reasonably inferred that any 1 of 5 QUIP criteria for gambling, sexual, and buying behaviors, or any 2 of 5 QUIP criteria for eating behaviors, was positive. Some example inferences include:   \nQUIP A1 \u2013 Do you or others think you have an issue with ICD?   \nexample: dopaminergic medication regimen was modified or discontinued by patient or physician explicitly due to impulsive-compulsive behavior \n  \nexample from progress notes: \u201cHe reports dopamine agonist side effects, which is [sic] still present, including impulsivity when shopping, losing a lot of money gambling, and sexual compulsions including viewing a lot of pornography. He had attempted to taper himself off the dopamine agonist, but felt very unwell and off when he tried to do so\u201d \n  \n  \nQUIP A2 \u2013 Do you think too much about the behaviors? No patient screened positive by this criterion. \n  \nQUIP A3 \u2013 Do you have urges or desires for behaviors that you feel are excessive or distressing?   \nexample from progress notes: \u201cHe comes in today with his current girlfriend. He has been very embarrassed about the [sexual] ICD and feels that it has been effecting his relationship with his girlfriend.\u201d \n  \n  \nQUIP A4 \u2013 Do you have difficulty controlling ICD behaviors?   \nexample from progress notes: \u201c[buying] to the point that his family has now removed all of his access to finances (e.g., daughter took away his credit cards).\u201d \n  \n  \nQUIP A5 \u2013 Do you engage in activities (hiding, lying, borrowing, accumulating debt) to continue ICD behaviors?   \nexample from progress notes: \u201cOf note, son at bedside has noted that he has been gambling without telling the family.\u201d \n  \n  \n\nBy these standards, 16 PD patients were determined to suffer from severe impulsivity, hereafter referred to as PD-impulsive group. Only those individuals with MRIs obtained within 2 years of symptomatic impulsivity period were included. \n\nFollowing selection of PD-impulsive group, the same database records were retrospectively reviewed for control PD patient selection. Prior to imaging analysis, control subjects were consecutively selected to subjectively match the list of PD-impulsive subjects by age at MRI, age of PD onset, disease duration, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III)-off medications, years of education, and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). LEDD (as the sum of levodopa and dopamine agonist doses) was calculated according to the formula described by Tomlinson and colleagues (Tomlinson et\u00a0al., 2010). Control subjects were excluded if there was a history of alcohol or other substance abuse. \n\nWe excluded any individuals who had a history of impulsivity that did not meet inclusion criteria, including mild/unimpairing impulsivity, punding, hobbyism, or dopamine dysregulation syndrome. All subjects screened negative for dementia, as part of pre-operative criteria for DBS. MRI images were screened by neuroradiologists and one author (HS) for focal changes including tumors, white matter FLAIR changes, or areas of encephalomalacia. All PD patients had been under stable dopaminergic therapy for at least two months at time of MRI. \n\nWe selected 16 PD patients without impulsivity to compose our PD-control group. After thePD-control group was confirmed to match the PD-impulsive group for possible confounding clinical variables, no additional subjects were added to either group. All 32 patients underwent the following imaging analysis pipeline. One subject in the PD-control group failed cortical reconstruction, and was replaced by a well matched PD-control subject prior to group level analysis. \n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board at UCLA. \n\n Imaging  \n\nEach subject underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging, including high resolution T1-weighted anatomical images (TR 11 ms, TE 2.81 ms, flip angle 20\u00b0, 0.9375 mm isotropic voxels, and 192 slices) and single shot spin echo planar imaging for diffusion tensor imaging (TR 9200 ms, TE 87 ms, 2 mm isotropic voxels, b value=1000, and 64 directions). \n\n Seed and Target Masks  \n\nFreeSurfer (version 5.3.0,  ) was used for cortical surface reconstruction and volumetric segmentation (Dale, Fischl, & Sereno, 1999; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999). Cortical and subcortical labels were applied to subjects\u2019 native brains by using the Brainnetome Atlas Gaussian Classifier Surface (GCS) and Atlas (GCA) developed by Fan   et al   (available at  ) in the Freesurfer pipeline (Fan et\u00a0al., 2016). These labels were combined into conglomerate target masks representing the networks associated with SN connectivity. The groupings for these target masks were derived from an SN-parcellation study at the Montreal Neurological Institute that reported the relative probability of connectivity between functional SN subsegments and individual cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs) in the Brainnetome atlas (Zhang   et al  , Supplemental Figure 5-1)(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017). In this study, Brainnetome ROIs were assigned to a respective network (i.e. limbic, associative, or motor) based on a winner take all approach. Lists of constituent ROIs for each network classification target mask are displayed in  .   \nAssociative, limbic, and sensorimotor network representative classification target masks with constituent   Brainnetome atlas   regions of interest. \n  Table 1   \n\nA mask of the SN was generated from a 7T MRI atlas of basal ganglia based on high-resolution MPRAGE and FLASH scans (Keuken and Forstmann, 2015. available at  ),(Keuken & Forstmann, 2015). The entire region of the SN was extracted from the probabilistic atlas with a threshold of 33%, which is the same threshold that was used by Zhang   et al   (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017) to perform cluster segmentation of the SN. As our methods for segmentation rely on the classification targets derived from the Zhang   et al   analysis, alternative SN mask thresholds were not trialed. \n\nThe network-representative target masks and SN mask were registered to native patient DTI space using FSL. The MNI152 template and high resolution T1 images were first registered to native DTI space using a linear transformation (using mutual information as cost function, 6 degrees of freedom for DTI to T1 registration and 12 degrees of freedom for registration to MNI152). A nonlinear transformation was then applied to the MNI template and the appropriate transformation matrices were applied to each mask (Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002). An example of appropriate transformation for single-subject SN and target masks is shown in  .   \nSingle subject substantia nigra seed, white. Three network representative classification target masks include: limbic, red; associative, blue; and sensorimotor, yellow. \n  Figure 1   \n\n Probabilistic Tractography  \n\nProbabilistic diffusion tractography was performed to measure structural connectivity between the SN and the three network-representative target masks using the FMRIB's Diffusion toolbox (FDT). Eddy current correction was used to apply affine registrations to each volume in the diffusion dataset to register it with the initial reference B0 volume prior to performing tractography. Skull stripping was performed using the FMRIB brain extraction tool (BET), (Smith, 2002). A multi-fiber diffusion model in FDT was fitted to the data. This model uses Bayesian techniques to estimate a probability distribution function (PDF) on the principal fiber direction at each voxel, accounting for the possibility of crossing fibers within each voxel (Behrens, Berg, Jbabdi, Rushworth, & Woolrich, 2007). Two fibers were modeled per voxel, a multiplicative factor (i.e., weight) of 1 for the prior on the additional modeled fibers, and 1000 iterations before sampling (Behrens et\u00a0al., 2007). Using these PDFs and PROBTRACKX, we could then determine the probability of connectivity between SN and each classification target mask. Analysis was performed on split hemispheres. From each voxel in the SN, 5000 streamlines were generated; the FSL default 0.2 curvature threshold was used, a loop check termination was used, and the target masks were used as classification masks. Probabilistic tractography methods were previously described by Tsolaki   et al  (Tsolaki, Downes, Speier, Elias, & Pouratian, 2018). \n\n Threshold Determination  \n\nIn order to prevent excessive censoring of single subjects with low probability of connectivity and to ensure that all subjects were contributing to grouped statistics, the probability of connectivity between each subject's seed-voxel and network-representative target mask was normalized by subject hemisphere-specific maximum probability of connectivity (e.g. if the range of voxel-wise probabilities of SN to limbic target connectivity was 0.01\u2013 0.6, then all probabilities were divided by 0.6 and reported as a percent of maximum probability of connectivity)(Tsolaki et\u00a0al., 2018). For each patient, we used the voxel-wise percent of maximum probability of connectivity to compute voxel-wise percentiles within each hemisphere. These percentiles were plotted against the percent of maximum connectivity to limbic targets in order to visualize potential thresholds ( A). There appeared to be two populations of voxels within each subject specific SN mask, where on average, roughly 50% of all voxels within a SN mask demonstrate <25% of the maximum probability connectivity to limbic targets, whereas the remaining 50% demonstrated a relatively broad range of 25%-100% of maximal connectivity. Thus, an arbitrary threshold of 25% of maximal connectivity was applied to each respective probabilistic seed mask. Visual inspection of similar distributions for associative-vSN and motor-lSN connectivity analyses did not reveal an intuitive point for thresholding, thus the same threshold of 25% of maximal connectivity to respective targets were applied. These distributions are plotted in  B and  C.   \nScatter plot of connectivity percentile amongst voxels in a single subject SN versus percent of maximum connectivity for each SN voxel to   A)   limbic,   B)   associative,   C)   sensorimotor targets. Red solid line shows average percentile at each percent of maximum value across all subjects. Blue dashed line shows the initial 25% of maximum probability of connectivity threshold applied to all SN masks. Green dashed line shows alternative thresholds selected for robustness testing. \n  Figure 2   \n\n Statistical Analysis  \n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that relative SN subsegment degeneration relates to impulsivity in PD, two planned comparisons were initially made. The ratio of connectivity probabilities between of limbic-mSN relative to mean motor-lSN and associative-vSN were compared across groups. The limbic-mSN subsegment volumes relative to mean motor-lSN and associative-vSN volumes were compared across groups. \n\nFollowing a priori testing, three post-hoc analyses were performed: comparison of absolute limbic-mSN connectivity probability across groups; comparison of limbic-mSN relative to motor-lSN connectivity; and comparison of limbic-mSN relative to associative-vSN connectivity. \n\nTo explore connectivity and volume comparisons between the PD-impulsive and PD-control groups, t-tests were performed with hemispheric data. The threshold value for the significance of group differences was p<0.05 for two planned analyses (p<0.025 after Bonferonni correction) and p<0.01 for three additional post-hoc analyses. To further account for the inter-dependence of within subject measurements and to control for LEDD, a multivariate linear mixed effect regression model was created to relate connectivity to impulsivity, modeling LEDD as fixed effects and subject as random effects. \n\nTo confirm the robustness of significant results over multiple thresholds, sensitivity analysis was performed by taking the area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic curves at multiple thresholds (shown as vertical lines in  A). The use of confirmatory models or different connectivity thresholds for robustness testing were not considered unique comparisons requiring correction, as the tested hypotheses and data were unchanged. \n\nAll statistical tests were performed with R (RStudio Team (2015).

A probabilistic map for a single subject is demonstrated in  A-C. Individual seed voxel-wise probability of target connectivity was averaged across individuals within each group. For visualization purposes, these average maps were binarized at 25%, 50%, and 75%, and projected onto a 3-dimensional Standard MNI 152 brain ( ). SN subregions are consistent with the expected results from prior work: voxels in the dorsomedial SN demonstrated the highest probability of connectivity to limbic targets; dorsolateral SN demonstrated the highest probability of connectivity to sensorimotor targets; and ventral SN demonstrated the highest connectivity to associative targets (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017). We evaluated different probability thresholds to ensure that selection of threshold did not bias or affect results. Different probability thresholds do not change the organizational pattern, but only enlarge or shrink the coverage of overlapping functional subsegments.   \nSingle subject tomographic probability maps representing probability of connectivity within each voxel of the SN and   A)   limbic target   B)   associative/executive target   C)   sensorimotor target. \n  Figure 3     \n A)   Superior-inferior   B)   anterior-posterior view of group averaged probabilistic SN connectivity maps thresholded and binarized at 25%, 50%, and 75% probability of connectivity to respective targets and projected in front of a 3-dimensional Standard MNI 152 brain.

This result was robust across multiple tested thresholds ( ). When tested in a multivariate mixed regression model which controlled for both LEDD and within subject measures, impulsivity correlated with greater relative connectivity across multiple thresholds ( ). An example of summary statistics for this model at 25% percent of maximum probability of connectivity is shown in  .

Additionally, there was a trend toward greater limbic-mSN connectivity relative to individual motor-lSN or associative-vSN subsegments, depending on selected thresholds ( D,  E and  ). All post-hoc trends were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons.   \nPost-hoc comparisons of absolute limbic connectivity, limbic-medial SN connectivity relative to motor-lateral SN, and limbic-medial SN connectivity relative to associative-ventral SN. Results are shown across multiple thresholds. \n  Table 5     \n\n Discussion  \n\n Relative Probability of Connectivity  \n\nPD patients with a recent history of severe impulsivity demonstrate significantly greater probability of connectivity between the SN and limbic network targets relative to motor and prefrontal network compared to PD patients without impulsivity. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that differential degeneration across SN-associated dopaminergic networks determines the impulsivity phenotype (De Micco et\u00a0al., 2018; Joutsa et\u00a0al., 2012; H. B. Yoo et\u00a0al., 2015). This also fits with the model that while DRT partially restores the normal functioning within the nigrostriatal network (improving motor symptoms), the dopaminergic treatment may overload the mesolimbic network, potentially triggering affective disturbances and impulsivity (Cools, de Pauw, & Vanderheyden, 2011; De Micco et\u00a0al., 2018; Wise, 2009). \n\nThese findings are consistent with prior reports of PD patients with ICDs demonstrating marked decreases in ventrostriatal and unchanged dorsostriatal DA-receptor expression at baseline (Payer et\u00a0al., 2015). Other studies have confirmed increased ventrostriatal - but not dorsostriatal - DA release in response to reward cues amongst PD patients with ICDs (O'Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2011; Steeves et\u00a0al., 2009). Furthermore, experimental PD models have shown an increase in DA levels in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum following selective nigrostriatal (motor) DA denervation (Houeto et\u00a0al., 2016; van Oosten, Verheij, & Cools, 2005). These findings, of a diminished ventrostriatal DA receptor level and an increase in mesolimbic DA tone, are both hallmark features of a high impulsivity trait in humans and rats, and may explain the increased propensity to develop impulsive behaviors in PD (Besson et\u00a0al., 2013; Buckholtz et\u00a0al., 2010; Dalley et\u00a0al., 2007; Diergaarde et\u00a0al., 2008). Multiple additional multimodal neuroimaging studies have corroborated the relative preservation of limbic networks and related nodes amongst impulsive rather than non-impulsive PD patients\u2014including mPFC, OFC, amygdala, and habenula\u2014although some of these reported changes have been inconsistent (Cerasa et\u00a0al., 2014; Claassen et\u00a0al., 2017; Loane et\u00a0al., 2015; Markovic et\u00a0al., 2017; Tessitore et\u00a0al., 2017; Tessitore et\u00a0al., 2016). The hyperdopaminergic hypothesis is further supported by the mixed linear regression model which suggested a trend toward SN connectivity as a function of the interaction between impulsivity and LEDD. Specifically, at low LEDD the impulsivity phenotype is strongly associated with larger relative mesolimbic connectivity. This suggests that individuals with impulsivity at lower LEDD demonstrte mesolimbic intactness and sensitivity to dopaminergic medication. Whereas at high LEDD, relative connectivity of the mesolimbic network does not select for the impulsivity. To that end, we predict that there is some LEDD at which most PD patients will display some level of impulsivity regardless of relative SN connectivity. Within the tested group, the selective appearance of impulsivity at higher ranges of LEDD may due to some other network dysfunction. For example, a series of studies have also identified a \u201cfrontal-striatal dysconnectivity syndrome\u201d in which reductions in connectivity between striatum and frontal regions, most prominently anterior cingulate cortex (an inhibitory region connected to the mesolimbic network) are associated with impulsivity in PD (Cilia et\u00a0al., 2011; Hammes et\u00a0al., 2019; Premi et\u00a0al., 2016). It may be that limbic connectivity changes are non-uniform across the network and additional multimodal studies at a nodal level are warranted to clarify these complexities in the context of ICDs. \n\nOne potential mechanism for frontal-striatal dysfunction may result from tonic overloading of networks with D2/D3 receptor agonists (e.g., pramipexole and ropinirole). This is thought to suppress reward-related learning by attenuating the effects of negative feedback on phasic dopamine release, thereby encouraging compulsive, perseverative behavior through a direct D1 receptor pathway. That is, excessive striatal D2/D3 agonism diminishes inhibitory control by PFC and other nodes in the executive network (Goto & Grace, 2008; Rokosik & Napier, 2012). Of interest, we found a trend toward degeneration of associative-vSN connectivity as compared to limbic-mSN connectivity. Relative degeneration of associative network nodes has also been implicated in the development of impulsivity in multiple prior imaging studies (Biundo et\u00a0al., 2015; Markovic et\u00a0al., 2017; Ruitenberg et\u00a0al., 2018; Tessitore et\u00a0al., 2017; H. S. Yoo et\u00a0al., 2015). \n\nAn alternate theory to the \u201coverload\u201d hypothesis suggests that impulsivity in PD is associated with decreased dopamine synthesis and storage in the ventral striatum paired with constitutionally decreased or degenerated fronto-striatal connectivity. In this model, metabolic imaging studies finding decreased DAT or D2 receptor availability (e.g. Cilia 2011, Steeves 2009) are interpreted as reflecting decreased dopaminergic neuron density. This hypodopaminergic theory is supported by Hammes   et al   2019, a study which found decreased F-DOPA signal in the nucleus accumbens of PD patients with impulsivity, similar to non-PD addictive phenotypes (Hammes et\u00a0al., 2019; Majuri & Joutsa, 2019). Functional imaging studies have also found decreased activity in the ventral striatum at rest and in response to risk taking tasks(Rao et\u00a0al., 2010; Voon et\u00a0al., 2011). In this context, decreased dopamine signaling paired with fronto-striatal dysconnectivity (as discussed above) is thought to underly the impulsivity phenotype (Hammes 2019, Cilia 2011)(Cilia et\u00a0al., 2011; Hammes et\u00a0al., 2019). Increased connectivity of the SN (as shown in this report) to a dysfunctional limbic network may exacerbate increased impulsivity among PD patients with these traits. However, our study was not designed to definitively differentiate between the hypo- and hyper-dopaminergic models. In particular, connectivity was not analyzed between multiple nodes in each network which might elucidate structural connectivity changes underlying a fronto-striatal dysconnectivity syndrome, but rather between SN and composite target masks intended to capture overall network status. \n\nRather than serving as an etiology of impulsivity, it is also possible that the differential pattern of SN connectivity in the impulsive PD group may have been caused by the development of impulsive behavior. That is, frequent execution of uncontrolled behaviors in PD patients with increased impulsivity may result in a modification of tissue integrity, contributing to greater neurotransmission between regions. These changes may be represented on imaging by stronger fractional anisotropy or directionality of neuronal fibers. The pathological tendency to repeat impulsive behaviors not only creates signal overflow but may theoretically remodel related structures and white matter pathways (H. B. Yoo et\u00a0al., 2015). Based on the current analyses, one cannot determine whether these findings reflect the effect of chronic dopaminergic treatment or represent a neural pattern predisposing to impulsivity (Voon et\u00a0al., 2017). \n\n Relative Volumes  \n\nOur results demonstrate that fine-grained, atlas-derived classification targets may be used in PD to parcellate and classify functionally distinct subsegments of the SN, with the apparent preservation of previously reported topographical limbic-mSN, prefrontal-vSN, and sensorimotor-lSN orientation (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017). In the context of a relatively preserved limbic-mSN dopaminergic network\u2014and with knowledge that PD-associated progressive neuronal degeneration initially occurs in ventrolateral rather than medial SN\u2014we expected to observe relative volumetric subsegment differences across groups (Fearnley & Lees, 1991). Contrary to our hypothesis, these differences were not observed. Nonetheless, this is the first report which uses DTI to assert the in-vivo functional topographical organization of the SN in PD. Moreover, despite the absence of volumetric changes, we provide evidence for the relative segmental degeneration of ventrolateral SN areas as assessed by probabilistic connectivity differences. \n\n Limitations  \n\nThe classification target masks were determined based on a previous study's subsegment connectivity profiles using a \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d approach which assigns each brain area to only one network (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017). In reality, there are overlapping functional regions within the SN and most target masks connect to multiple SN subdivisions to some degree. Furthermore, previous parcellations did not account for white matter tracts that travel within the SN before leaving the seed area. Our finding that the limbic mask shows the strongest connection to the mSN could be partially explained by the fact that a majority of fibers from the lSN travel medially, before turning dorsally toward the striatum. Thus, using tractography to interpret the relative degradation of particular subdivisions of the SN has intrinsic limitations. Nonetheless, the present research represents an exploratory study, with any significant results representing intriguing targets for further work rather than a definitive statement on SN connectivity in PD. \n\nAdditionally, our hypothesis is partially predicated upon the dynamic nature of network degeneration in PD; that is, there may be a time-dependent relative degeneration of motor-lateral and associative-ventral SN compared to the limbic-medial SN. Thus, the cross-sectional nature of our clinical data is an inherent limitation to this study. As such, we assume some time window following ventrolateral degeneration \u2013 but prior to medial degeneration \u2013where impulsive behavior is most correlated to structural connectivity measures in SN-associated networks. This hypothesis has never been previously investigated, as it would require prospective testing with serial DTI scans preceding and following impulsive periods. To ensure that we were indeed capturing structural connectivity measurements relating to impulsivity, we excluded subjects with symptom resolution greater than 2 years prior to scanning. Given that our data was sourced from pre-operative DBS planning scans, most patients were necessarily mildly impulsive or asymptomatic at the time of surgical planning, due to surgeon preference. Thus, there remains a possibility that the structural connectivity findings reported in this study were unrelated to the patient's history of impulsivity or were stochastic. \n\nThis study is also limited by the available clinical data from our institution. The sample size of 16 per group introduces both the possibility that these results would not be generalizable to a larger population and increases the likelihood of type 2 error. Additionally, the cohort included in this report are patients seen for surgical planning for DBS, and may not be representative of a general PD sample. Finally, for a select subset of patients without a formal explicit diagnosis of ICD, patient selection was performed using QUIP criteria retrospectively administered using provider progress notes. Although the authors felt that this method of patient selection was well-defined, this is not the intended method for which the QUIP was developed. When administered directly to the patient, the QUIP, section 1, has >89% specificity for true ICD (Weintraub et\u00a0al., 2009). Without additional data it is impossible to ascertain the specificity of the QUIP when administered in this retrospective manner, and therefore it cannot be determined if patients had true ICDs, although some pathological degree of impulsivity at the time of the written progress note is evident. Again, this study was intended to explore differences between impulsive and non-impulsive PD patients, rather than serve as a method for diagnostic validation. Along these lines, punding, hobbyism, and dopamine dysregulation syndrome were not included, as retrospectively assessing pathological limits was challenging and inconsistent. Indeed, the increased drive or motivation to perform certain behaviors may be beneficial rather than harmful (Gatto & Aldinio, 2019; Weintraub et\u00a0al., 2015). \n\n Conclusions  \n\nWe use network-representative target masks to parcellate and classify functionally distinct subsegments of the SN in PD patients, with the apparent preservation of previously reported topographical limbic-mSN, prefrontal-vSN, and sensorimotor-lSN anatomic subdivisions. Amongst these subsegments, the relatively preserved connectivity of limbic-mSN compared to associative-vSN and motor-lSN networks contributes to a growing body of evidence that relative, as opposed to absolute, degeneration amongst SN associated dopaminergic networks determines the impulsivity phenotype. The structural differences identified in this study are associated with susceptibility of PD patients to impulse control behaviors in response to DRT; however, it remains to be elucidated whether these represent a pre\u2010existing biological predisposition or might occur as a result of dopaminergic medications and/or compulsive behaviors modulating the neurobiology of PD. Understanding neural correlates and potential predisposing factors of these severe behavioral symptoms will be crucial to guide clinical practice and to foster preventive strategies in the future. \n\n Funding  \n\nThis work was partially supported by the Dean's Leadership in Health and Science Scholarship at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

All patients underwent MR examination with conventional MRI scan sequences and an additional DKI sequence. We subsequently reconstructed the DKI raw images and analyzed the data. A radiologist in our hospital collected the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of all subjects. \n\n Results:   In the PD group, the mean kurtosis and axial kurtosis level decreased in the red nucleus (RN) and thalamus; the radial kurtosis increased in the substantia nigra (SN) and globus pallidus (GP). Fractional anisotropy decreased in the putamen. The largest area under the ROC curve of mean diffusion in GP was 0.811. Most kurtosis parameters demonstrated a positive correlation with the MMSE score, while several diffusion parameters showed a negative correlation with the same. \n\n Conclusion:   DKI can qualitatively distinguish PD from healthy controls; furthermore, DKI-derived parameters can quantitatively evaluate the modifications of microstructures in extrapyramidal system gray matter nucleus in PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Clinical diagnosis of PD is based on motor symptoms and signs including rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, and several variations of clinical scales. However, these symptoms are not particularly exclusive to PD, considering the fact that a number of other diseases have similar symptoms or atypical parkinsonian disorders. Due to this, the early diagnosis of PD is particularly difficult in clinical settings. This issue can be addressed by radiologists, by exploring the structural and functional changes in the brain of PD patients via various MR protocols. A previous study reported that neurons projecting from lateral nigra to posterior dorsal putamen were most severely affected by Lewy body pathology in PD ( ). Volumetric analysis of basal ganglia nuclei and SN in patients with PD revealed tissue atrophy at the cortical, basal ganglia, and brainstem (particularly the SN and red nucleus, RN) levels ( ); furthermore, the motor nerve conduction among these were divided into the pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems. Pathophysiology and pathology of PD demonstrated that the diminution of the brainstem is attributed to the neurotic breakdown and necrosis in SN, which indicated the existence of microstructural changes inside the nucleus. Pathological studies also reported the presence of neurotic changes at levels of the cortex and basal ganglia ( ). We hypothesized that there must be a connection inside the nuclei of the extrapyramidal system. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) offers improved sensitivity to tissue microstructure ( ), which may be considered as an advantage over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ). The basal ganglia and brainstem can be visualized in the DKI images ( ). We aimed to investigate microstructural changes of extrapyramidal system nuclei in PD patients and its association with the disease progression, and to explore the connection of nuclei exchange between the levels of the basal ganglia and brainstem. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThe prospective study was approved by local ethics committee, and each participant provided written consent. We enrolled 35 clinical diagnosed PD patients hospitalized in our hospital, along with 23 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). PD was diagnosed based on the criteria provided by UK Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank. The criteria also included the absolute exclusion criteria of PD, resulting in the exclusion of patients with hypertension and diabetes. The exclusion criteria for those in the HC group were history of surgery, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. The demographic and clinical data of the two groups are presented in  . All patients and HC were right-handed. We assessed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of all subjects; the MMSE score of all HC was above 27. Moreover, subjects with none or mild T2WI or T2 FLAIR high signal (Fazekas, grade 1) were considered normal. All subjects had no trauma, tumor, or a history of surgeries involving the central nervous system. \n  \nClinical data of PD and HC groups. \n  \n All patients had been treated with dopamine agonists  . \n  \n\n### Images \n  \nEach subject underwent a GE Revolution CT scan of whole brain to exclude physiological or pathological calcification. All subjects underwent MR examination on a GE Signa HDxT 3.0 T MR scanner with a dedicated eight-channel head coil. The protocols included routine axial T1-, T2-, and diffusion kurtosis weighted images. DKI was obtained using an echo-planar imaging technique with   b   values of 0, 1,000, and 2,000 s/mm  in 15 directions. Parameters of each protocol are described in  . Scan baseline was parallel to the line running through the anterior commissure and the posterior commissure. Scan area ranged from the foramen magnum to the cranial vault. \n  \nMRI protocol parameters. \n  \n\n### DKI Interpretation \n  \n#### Quantitative Assessment \n  \nInitial DKI images of all subjects were reconstructed on ADW4.4 workstation with Functool 2 software using all   b   values. The reconstructive images included mean kurtosis image (MK), axial kurtosis image (Ka), radial kurtosis image (Kr), mean diffusivity image (MD), axial diffusivity image (Da), radial diffusivity image (Dr), and fractional anisotropy image (FA), and the parameters were recorded as MK, Ka, Kr, MD, Da, Dr, and FA, respectively ( ). Small round region of interest (ROI) was drawn with a diameter of 3 mm at the center of the maximum level of target nucleus ( ), which included RN, SN, thalamus (T), putamen (P), globus pallidus (GP), and the head of caudate nuclei (HCN). The ROIs were manually drawn by two neuroradiologists in the same manner. To improve intra-observer reliability, the neuroradiologists performed the same measurements for all subjects three times and average the results. To evaluate interobserver reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic variables and MMSE scores were compared using two-tailed   t   tests and chi-squared tests. ICC test was calculated to evaluate interobserver reliability prior to data analysis. The consequent analysis would be performed if ICC test returned a consistent result (i.e., ICC \u2265 0.75). The diffusion and kurtosis parameters of right and left deep gray matter structures were compared using two-sided Satterthwaite   T   test. Two independent-samples   T   tests or two-sample Mann\u2013Whitney   U   tests were used to compare the parameters of six nuclei between two groups. We performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test to assess the ability of distinguishing two groups for each DKI parameter of every nucleus. The correlations between DKI parameters and MMSE score were tested using Spearman's correlation test. All measurement data were presented as mean value and standard deviation.   P   <0.05 was set to be statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical Data \n  \nThere were no observed significant differences between patient's age (  t   = 0.284,   P   = 0.777) and sex (\u03c7  = 0.069,   P   = 0.793) between the two groups. However, there was a significant intergroup difference in the MMSE score (  t   = 7.807,   P   = 0.000). \n\n\n### DKI Data \n  \nThe ICC values of all ROIs were >0.75 (shown in  ). The results did not show any lateral difference in any of MK, Ka, Kr, MD, Da, Dr, and FA of each nucleus for all subjects (  P   > 0.05).

A previous report revealed that DKI was highly sensitive to microstructural changes in tissue, which is not typically highlighted by the diffusion coefficient value ( ). We observed statistical differences of DKI parameters between PD patients and HC, among which MD of GP was the best biomarker for diagnosis. It is well-recognized that DKI is sensitive to capture the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of tissue microstructure; thus, it has already been extensively used to probe microstructural changes in normal aging. The FA and MK of frontal lobe, temporal lobe, corpus callosum (knee and splenium), thalamus, posterior limb of internal capsule, and head of the caudate nucleus decreased with aging; however, there was an increase in the MD levels ( ,  ). Another study by Latt, which focused on healthy adults across different age groups, observed that MK of thalamus, white matter of frontal lobe, knee of corpus callosum, and centrum semiovale were negatively linearly correlated with aging ( ). Overall, a pattern of increased MD and radial and axial diffusivity, together with decreased FA, MK, and radial and axial kurtosis in GM, was found in normal aging ( \u2013 ). These age-related alterations may possibly be driven by mixed effects of axonal disintegration, cell loss, and iron accumulation. In our research, MD, Da, and Dr in some deep GM of PD group appeared to be higher than that of the HC group. However, a specific pattern of increased Kr in SN and GP was found in PD, which has the highest iron concentration in the brain in PD ( ). Therefore, one probable interpretation of our result is excessive deposition of iron, neuronal degeneration, and apoptosis in SN and GP in PD patients, especially along the \u201cradial\u201d direction. We speculate that the alterations in diffusion metrics in PD may reflect both iron-related and age-related microstructure changes, with a leading factor by the former. This idea is supported by earlier research about effect of cocaine addiction and age on the microstructure of striatum and thalamus using DKI ( ). Pathological studies of PD patients suggested that microstructural changes occur from brainstem at an early stage and subsequently spread to the limbic system and the cortices ( ,  ). Therefore, the goal of this present study was to assess the microstructural changes in extrapyramidal system and to elucidate its associations. \n\n### Diffusion and Kurtosis Parameters \n  \nHere, three diffusion parameters of the PD group appeared to be higher than that of the HC group. Studies have reported the presence of heterogeneous pathological encephalatrophy of brain in PD patients; additionally, the earliest onset was demonstrated in the SN and was considered as the most vulnerable structure ( ). It was proposed that the dilated intercellular space caused by neuronal degeneration and apoptosis could enhance water molecule movement. Furthermore, the remaining areas of gray matter in PD patients may also experience a similar degree of modification. Damage in the neurons of the brainstem will lead to an accumulation of the materials in synapses of the nerve fibers transporting nutrients from cerebrum downward to the brainstem, resulting in the deficiency of nutritious materials in fibers from the brainstem downward to the spine. Both consequences will lead to secondary damage to adjacent structures and increase membrane permeability to facilitate the diffusion of water molecules. \n\nDiffusion kurtosis parameters were associated with the complexity of structures, which varied across the diverse brain structures in healthy adults. The observed decline in the diffusion kurtosis parameters and FA may be due to neuronal degeneration and apoptosis combined with secondary damage of adjacent structures. Microglial cells are the most significant immune cells of brain. They distribute heterogeneously in brain, with their highest intensity being in the SN. In the resting (physiological) state, microglial cells provide a certain extent of protection to the central nervous system. While in the activated (pathological) state, they may cause damage to central nervous system by secreting varieties of interleukins and cytokines that are closely related to inflammatory reactions and neuronal repair ( ,  ). The pathological examination of PD demonstrated a large number of activated microglial cells in the SN, with an even higher intensity in the areas of neuronal degeneration ( ,  ). In addition to neuronal damage in the brain of PD patients, the formation of Lewy body, accumulation of microglial cells, and repair of neurons enhanced the complexity of tissue structures and resulted in the increase of diffusion kurtosis parameters. Here, PD patients were not categorized into subtypes according to an early or late clinical period or in consideration of shorter or longer disease duration. The decrease observed in MK, Ka, and FA of deep GM may be attributed to neuronal damage. The increase of Kr in SN and GP may be due to the dominating effect of neuronal repair in the region. \n\nDKI is an extension of DTI, which could reflect microstructural complexity, particularly in isotropic tissues such as gray matter ( ). Some research focused on gray matter seemed more concerned with the overall diffusional metrics of MK, FA, and MD, rather than directional metrics such as axial diffusivity and radial kurtosis. This is because the GM microstructure lacks evident directionality that the radial and axial directions will be random and highly influenced by noise ( ). However, a variety of changed Kr, Dr, Ka, and Kr in GM continue to be reported in normal aging ( \u2013 ,  ), in Moyamoya Disease ( ), in Bipolar Disorders ( ), and in various neurodegenerative processes including Alzheimer's disease ( ,  ) and Parkinson's disease ( ,  ). In fact, some of the deep GMs are composed of both gray matter and white matter ( ,  ). The caudate nucleus includes the associative fibers projecting to the prefrontal cortex. The putamen contains projecting fibers from the primary motor and premotor cortices. Different from the caudate nucleus and putamen, the globus pallidus is rich in long, smooth, and sparsely branched neuronal dendrites that are well-protected by myelin. The red nucleus consists of densely packed cells and small myelinated axons ( ,  ). These findings may suggest that varying proportion of white matter in the deep GM make motion of water restricted and directional. Actually, anisotropic water diffusion depends on oriented barriers. The deep GM is composed primarily of neurons and glia, which also have the highest iron deposits in the brain ( ,  ). The myelinated axons, large cells, and ferritin protein constitute a complex microstructure that imposed extensive hindrance to free diffusion of water molecules. Thus, diffusion metrics in the deep GM appears to be different and more complicated than that in white matter. The degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) is the neuropathologic hallmark of PD ( ). One previous study using the PD mouse model indicates that Dr in the SN is related with the numbers of SN dopaminergic neurons ( ). As interesting findings in directional diffusion metrics were observed in deep GM, we speculate that they are of potential significance in deep GM. However, their underlying pathophysiological meaning should be examined in further studies. In our study, all diffusion parameters including the directional ones were presented to provide a comprehensive view with potentially intriguing findings. \n\n\n### Diagnostic Efficiency of DKI Parameters \n  \nIn our study, ROC analysis revealed that the MD for the globus pallidus had the best diagnostic performance. It is worth noting that, although the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN is the neuropathological hallmark in PD, the diffusion metric for the globus pallidus is the best biomarker to differentiate PD patients from HC. Globus pallidus is the most important relayed nucleus between striatum and subthalamic nuclei (STN) and plays an important role in the integration between inhibition from striatum and excitation from neocortex, thalamus, and STN ( ). Changes in activity of neurotransmitters and related receptors along with abnormal synchronized oscillatory activity in the globus pallidus are associated with PD symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, which reflects that globus pallidus plays an important role in the process of PD ( ,  ). DBS researches have confirmed that stimulation of the globus pallidus is effective in reducing parkinsonian motor signs ( ,  ). Among all the deep gray matter structures, globus pallidus has the relatively complex microstructural compositions and has the highest iron concentration in the brain ( ). In summary, these results suggested that changed MD for the globus pallidus may reflect distinct pathological changes in PD. Future studies are needed to shed more light on the mechanisms underlying the changes in globus pallidus of patients with PD. Diffusivity parameters of RN and SN were useful; however, their sensitivity was not sufficiently high for clinical purposes. Alternatively, the diagnostic confidence was promoted with an accurate final diagnosis, considering that it is possible to employ these diagnostic parameters and that they may be applied in the form of assisted methods. \n\n\n### MMSE Score \n  \nThe correlation between DKI parameters and MMSE in our subjects suggested that the changes in the microstructure detected by DKI corresponded to the psycho-neural state; therefore, further investigation of DKI may benefit PD patients with dementia. As discussed previously, when the neuron repair dominated a particular region, the damage to the central neural system was restrained. This indicated that the psycho-neural state would be better in cases with a higher MMSE score. Diffusivity parameters represent the severity of damage that occurs to the brain, with higher levels indicating greater damage and a lower MMSE score. Therefore, both diffusivity and kurtosis parameters work as independent biomarkers to assess the psycho-neural state of PD patients. It was of great importance to note that the kurtosis parameters correlating with MMSE was focused on GP, RN, and SN, which had the most complicated microstructural compositions ( ). We speculate that microstructural \u201ccomplexity\u201d in GP, RN, and SN may be the basis of psycho-neural state in PD. Meanwhile, negative correlations with MMSE score were observed for axial, radial, and mean diffusivity of the thalamus and HCN in our study. The caudate nucleus and thalamus had a relatively simple microstructure, which were mostly constituted by neurons and glia ( ). The diffusion parameters of these regions likely reflect the distribution of neuron cell bodies, synapses, and dendrites. This may suggest that the integrity of thalamus and HCN had potential correlation with the psycho-neural state in PD. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nDKI can qualitatively distinguish PD from HC; furthermore, DKI-derived parameters can quantitatively evaluate the modifications of microstructures in extrapyramidal system gray matter nucleus in PD. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOne limitation of our study is that the spatial resolution is 1.875 \u00d71.875 \u00d74 mm . This may yield imperfect reference values and is thus biased. Another limitation is that treatment medication is not taken into account, the impact of which may lead to distorted brain structure. This needs to be explored in a future study. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University.

Eighteen percent of the patients presented a postoperative cognitive decline, which was found to be principally related to the surgical procedure. Other factors predictive of poor cognitive outcome were perioperative confusion and psychosis. Nineteen patients showed a stimulation-induced hypomania, which was related to both the form of the disease (younger age, shorter disease duration, higher levodopa responsiveness) and the ventral contact location. Postoperative depression was more frequent in patients already showing preoperative depressive and/or residual axial motor symptoms. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nIn this homogeneous cohort of patients with PD, we showed that (1) the STN is the best target to improve motor symptoms, (2) postoperative cognitive deficit is mainly related to the surgery itself, and (3) stimulation-induced hypomania is related to a combination of both the disease characteristics and a more ventral STN location. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nBilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) has been shown to dramatically alleviate motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).  However, some patients show poor relief of parkinsonian motor disability and/or nonmotor side effects, such as a dysexecutive syndrome  or psychiatric symptoms.  These side effects impair the postsurgery quality of life and are responsible for a poor global outcome.  Because of these postoperative problems, some authors have (re)proposed other targets such as the globus pallidus interna  or the zona incerta (ZI). \n\nSeveral preoperative clinical factors are predictive of some of the postoperative difficulties with DBS-STN: (1) older age, (2) parkinsonism with poor response to dopaminergic treatment,  (3) preoperative cognitive deficit such as executive dysfunction,  or (4) focal brain atrophy.  Ventral location of the STN stimulating contact may provoke transient postsurgical hypomania.  The role of preoperative factors,  surgical procedure,  locations of stimulating contacts,  and postoperative management  on the postoperative motor benefit and side effects has already been independently studied in small cohorts of patients. \n\nOur goal was to delve further in this analysis by closely examining our large and homogeneous single-center cohort of 309 patients with PD who underwent surgery within a 13-year period, evaluating patients before, during, and 1 year after DBS-STN. Specifically, we wished to determine the ideal target within the STN area that showed the greatest improvement and fewest side effects for patients with PD. We were also interested in which clinical and surgical factors might be relevant for the postoperative outcome with DBS-STN. We assessed the link between the specific motor, cognitive, and psychiatric outcomes after surgery and the preoperative PD clinical features, MRI measures, surgical procedure, and locations of stimulating contacts that might help us to define the best target for a given patient. \n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Patients. \n  \nBetween February 1996 and July 2009, 309 patients with PD underwent DBS-STN at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital (Paris, France). Patients were deemed suitable for surgery according to the following criteria : (1) age younger than 70 years (mean age: 54.8 \u00b1 8.8 years, except in 9 patients); (2) a severe form of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage \u22652.5); (3) >40% decrease in motor symptoms with levodopa treatment; and (4) presence of disabling levodopa-induced motor complications despite optimal medical treatment. Exclusion criteria included dementia, ongoing psychiatric disturbances, surgical contraindications, and relevant brain lesions detected on MRI. \n\n\n### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. \n  \nThis study received approval from the local ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study. \n\n\n### Neurosurgical procedure. \n  \nQuadripolar electrodes (model 3389-28; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) were bilaterally implanted, combining intraoperative microelectrode recordings and stimulation, and connected to a subcutaneous pulse generator (Medtronic). Stimulation measures (pulse width, frequency, intensity) were adjusted using an external programmer. \n\n\n### Clinical evaluation. \n  \nEvaluation of patients was performed 3 months before and 1 year after surgery. \n\n#### Parkinsonian motor disability. \n  \nThe activities of daily living (ADL) score (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part II) was assessed by patient interview in the \u201coff\u201d and \u201con\u201d drug conditions. \n\nBefore surgery, the motor disability score (UPDRS part III) was examined in the off condition, after a 12-hour interruption of antiparkinsonian medication, and best on-drug condition (\u201cresidual\u201d score), after the administration of a single suprathreshold dose of levodopa. Four subscores were calculated: (1) tremor, (2) rigidity, (3) akinesia, and (4) axial. After surgery, these scores were evaluated in 4 conditions, the same day and in the same order: (1) on stimulation (with chronic stimulation measures) and off drug; (2) off stimulation and off drug, after stimulation stopped for at least 90 minutes; (3) off stimulation and on drug, after the administration of the suprathreshold dose of levodopa; and (4) on stimulation and on drug. \n\n\n#### Cognitive status. \n  \nNeuropsychological evaluation focused on executive functions, attention, memory, and visuoconstructive abilities,  by using (1) the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) (range: 0\u2013144), with low scores indicating worse cognitive performance ; (2) the \u201cfrontal score,\u201d determined on a 50-point scale, including the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (scale 0\u201320) and verbal fluency ; and (3) the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test to assess memory. \n\n\n#### Psychiatric status. \n  \nDepressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (range: 0\u201360; depression diagnosis: score >13).  Hypomania and major depressive disorder were examined using a behavioral evaluation including both a semistructured psychiatric interview based on   DSM-IV   criteria (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and a nonstandardized psychiatric interview. \n\n\n#### Antiparkinsonian treatment and stimulation parameter settings. \n  \nThe levodopa-equivalent dosage and stimulation measures were also noted. Levodopa-related complications were evaluated using the UPDRS part IV. \n\n\n\n### MRI acquisition and analysis. \n  \nMRI acquisition was performed the day before surgery, with the stereotactic Leksell frame in place, and an MRI or 3-dimensional helical tomodensitometry was performed the following day to visualize electrode tracks and determine contact locations.  A voxel-based morphometric analysis was performed on the preoperative T1 images (with no gadolinium) to quantify changes in the gray and white matter concentration (n = 160 patients). \n\nThe location of electrodes was obtained using a deformable 3-dimensional histologic atlas of the basal ganglia.  Within the STN, 3 functional territories were defined, i.e., posterior-sensorimotor (SM), intermediate-associative (AS), and anterior-limbic parts, by analogy with tract tracing data obtained in monkeys.  The contact coordinates in the normalized atlas space with reference to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure system were measured relative to the posterior commissure point (absolute laterality: X; anteroposteriority: Y; depth: Z). \n   Flowchart of patients evaluated in this study  \nAS = associative; MADRS = Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale; MDRS = Mattis Dementia Rating Scale; PD = Parkinson disease; SM = sensorimotor; STN = subthalamic nucleus; ZI = zona incerta. \n  \n\n### Statistical analysis. \n  \nChanges in scores between baseline and the 1-year follow-up were determined with respect to the same preoperative drug condition. The relationship between the stimulating contact coordinates and the postoperative changes was assessed using a univariate   z   correlation test. The mean coordinates of the stimulating contacts were chosen as cutoff points to further determine the effects of contact coordinates on the postoperative clinical outcome by using Student   t   tests. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The level of significance was set at   p   < 0.01. \n\n#### Motor outcome. \n  \nThe role of contact location in the postoperative outcome between patients with bilateral stimulation of the SM-STN, the AS-STN, or the ZI ( ) was tested using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. \n   Effects of deep brain stimulation on parkinsonian motor disability as a function of stimulating contact location  \n(A) Example of one electrode location reconstructed on the 3-dimensional digitized basal ganglia atlas showing the 4 stimulating contacts (blue cylinder, upper left image). The position of each contact is seen on the axial (upper right), sagittal (lower left), and coronal (lower right) images reconstructed in the electrode plane. The location of the stimulating contact in the sensorimotor (SM, green), associative (AS, pink), or limbic (LI, yellow) parts of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or outside the STN, such as in the substantia nigra (SN, black, located ventrally to the STN), the zona incerta/Forel field area (ZI, yellow, located medially to the STN), or the internal capsule (IC, red, located laterally to the STN), can therefore be accurately determined. (B) Relative distribution of locations of the chronically implanted stimulating contacts in the 262 patients with Parkinson disease, in the left and right hemispheres. (C) Effects of the bilateral stimulation of the SM-STN (green columns) vs AS-STN (pink columns) vs ZI (blue columns) on parkinsonian motor disability (Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] part III), rigidity, akinesia, and axial signs 1 year after surgery (on stimulation, off drug). The first gray column represents the scores before surgery without antiparkinsonian treatment (off drug). Asterisks indicate significant differences between groups. (D) Relationship between the anteroposterior (Y) coordinate of the right stimulating contact and the improvement in motor disability with bilateral stimulation alone (on stimulation, off drug; left graph), reduction in the levodopa replacement therapy (middle graph), and change in levodopa-induced motor complications (right graph), 12 months after surgery. CP = commissure posterior. \n  \n\n#### Cognitive outcome. \n  \nPatients with a preoperative MDRS score <130 were excluded from this part of the study ( ). Postoperative cognitive decline was defined as a decrease more than mean + 1 SD in the MDRS after surgery and/or MDRS score <130. To determine which factors differed between patients with vs without postoperative cognitive decline, we performed Student   t   tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. \n\n\n#### Psychiatric outcome. \n  \nChange in the MADRS score after surgery was the main outcome variable. To determine which factors differed between patients with vs without postoperative depression (MADRS score >13), we performed Student   t   tests for continuous variables and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Pre- and postoperative data obtained in patients with postoperative depression, transient hypomanic status, or no mood disorders were compared using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. See e-Methods on the   Neurology  \u00ae Web site at   for further details of the methods. \n\n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nAmong the 309 patients with PD who underwent bilateral STN stimulation between January 1996 and July 2009, 47 were excluded from the final statistical analysis ( ). After these exclusions, we were able to assess the effects of bilateral stimulation on motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms and the therapeutic contact location from a total of 262 patients with PD (103 women/159 men; mean age: 57.6 \u00b1 8.1 years; mean disease duration: 12.8 \u00b1 5.1 years) ( ,  ). \n  \nUPDRS scores, cognition, depression, and dopaminergic drug treatment \n  \n### Contact locations. \n  \nThe distribution of the stimulating contact locations is shown in  . Our method led to the right and left stimulating contacts being bilaterally located in the posterior-SM-STN in 17 patients, the intermediate-AS-STN in 61 patients, and the ZI in 26 patients ( ). In 158 patients, the 2 stimulating contacts were not bilaterally located in the same subterritory of the STN ( ). \n\n\n### Motor outcome. \n  \nPatients with PD with SM- or AS-STN stimulation showed lower residual parkinsonian motor disability and akinesia scores (on stimulation, off treatment) in comparison to patients with ZI stimulation ( ), with no significant difference in preoperative features among the 3 groups (table e-1). None of the tremor, rigidity, and axial subscores (table e-1,  ), antiparkinsonian drug treatment (table e-1), or parameter settings (not shown) showed significant differences. \n\nThe decrease in parkinsonian motor disability and axial scores and levodopa daily dose under bilateral DBS-STN was significantly related to the right anterior-Y coordinate of the stimulating contact (  p   < 0.01,  ). The change in levodopa-induced motor complications (UPDRS IV) was also significantly related to both the right and left anterior-Y coordinates of the contacts (  p   < 0.01,  ). Patients with PD who had higher Y coordinates (>10.6 mm, right side) vs lower (\u226410.6 mm) showed significantly greater improvements in motor disability and decreases in levodopa-induced motor complications and levodopa daily dose (  p   < 0.01) (figure e-1). \n\n\n### Cognitive outcome. \n  \nThe MDRS score was significantly lower after surgery ( ), with 18% of patients showing a decrease of >6 points (n = 31) and/or an MDRS score <130 (n = 14) ( ). Patients with postoperative cognitive decline showed greater decreases for all of the cognitive domains explored (except the visuoconstructive test) and higher scores for ADL, motor disability, and akinesia scores ( , table e-2). Preoperative clinical features and brain MRI white and gray matter densities (voxel-based morphometry) showed no significant differences between the 2 groups (table e-2). Perioperative confusion and psychosis were more frequent in patients who went on to develop a cognitive decline (24% vs 6%,   p   < 0.001) (table e-3). \n   Postoperative parkinsonian disability and stimulating contact location in PD patients with vs without cognitive decline 1 year after surgery  \n(A) Differences in parkinsonian activities of daily living (UPDRS part II), motor disability (UPDRS part III), and axial motor sign scores with bilateral subthalamic stimulation alone (OFF, solid red bars) or with drug (ON, empty red bars) in patients with PD who had postoperative cognitive decline (left panel) vs cognitive stability (right panel). The first bars (gray) represent the results obtained for the same scores in the off-drug condition before surgery in each group. (B) Location of the stimulating contacts of the patients with PD who had postoperative cognitive decline (left panel, red cylinders) vs cognitive stability (right panel, blue cylinders). The graph represents the relative proportion of stimulating contacts located within the different subthalamic subregions (sensorimotor, associative, and limbic) and surrounding areas (zona incerta/Forel field, internal capsule, substantia nigra pars reticulata). (C) Changes in the mean MDRS score in PD patients with (filled red squares) vs without (black squares) cognitive decline, 1 and 2 years after surgery. Note that in both groups cognitive status did not significantly change between the first and the second year postsurgery. (D) Relationship between the anteroposterior (Y) coordinate of the right stimulating contact and the change in the frontal score (left panel) and category verbal fluency (middle panel), and the depth (Z) of the right stimulating contact and the change in the MDRS score (right panel). Asterisks indicate significant differences between the 2 groups. CP = commissure posterior; MDRS = Mattis Dementia Rating Scale; PD = Parkinson disease; STN = subthalamic nucleus; UPDRS = Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale. \n  \nThe stimulating contacts were located differently in the 2 groups, with a more frequent position within the STN in patients with postoperative cognitive decline, and within the ZI in patients with no decline (for the right side,  ). In patients with cognitive decline vs without, the left stimulating contacts were located more posteriorly and deeper. A significant positive relationship was found between both the left and right anterior-Y coordinates of the stimulating contacts and the changes in the \u201cfrontal,\u201d verbal fluency (category and phonemic), and free-recall scores ( ). Patients with PD who had a higher right Y coordinate (>10.6 mm) vs lower (\u226410.6 mm) had significant higher scores for verbal fluency, with a smaller decrease in the frontal and verbal fluency scores (  p   < 0.01, not shown). The left anterior-Y coordinate was also positively correlated with the changes in the initiation and memory scores (MDRS,   p   < 0.01, not shown) and patients with higher left Y coordinates showed significantly less decrease in the MDRS score after surgery (  p   < 0.01, not shown). The right and left depth (Z) coordinates were also significantly related to the change in the memory-MDRS score ( ), with a smaller decrease in patients with a lower right Z coordinate (not shown). No difference in the stimulation measures was found between groups (not shown). \n\n\n### Psychiatric outcome. \n  \nBefore surgery, 45 patients showed symptoms of depression. The mean MADRS score did not change significantly after surgery ( ). Eighty-four patients showed no postoperative mood disorders, 26 of 45 depressive patients improved their mood status, and 27 developed depression ( ). No significant difference was found between patients who went on to develop or maintain depressive signs after surgery (n = 46) vs patients whose depression improved (n = 26), except for lower pre- and postoperative cognitive scores in depressive patients (  p   < 0.006). No significant difference was found for the parameter settings or contact locations between groups. \n\nNineteen patients presented with transient hypomania in the perioperative period, relieved by modifying stimulation parameter settings and/or medication ( ). This group of patients had (1) younger age, (2) shorter disease duration, and (3) similar severity of parkinsonian motor disability (off treatment) with fewer residual motor signs with dopaminergic drug treatment ( ) and MADRS score (not shown). After surgery, these patients also showed lower ADL (on treatment) and MADRS scores. No significant difference was found for the parameter settings between groups, but the mean coordinates of contacts inducing hypomania were found to be significantly deeper with a more frequent position in the intermediate-AS-STN (53% vs 31%) and the SN (8% vs 1.5%), and less frequently in the ZI (3% vs 13%) (  p   = 0.009,  ). See e-Results for further details of the results. \n   Psychiatric effects of deep brain stimulation in patients with PD as a function of age, disease characteristics, postoperative motor disability improvement, and stimulating electrode locations  \n(A) Differences in age at time of surgery, disease duration, parkinsonian motor disability \u201con\u201d drug before surgery and \u201con\u201d stimulation alone after surgery in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who had postoperative depression (blue bars), hypomanic episodes (red bars), or no mood disorders (black bars). (B) Left panel: stimulating contacts used in patients with PD who had postoperative depression (blue cylinders) or hypomania (brown cylinders); right panel: mean (SD) X, Y, and Z coordinates in the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure space of the stimulating contacts in patients with PD who had postoperative depression or hypomania. Asterisks indicate significant differences between groups. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this large single-center cohort of highly selected patients with PD who underwent bilateral STN-DBS, we showed that (1) the most effective target for the alleviation of PD motor symptoms and levodopa-induced motor complications is the STN and not the surrounding structures, (2) the occurrence of postoperative cognitive decline is mainly related to the surgical procedure, with stimulation sites associated with memory decline being located more ventral, and (3) stimulation-induced hypomania is related to both the form of the disease and deeper contact locations, whereas postoperative depression was only found to be related to preexisting depressive signs and lower cognitive performance. \n\nTo determine whether or not bilateral STN stimulation performed under the \u201cbest\u201d conditions with the best patient candidates might be deleterious, this study was conducted in a large homogeneous population of patients with PD selected using strict inclusion criteria. In consequence, the influence of preoperative features (age, levodopa responsiveness, and preoperative cognitive status) on the postoperative outcome could have been masked, at least in part. The role of the contact locations was examined by using a deformable atlas that provides a 1-mm precision,  and functional STN subdivisions were obtained from track tracings in monkeys.  Recent neurophysiologic and imaging studies performed in healthy subjects and patients with PD suggest that a similar STN functional organization exists (posterior-SM, intermediate-AS, and anterior-limbic).  This objective evaluation of stimulation sites has also been applied by other teams  and in multicenter clinical research protocols.  The electrode locations in our patients were most frequently located within the intermediate-AS part of the STN, with only a small number of bilateral locations in the posterior-SM-STN. This probably results from our presurgical planning that targeted the center of the STN  with a trajectory that provides better intraoperative electrophysiologic recordings and acute clinical effects, especially alleviation of akinesia. \n\nFor such a large population of patients, the effect of DBS-STN on parkinsonian motor symptoms can be considered dramatic as judged by the 64% improvement in motor disability with stimulation alone. Such improvement is greater than that reported by others using less restrictive inclusion criteria.  This argues for the strict selection of patients to obtain the best motor outcome with minimum side effects. \n\nThe effects on parkinsonian disability showed no difference whether stimulation was performed within the posterior-SM or intermediate-AS parts of the STN, with the best motor improvements found with the most anterior electrode locations (closer to the associative part of the STN;  ). This suggests that stimulation of the intermediate-AS part of the STN represents a preferential location to improve parkinsonian motor akinesia.  However, other authors have proposed a more dorsoposterior target within the STN,  where the most powerful \u03b2 oscillatory activity is recorded and correlated with best motor improvement.  This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the following facts: (1) the entire volume of the STN receives afferent projections from the motor cortex via the \u201chyperdirect pathway,\u201d whose activity is modulated by STN stimulation and related to the motor effects of this treatment ; (2) motor and associative territories of the STN are separated by functional gradients,  suggesting that neurons in the central part of the STN may have connections with both SM and AS inputs; and (3) the somatotopic organization of the STN neurons in patients with PD is partly lost.  However, akinesia comprises motor but also cognitive and motivational components, understandably improved by targeting the associative neuronal network. Stimulation of the ZI area gave poorer motor improvement (49%) with no evidence of a specific effect on tremor severity, as previously reported. \n\nChronic stimulation of the associative STN induced no decline in executive functions, in contrast to acute stimulation  or in patients with low cognitive capacity,  and more anterior stimulation (close to the associative STN) was related to an increase in executive function 1 year after surgery. This is in line with anterior positioning of electrodes reported in patients with PD showing no decline in mental status scores after surgery.  Ventral electrode location was found to be associated with memory decline, as previously observed.  However, the fact that patients with PD who had a 1-year postoperative decline showed no further cognitive decline 2 years after surgery ( ) suggests that the main factor related to its occurrence is the surgical procedure creating a microlesion.  Facts supporting this hypothesis are that (1) an acute decline in some executive functions is observed in the days after surgery  or in the absence of STN stimulation,  and (2) similar cognitive side effects exist, whatever the surgical target, i.e., the STN or the globus pallidus interna. \n\nStimulation of the more ventral (limbic) part of the STN induced hypomania, as previously reported in both patients with PD  and patients with psychiatric disorders.  Hypomania was mainly observed in younger patients, those with shorter disease duration, and those with a higher levodopa responsiveness, i.e., a disease profile similar to that observed in patients with dopaminergic dysregulation.  Conversely, postoperative depression was not found to be related to electrode location, but to the presence of a preoperative depression, parkinsonian mental deficit, and axial motor signs, as previously reported. \n\nThe STN, therefore, and not the surrounding areas, appears to be the ideal target to improve motor disability in patients with PD. This technique may provoke memory or emotional disturbances, especially if the electrodes are too ventral in the STN. This confirms the role of the STN in motor and nonmotor processing and its possible importance in nonmotor diseases. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4001189, "text_md5": "66bbe248ea3fbbd9414682ec01ef0dae", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 549], "journal": [550, 559], "publication_year": [561, 565], "title": [576, 666], "keywords": [680, 680], "abstract": [693, 2399], "body": [2408, 27766]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24647024, "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000000315", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4001189", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4001189"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4001189\">4001189</a>", "list_title": "PMC4001189  Optimal target localization for subthalamic stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease"}

Bilateral absent, unilateral absent, and faintly present STS were considered as absent STS and predicted PD or PPS, and bilateral presence was considered as a positive STS, and was assessed keeping the clinical diagnosis as the gold standard.\n \n\n Results  \n\u2003The sensitivity of the absent STS was 75.55%, specificity 97.77%, positive predictive value 97.14%, negative predictive value 80% and accuracy 86.66%, in the diagnosis of PD or PPS, with odd ratio of 132 (confidence interval 15.97\u20131098.75). Kappa coefficient was 0.80 (\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.001) for both inter- and intrarater agreement, suggesting high reproducibility for the detection of STS.\n \n\n Conclusions  \n\u2003Absence of the STS is a good predictor of degeneration of the nigrosome 1 in the substantia nigra in the PD or PPS patients; hence, it can act as a useful marker of these diseases.\n \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Key Messages \n  \nDegeneration of nigrosome 1 in substantia nigra presents as loss of swallow tail sign on high-resolution axial susceptibility-weighted imaging images and can act as a marker of Parkinson's disease. \n\n\n## Introduction \n  \n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder which is progressive in nature. It includes motor symptoms like tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait abnormality, and nonmotor symptoms like dementia, disturbances in eating, swallowing and bladder and bowel control.\n \nTo make the diagnosis of PD in early stages can be challenging. Nigrosome-1 is the largest cluster of dopaminergic neurons present in dorsolateral substantia nigra (SN) which is most affected in PD. It is seen as a hyperintense structure in the otherwise hypointense SN on high-resolution 3D susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence at 3T MRI and hence gives the appearance of swallow tail sign (STS). Degeneration of the nigrosome-1 will appear as absence of the STS; hence, it can be a useful marker of PD.\n \nParkinson plus syndrome (PPS) appears as atypical PD, with additional differences like lack of tremor, eye movement abnormalities, orthostatic hypotension, and lack of response to L-Dopa.\n \n\n\n## Subjects and Methods \n  \nThe study got approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). Informed consent was taken from all participants, according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the IEC-approved proforma. The study was a prospective case\u2013control study, with patients with PD or PPS recruited from the institute's neurology department. The patients were recruited during their disease workup and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans including the SWI sequence were done as part of evaluation. Sample size calculation was done making the assumptions of 90% power, 30% exposure to controls, odd ratio (OR) of 4.5 and confidence interval (CI) of 95%, using the Fleiss method with continuity correction, to yield a total sample size of 90, with 1:1 case and control ratio. \n\nAll research participants underwent a mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and scores \u2265 27 were essential to be enrolled in the study. The disease severity was measured using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale and Hoehn and Yahr clinical rating scales. \n\nThe controls included spouse, relatives and friends/acquaintances of patients; however, one-to-one age and sex matching could be done for 26 participants and remaining 19 controls were derived from patients already undergoing an MRI scan for nonneurological indication, mostly a knee or shoulder MRI for osteoarthritis or rotator cuff evaluation. Controls could have controlled diabetes or hypertension, but no neurological symptoms or deficits, and a normal MMSE score. \n\nThe study was designed to enroll consecutive patients, but 3 patients and 4 controls had claustrophobia, 6 scans (4 patients and 2 controls) were deemed unsuitable due to motion artifact, presence of microbleeds and ischemic lesions and significant ventriculomegaly, and 3 patients opted out later; accordingly, 10 more cases and 6 controls were further enrolled to complete the estimated sample size. \n\nMRI of all cases and controls was performed on a 3T scanner (Discovery 750w, GE, United States), using a 40-channel head coil at the institute's radiodiagnosis department in the presence of the principal investigator. Patients underwent a full MRI scan of the brain, while controls underwent limited brain scan including a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and the 3D susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequence. The MR sequence studied was a high-resolution whole brain 3D SWI sequence using gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) with scan duration of 4\u2009minutes 26\u2009seconds, TR/TE-41/23 milliseconds, number of excitations (NEX) - 0.70, FLIP angle 15\u2009degrees, frequency field of view (FOV) 24, phase FOV 0.70, bandwidth 62.50, and Echo train length of 4. Magnitude and phase images were generated, which were later reformatted as minimum intensity projection (minIP) images. The axial slices were oriented parallel to a line drawn from genu to splenium of corpus callosum. The slice thickness of the acquisition was kept as 1\u2009mm to avoid slice overlap and also generate high-quality volumetric data. \n\nThe imaging data was anonymized and transferred to a commercial server-client solution (AW Server 4.7, GE, United States) and reviewed on the individual client workstations of the two radiologists, blinded to the patient's or control's status as such, who marked their entries on a form designed on the free software EpiInfo (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, United States). \n\nPresence or absence of the STS was assessed in axial sections on the 3D SWI sequence in nigrosome-1, which is seen in the posterior third of SN in midbrain on both sides. It normally appears as a high-signal structure maintaining a linear, comma or wedge shape, and bordered on both sides by low-signal structures (pars compacta SN and medial lemniscus), such that this complex resembles a swallow's tail. \n\n\nThe reports of STS were classified in the following four groups: bilateral absent, bilateral present, unilateral absent, and unilateral or bilateral faintly present. Bilateral absent, unilateral absent and faintly present were considered as absent STS (\n \n), considering the asymmetric onset of PD, and only bilateral presence were considered as a positive STS (\n \nand\n \n), to provide a simple dichotomized data for statistical evaluation.\n \n  \n\nClinical Parkinson's disease (\n  A  \n) Bilateral swallow tail sign (STS) absent in 74-year-old male (\n  B  \n) Absent STS on the right side and faintly positive on the left side (red arrow) in a 54-year-old female.\n \n    \n\nNormal swallow tail sign in control population (\n  A  \n) 46-year-old male (\n  B  \n) 60-year-old female.\n \n    \n\nClinical Parkinson's disease\u2014swallow tail sign seen in bilateral substantia nigra in a 45-year-old female marked by yellow arrows (false positive sign).\n \n  \nEach reader read the scan again after 4 weeks and a final joint reading session was done with both radiologists and the chief neurologist for each of the scans. The data was uploaded to Microsoft Excel 2010 and statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS for Windows version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). \n\n\nDemographics were compared between patients and controls using two sample\n  t  \n-test. For nonnormalized data, nonparametric tests were used for group comparisons. Fisher's exact test was used, if applicable, for sample distribution. Kappa value was determined for interrater agreement. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy were calculated. Descriptive data were described as numbers and percentages, and values were generated as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD);\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered as significant for all tests. Logistic regression with adjustment for age difference was done and OR derived. Images for publication were generated directly using the software's export function.\n \n\n\n## Results \n  \n\nA high intrarater and interrater agreement was observed, with kappa of 0.80 (\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.001) for either types, with an absolute agreement of 94%. For both raters, the differences were in the \u201cfaintly present\u201d and \u201cunilateral absent\u201d findings, while no discordance was observed in \u201cbilateral present\u201d or \u201cbilateral absent\u201d findings.\n \n\n\nThe data of patients and controls with presence and absence of the STS are tabulated in\n \n.\n \n   Age and sex distribution of positive and negative STS test in patients and controls      \n\nThe two sample\n  t  \n-test comparing the mean age of patients and controls showed significant difference, 59.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.78 years and 54.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.96 years, respectively (\n  p  \n\u2009=\u20090.0479). Mean age of the 34 true positive patients was 60.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.22 years, while the mean age of the remaining STS present participants (including the false negative patients and the controls) was 54.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.58 years, and the two sample\n  t  \n-test showed significant age difference between these two groups (\n  p  \n\u2009=\u20090.0125).\n \n\n\nMore males were seen in either groups, with the male to female ratio being 2.46:1 and 2.75:1 in patient and control groups, respectively, and the Fisher exact test showed equal distribution (\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, there was no significant difference in sex distribution of true positive and the STS present participants (Fisher exact test,\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.001).\n \n\nIn the study group, out of 45 patients, 34 (77.78%) had absent STS (true positives) and 11 (22.22%) had present STS (false negatives). Among the true positives, 25 were females and 9 were males; in false negatives, 6 were males and 5 were females. In the control group, out of 45 patients, STS was absent in 1 female patient (false positive) and present in 44 subjects (true negatives), out of whom 33 were males and 11 were females. \n\nKeeping clinical diagnosis as gold standard, the accuracy of absent STS in the diagnosis of PD and PD plus syndromes was 86.66%, sensitivity 75.55%, specificity 97.77%, PPV 97.14%, NPV 80%, and positive likelihood ratio 34. Using logistic regression, OR was 136 (95% CI 16.73\u20131105.57) and final OR after adjusting the age effect was 132 (95% CI 15.97\u20131098.75). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n\nSusceptibility weighted sequence (SWI/susceptibility-weighted angiography [SWAN]) is a 3D spoiled gradient-echo (GE) sequence that helps in delineation of blood degradation products and iron and calcium deposits. These paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and ferromagnetic substances increase the local magnetic inhomogeneity, leading to T2 shortening and hence drop in signal on T2* weighted GE sequences.\n \nSWI sequence consists of both phase and magnitude information. Paramagnetic substances, such as deoxyhemoglobin and hemosiderin, induce positive phase shift and diamagnetic substances, such as calcium, cause a negative phase shift. The iron content in SN in PD is nearly 80%, more than in healthy individuals, and appear dark on SWI sequence.\n \n\n\nPD is a neurological disease which is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Nigrosomes are the dopaminergic cells in the SN and are a part of five groups, of which nigrosome 1 is the largest group.\n \nNigrosome 1 appears bright on SWI sequence and seen in posterolateral part of SN pars compacta. Loss of nigrosome 1 manifests as absence of the STS.\n \n\n\nBlazejewska et al described the hyperintense linear area within the posterolateral region of the otherwise hypointense SN pars compacta on 7T MRI high-resolution T2*-weighted sequence, conforming to nigrosome 1 and was not seen in all 10 PD patients in their series.\n \nSchwarz et al described the similar structure as STS on high resolution T2*-weighted sequence on 3T MRI. The study predominantly included non-PD participants and demonstrated very high sensitivity (100%), high specificity (97%), NPV (1), PPV (0.69) and accuracy (96%) of the absent STS in PD patients compared with the presence of STS in the control group.\n \nFew studies available in the literature show variable sensitivity and specificity. A study by Cosottini et al established mean sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 94%, and diagnostic accuracy of 86% on 3T MRI.\n \nIn our study, specificity and PPV were higher, and sensitivity was on lower side (75.55%); however, the results were somewhat similar to Cosottini et al. On the other hand, Gao et al in a universality study found 49 participants from the control group (96.08%) had bilateral or unilateral presence of the STS, while 54 patients (100%) lacked the STS.\n \nInterestingly this study also had found 15 cases to be unsuitable due to artifacts or presence of brainstem disease. In our study, issues were also faced due to claustrophobia, presence of disease, or failure to perform one-to-one matching. On 7T MRI, Schmidt et al studied 13 healthy adults and observed the STS in 81% of cases, while 19% did not have the STS. The authors hypothesized that variable organization of nigrosome 1 in different individuals leads to lack of uniform signal in SWI; hence, few of the normal subjects may be classified as to harbor the disease (false positive).\n \nIn our series, false positive cases were very low, only 1 out of 45 controls (2.22%) showed absent STS.\n \n\n\nIn a study done to evaluate if loss of STS could distinguish PD from PPS, the authors included 25 PD, 21 PPS and 14 control subjects, and found there was no difference in the presence of sign between the two patient groups and sign was present in 79% of controls. The overall sensitivity of the absence of sign in PD and PPS was 0.76 and 0.91/1.0, while the specificity was 0.34 and 0.35/0.36, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the loss of the sign for controls versus all patients was 0.85, 0.79, and 0.83, respectively.\n \nIn our study, both PD and PPS patients were included and clubbed in one group and loss of the sign was then compared with normal controls. A subgroup analysis comparing these two groups also did not show any significant difference. Sensitivity and accuracy in our study are similar to the above study; however, the specificity and PPV of the sign was very high, nearly 97%, thus indicating very high likelihood of the presence of PD or PPS if the STS is absent. Also, comparing the STS in the two groups, the final OR adjusted to age calculated was 132, using logistic regression, with the simple interpretation being that the absence of the STS has a 132 times odds of having PD or PPS (\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.001).\n \n\nOur study had a visible effect of age on the performance of the STS, with mean age of true positive being higher than the mean age of false negative or the controls, indicating that the sensitivity of the test probably increases with age. This finding however needs to be confirmed with a larger study group. \n\n\nThe control population in our study had very few false positive test. This might be related to proper selection of the control group or the difference in the slice thickness, 1\u2009mm in our study versus 1.5 to 2\u2009mm in other studies.\n \nAlso, the images were read by two radiologists who had more than 10 years of experience, one being a neuroradiologist, and both being already involved in routine clinical and research work related to degenerative brain disorders. This finding is also significant in light of the knowledge that the readers were blinded yet had correctly classified 11 out of the 34 true positive cases as \u201cfaintly present STS\u201d (6 unilateral and 4 bilateral). Erroneous judgment of these cases as \u201cabsent STS\u201d could have significantly altered the statistical results. Also, the inter- and intrarater agreement of these \u201cunilateral present STS\u201d and \u201cfaintly present STS\u201d were very high.\n \n\n\nIn addition to SWI, high-resolution quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can be done for the imaging of nigrosome 1. A study was done at 3T in 38 idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) patients and 25 healthy subjects. The segmented SN that had susceptibility values lower than 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80 ppb were compared between the two groups and found that the voxels with values less than 70 ppb differentiated IPD and normal subjects with best diagnostic performance (\n  p  \n\u2009<\u20090.0001).\n \nThe technique needs to be further evaluated in larger studies.\n \n\nOur study has several limitations. We had clubbed PD and PPS participants together, and larger sample size of both groups could have offered better statistical differences. We did not compare the STS with the disease severity. Increase in sample size of PD patients will also help us to achieve more accurate results in future. Better age matching between the two groups could have offered sharper results. Also, the clinical diagnosis was taken as gold standard, even though the cases were taken from dedicated clinic with experienced staff, having consecutive patients. A randomized study design might have also been better. Other imaging parameters of the MRI, clinical scales, and other imaging tools like positron emission tomography (PET) or dopamine transported scan could have been included in the study to offer a composite model for evaluation of PD and PPS patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe healthy nigrosome-1 present in dorsolateral SN can be easily and reliably seen in the form of the STS on thin slice 3D SWI sequence at 3T MRI. The absence of the STS, indicating nigrosome-1 degeneration, can act as a diagnostic marker for the PD or PPS with very high specificity and PPV; hence, this sequence should always be included in the MRI protocol in imaging of suspected cases. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9187389, "text_md5": "3aa77636632c128da16fbcd04c96f9d7", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 109], "journal": [110, 132], "publication_year": [134, 138], "title": [149, 278], "keywords": [292, 384], "abstract": [397, 1985], "body": [1994, 18684]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35694067, "doi": "10.1055/s-0041-1740578", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9187389", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9187389"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9187389\">9187389</a>", "list_title": "PMC9187389  The Swallow Tail Sign of Substantia Nigra: A Case\u2013Control Study to Establish Its Role in Diagnosis of Parkinson Disease on 3T MRI"}

Du fait de ce glissement s\u00e9mantique, le terme de prion recouvre donc deux ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes bien distincts\u00a0: un m\u00e9canisme biochimique de transmission d\u2019une information biologique, d\u2019une part, (m\u00e9canisme de type prion, prot\u00e9ine de type prion, prions de levure, prions physiologiques, etc.)\u00a0; un agent transmissible responsable d\u2019une enc\u00e9phalopathie chez l\u2019homme et l\u2019animal d\u2019autre part. Si les concepts m\u00e9canistiques et infectieux sont bien associ\u00e9s dans le cas des maladies \u00e0 prions, il semble clair que cela ne vaut pas dans tout ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne biologique o\u00f9 ces modifications conformationnelles sont observ\u00e9es. \n\n\n### PrP  et PrP \n  \nLa forme normale de la prot\u00e9ine prion (PrP) est la prot\u00e9ine PrP  dont la structure primaire comprend, chez l\u2019homme, 253\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s avec un poids mol\u00e9culaire qui varie de 33\u00a0\u00e0 35\u00a0kDa selon le niveau de glycosylation. Sa structure secondaire est constitu\u00e9e d\u2019un taux \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019h\u00e9lices \u03b1 (42\u00a0%) et de peu de feuillets \u03b2 (3\u00a0%). Sa structure tridimensionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique nucl\u00e9aire sur des prot\u00e9ines recombinantes  . Elle se compose d\u2019une partie   N  -terminale, des acides amin\u00e9s 23\u00a0\u00e0 121, qui a une structure tr\u00e8s flexible pouvant adopter plusieurs conformations en fonction de l\u2019environnement,\u00a0d\u2019une structure globulaire stable contenant 3\u00a0h\u00e9lices \u03b1 au niveau des acides amin\u00e9s 144\u2013154\u00a0; 175\u2013193\u00a0; 200\u2013219\u00a0et 2\u00a0courts feuillets \u03b2 antiparall\u00e8les au niveau 128\u2013131\u00a0; 161\u2013164\u00a0et d\u2019une partie   C  -terminale poss\u00e9dant une ancre GPI permettant d\u2019arrimer la PrP au feuillet externe de la membrane cellulaire. Si le r\u00f4le physiologique jou\u00e9 par la PrP cellulaire reste d\u00e9battu, elle s\u2019av\u00e8re indispensable au d\u00e9veloppement de la maladie puisque les animaux dont le g\u00e8ne de la   PrP   a \u00e9t\u00e9 invalid\u00e9 (animaux \u00ab\u00a0knockout\u00a0\u00bb ou KO) ne sont pas susceptibles aux ATNC  . Son niveau d\u2019expression a un r\u00f4le d\u00e9terminant dans la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incubation qui est d\u2019autant plus courte que le niveau d\u2019expression est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Enfin certains polymorphismes du g\u00e8ne   PRNP   codant la   PrP   et surtout le polymorphisme m\u00e9thionine/valine au codon 129\u00a0jouent un r\u00f4le important dans la susceptibilit\u00e9 individuelle aux ESST. L\u2019homologie de s\u00e9quence entre la PrP  de l\u2019inoculum et la PrP  de l\u2019h\u00f4te d\u00e9termine en partie la barri\u00e8re d\u2019esp\u00e8ce lors d\u2019une transmission intersp\u00e9cifique. Ainsi les souris sont r\u00e9sistantes aux souches de hamster sauf si l\u2019on introduit dans leur g\u00e9nome une PrP  de hamster  . Ceci est vrai aussi pour les souches humaines dont la transmission n\u00e9cessite en plus de l\u2019introduction du g\u00e8ne humain l\u2019invalidation du g\u00e8ne de la   PrP   murine. Dans certains mod\u00e8les, l\u2019expression d\u2019une prot\u00e9ine PrP chim\u00e8re dont les extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s portent les s\u00e9quences murines et le domaine central une s\u00e9quence humaine facilite la transmission des souches humaines, particularit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e par l\u2019action de cofacteurs associ\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques d\u2019esp\u00e8ce encore non d\u00e9termin\u00e9s (prot\u00e9ine X)  . \n\nLa forme pathologique de la PrP, la PrP  (pour PrP scrapie) a la m\u00eame structure primaire que la PrP . La digestion par la prot\u00e9inase K utilis\u00e9e lors de la purification de la prot\u00e9ine conduit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9limination de la portion   N  -terminale de la PrP g\u00e9n\u00e9rant une forme de 27\u00a0\u00e0 30\u00a0kDa. Comme la PrP , la PrP  poss\u00e8de une ancre GPI, et son profil de glycosylation est identique \u00e0 celui de la PrP . L\u2019analyse de la structure secondaire de la PrP , bien qu\u2019incompl\u00e8te, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 d\u2019importantes diff\u00e9rences avec celle de la PrP cellulaire, sugg\u00e9rant un enrichissement marqu\u00e9 en feuillets \u03b2 pliss\u00e9es  ,  . \u00c0 ce jour, en raison des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s physico-chimiques de la PrP  (pouvoir d\u2019agr\u00e9gation, insolubilit\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9tergents), aucune structure tertiaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique ou par cristallographie aux rayons X.\u00a0Les seules structures disponibles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies par mod\u00e9lisation mol\u00e9culaire. \n\nLes ATNC poss\u00e8dent des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s peu communes de r\u00e9sistance aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s habituels d\u2019inactivation des agents microbiologiques. Les ultrasons, les rayonnements ionisants et non ionisants, les nucl\u00e9ases, le formald\u00e9hyde et les d\u00e9tergents sont peu efficaces, voire totalement inefficaces. Par ailleurs, ces agents pr\u00e9sentent une forte r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l\u2019inactivation par la chaleur s\u00e8che. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019infectivit\u00e9 r\u00e9siste bien mieux aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u00e9truisant les acides nucl\u00e9iques qu\u2019aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s d\u00e9gradant ou d\u00e9naturant les prot\u00e9ines\u00a0; ainsi, les ions chaotropes, le ph\u00e9nol ou les digestions par des prot\u00e9ases diminuent sensiblement le titre infectieux. \n\n\n### Avanc\u00e9es r\u00e9centes en faveur de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du prion \n  \nLa r\u00e9plication des prions reposerait sur un m\u00e9canisme de conversion prot\u00e9ique dans lequel la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une forme pathologique, en r\u00e8gle agr\u00e9g\u00e9e et riche en feuillets \u03b2-pliss\u00e9s, d\u2019une prot\u00e9ine d\u00e9clenche l\u2019agr\u00e9gation de la forme normale qui devient \u00e0 son tour capable de promouvoir le recrutement et la polym\u00e9risation de la prot\u00e9ine normale  . Plusieurs mod\u00e8les en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9s, notamment\u00a0:   \nle mod\u00e8le de conversion (ou polym\u00e9risation) assist\u00e9 par une amorce dans lequel la PrP  serait plus stable que la PrP  mais cin\u00e9tiquement inaccessible, la conversion passerait par un interm\u00e9diaire conformationnel \u00e9quidistant thermodynamiquement de la PrP  et de la PrP , la liaison entre la PrP  et cet interm\u00e9diaire favoriserait sa conversion en PrP  ( \nA)\u00a0;   \nMod\u00e8les de la conversion de la PrPc en PrPsc  ,  . A. Mod\u00e8le de polym\u00e9risation assist\u00e9e par une amorce. B. Mod\u00e8le de nucl\u00e9ation-polym\u00e9risation. \n  \n  \nle mod\u00e8le de nucl\u00e9ation-polym\u00e9risation dans lequel la transconformation de la PrP  en PrP  monom\u00e9rique serait r\u00e9versible, la PrP  \u00e9tant moins stable que la PrP  la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019agr\u00e9gats d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant l\u2019\u00e9quilibre vers la formation de PrP ,  . La liaison entre la PrP  et cet interm\u00e9diaire favoriserait sa conversion en PrP  ( B). \n  \n\nDans ces mod\u00e8les, une conversion spontan\u00e9e, ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne al\u00e9atoire et rare possiblement li\u00e9 \u00e0 une mutation somatique, conduirait \u00e0 une forme sporadique. Dans les formes g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une mutation augmenterait la probabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement de conversion. Dans les formes infectieuses, l\u2019introduction de PrP  dans un organisme h\u00f4te conduirait dans certaines conditions au recrutement et \u00e0 la conversion de la PrP  endog\u00e8ne. La diss\u00e9mination de cette anomalie conformationnelle serait assur\u00e9e par la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019ont ces structures agr\u00e9g\u00e9es \u00e0 passer d\u2019une cellule \u00e0 l\u2019autre (\u00ab\u00a0spreading\u00a0\u00bb) selon des m\u00e9canismes non compl\u00e8tement \u00e9lucid\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour (exocytose/endocytose, exosomes, nanotubes\u2026). Apr\u00e8s avoir atteint leurs cellules cibles, les noyaux d\u2019agr\u00e9gation gardent leur activit\u00e9 et sont capables de recruter et de convertir la prot\u00e9ine de l\u2019h\u00f4te. \n\nLa d\u00e9monstration de la validit\u00e9 du mod\u00e8le du prion passe par la production, \u00e0 partir de PrP , de PrP  infectieuse dans un syst\u00e8me exp\u00e9rimental contr\u00f4l\u00e9. Diff\u00e9rentes approches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9es dans le but de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du prion. Elles ont permis d\u2019apporter des arguments en sa faveur et de valider l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019une conversion PrP -d\u00e9pendante de la PrP  en PrP prot\u00e9inase K r\u00e9sistante. \n\nTr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment, quatre avanc\u00e9es majeures ont apport\u00e9 des arguments presque d\u00e9finitifs en faveur de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se du prion, elles doivent tout de m\u00eame \u00eatre confirm\u00e9es\u00a0:   \nle groupe de Susan Lindquist au MIT a mis \u00e0 profit la technique de la mutagen\u00e8se dirig\u00e9e pour produire des lign\u00e9es murines exprimant une PrP humaine D178N-M129\u00a0ou une PrP E200K. Alors que la lign\u00e9e D178-M129\u00a0d\u00e9veloppait un ph\u00e9notype clinico-pathologique tr\u00e8s proche de l\u2019IFF (insomnie, troubles neurov\u00e9g\u00e9tatifs et atrophie thalamique), les souris E200K pr\u00e9sentaient une maladie proche de la MCJ  ,  . Les deux maladies \u00e9taient transmissibles et conservaient leurs caract\u00e9ristiques lors des passages successifs\u00a0; \n  \ndes \u00e9quipes ind\u00e9pendantes ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019amplification de la PrP  issue d\u2019un sujet atteint et produite dans un tube \u00e0 essai par la technique de Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) s\u2019accompagnait d\u2019une amplification de l\u2019infectiosit\u00e9  ,  \u00a0; \n  \ndes agents infectieux ont pu \u00eatre produits par la m\u00e9thode de PMCA en utilisant des composants \u00ab\u00a0prion-free\u00a0\u00bb tr\u00e8s simple\u00a0: PrP  extraite de cerveau normal, poly-A, lipides ou PrP recombinante produite dans   E  .\u00a0  coli  , ARN totaux extraits du foie de souris saine, lipide de synth\u00e8se  ,  \u00a0; \n  \nle groupe de Stanley Prusiner a pu produire un prion synth\u00e9tique en modifiant la conformation et l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019agr\u00e9gation d\u2019une PrP recombinante tronqu\u00e9e  ,  . \n  \n\n\n### Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de souches \n  \nUne diversit\u00e9 de souches a pu \u00eatre mise en \u00e9vidence par des exp\u00e9riences de transmission dans des lign\u00e9es de souris ayant le m\u00eame fond g\u00e9n\u00e9tique. En pratique, pour une m\u00eame dose infectante inocul\u00e9e selon une voie donn\u00e9e, chaque souche d\u2019agent induit chez des souris syng\u00e9niques, une maladie caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par\u00a0:   \nun temps d\u2019incubation bien d\u00e9termin\u00e9\u00a0; \n  \nun profil l\u00e9sionnel caract\u00e9ristique dont les crit\u00e8res sont les sites d\u2019accumulation dans le syst\u00e8me nerveux central (SNC) de la PrP  et de la spongiose. \n  \n\nLes caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019une souche ne s\u2019\u00e9tablissent qu\u2019apr\u00e8s 2\u00a0\u00e0 3\u00a0passages s\u00e9ri\u00e9s\u00a0: le temps d\u2019incubation diminue pour se stabiliser et les profils l\u00e9sionnels deviennent constants. On dit alors que la souche est \u00ab\u00a0stabilis\u00e9e\u00a0\u00bb. Plus d\u2019une vingtaine de souches diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi isol\u00e9es \u00e0 partir d\u2019ESST naturelles (tremblante du mouton, de la ch\u00e8vre, enc\u00e9phalopathie spongiforme bovine\u2026). Le support mol\u00e9culaire de la diversit\u00e9 des souches de prions reposerait sur la capacit\u00e9 de la PrP \u00e0 adopter des conformations et \u00e0 former des assemblages diff\u00e9rents  ,  . \n\n\n### Propagation p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique dans les maladies \u00e0 prions \n  \nDans le cas d\u2019une contamination par voie p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (voie orale ou intrap\u00e9riton\u00e9ale par exemple), une \u00e9tape de r\u00e9plication dans les tissus lympho\u00efdes est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la neuroinvasion. Chez l\u2019homme, ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement bien mis en \u00e9vidence dans la variante de la MCJ. L\u2019agent est trouv\u00e9 dans les structures lympho\u00efdes, notamment celles associ\u00e9es au tube digestif, au sein des cellules folliculaires dendritiques des follicules \u00e0 centres clairs  . Il utilise ensuite l\u2019abondante innervation sympathique de ces tissus pour gagner, via les ganglions c\u0153liaques et stellaires, la m\u0153lle \u00e9pini\u00e8re pour ensuite se propager \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du SNC  ,  . Une prion\u00e9mie est \u00e9galement associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette forme et quelques cas post-transfusionnels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9s au Royaume-Uni  ,  . \n\n\n\n## L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine \n  \n### L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine, une prot\u00e9ine intracellulaire, composant majeur des corps de Lewy \n  \nL\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine a \u00e9t\u00e9 isol\u00e9e et s\u00e9quenc\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de l\u2019organe \u00e9lectrique du poisson torpille en 1988. Dans sa description initiale, l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Richard Scheller a montr\u00e9 que cette prot\u00e9ine neuronale de 143\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s \u00e9tait localis\u00e9e dans les terminaisons synaptiques et dans le noyau, d\u2019o\u00f9 son nom (\u00ab\u00a0syn\u00a0\u00bb pour synapse et \u00ab\u00a0nuclein\u00a0\u00bb pour noyau)  . Une prot\u00e9ine homologue de 140\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e dans le SNC du rat et de l\u2019homme  . Cette d\u00e9couverte de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine n\u2019a re\u00e7u initialement que peu d\u2019\u00e9cho. Il a fallu attendre la deuxi\u00e8me partie des ann\u00e9es 1990\u00a0et l\u2019identification d\u2019une mutation du g\u00e8ne codant l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine, dans une famille avec une maladie de Parkinson de transmission autosomique dominante, pour que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine passe sur le devant de la sc\u00e8ne  . Quelques mois apr\u00e8s la mise en \u00e9vidence de cette premi\u00e8re forme monog\u00e9nique de maladie de Parkinson, une \u00e9quipe de Cambridge a montr\u00e9 que les corps et prolongements de Lewy de patients atteints de formes sporadiques de la maladie \u00e9taient fortement immunor\u00e9actifs pour l\u2019\u03b1 -synucl\u00e9ine et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait donc un des principaux composants de la pathologie de Lewy  . En 2002, Fujiwara et al. ont par ailleurs montr\u00e9 que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pr\u00e9sente dans les corps et prolongements de Lewy \u00e9tait non seulement agr\u00e9g\u00e9e mais aussi phosphoryl\u00e9e sur un r\u00e9sidu s\u00e9rine (S\u00e9rine 129)  . L\u2019immunohistochimie de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et de la phospho-\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est depuis lors devenue la technique de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la mise en \u00e9vidence des corps et prolongements de Lewy, cette approche \u00e9tant plus sensible que les techniques qui \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9es auparavant qu\u2019elles soient histochimiques (marquage h\u00e9matine/\u00e9osine) ou immunohistochimiques (anticorps anti-ubiquitine)  . Cette technique a permis une analyse plus pr\u00e9cise de la distribution de la pathologie de Lewy. Elle a en effet montr\u00e9 qu\u2019en dehors de la substance noire, certaines structures du SNC comme le bulbe olfactif et le noyau dorsal moteur du vague et des syst\u00e8mes nerveux autonomes p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques comme le syst\u00e8me nerveux ent\u00e9rique (SNE) sont touch\u00e9es par le processus pathologique chez la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des patients parkinsoniens  ,  . \n\nDepuis 1997, de nombreux travaux se sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s aux r\u00f4les physiologique et physiopathologique de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine humaine est une petite prot\u00e9ine de 140\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s (14,5\u00a0kDa) divis\u00e9e d\u2019un point de vue fonctionnel en 3\u00a0domaines ( \nA). La partie amino-terminale est fortement conserv\u00e9e entre les 3\u00a0isoformes de synucl\u00e9ine et est impliqu\u00e9e dans la liaison de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine aux lipides et aux membranes cellulaires. Le domaine central joue un r\u00f4le essentiel dans les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019agr\u00e9gation de la prot\u00e9ine alors que l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 carboxy-terminale serait responsable de l\u2019activit\u00e9 chaperonne et contient les principaux sites de phosphorylation. Bien que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pr\u00e9sente une conformation monom\u00e9rique en solution, elle a une capacit\u00e9 naturelle \u00e0 s\u2019agr\u00e9ger en structures amylo\u00efdes gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son domaine central selon la progression suivante\u00a0: dim\u00e8res, oligom\u00e8res, protofibrilles et fibrilles puis enfin corps de Lewy ( B). L\u2019agr\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est plus importante pour les formes tronqu\u00e9es de la prot\u00e9ine et pour les formes mut\u00e9es responsables de maladie de Parkinson g\u00e9n\u00e9tique. L\u2019introduction d\u2019oligom\u00e8res ou de protofibrilles pr\u00e9form\u00e9s dans des neurones en culture primaire ou in vivo provoque une agr\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine endog\u00e8ne, un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne appel\u00e9 \u00ab\u00a0nucl\u00e9ation\u00a0\u00bb (revue dans  ).   \nA. Structure primaire de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine humaine. L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine humaine est une petite prot\u00e9ine de 140\u00a0acides amin\u00e9s divis\u00e9e d\u2019un point de vue fonctionnel en 3\u00a0domaines. La partie amino-terminale (r\u00e9sidus 1\u00a0\u00e0 60) contient 6\u00a0domaines de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition imparfaite (R1\u00a0\u00e0 R6) contenant des r\u00e9sidus lysine, impliqu\u00e9s dans la liaison aux lipides et aux membranes cellulaires. Le domaine central (r\u00e9sidus 61\u00a0\u00e0 95) joue un r\u00f4le essentiel dans les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019agr\u00e9gation de la prot\u00e9ine alors que l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 carboxy-terminale (r\u00e9sidus 96\u2013140) serait responsable de l\u2019activit\u00e9 et contient le principal sites de phosphorylation sur le r\u00e9sidu s\u00e9rine 129. B. Agr\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. Des \u00e9tudes in vitro ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est en \u00e9quilibre dynamique. La forme monom\u00e9rique a une capacit\u00e9 naturelle \u00e0 s\u2019agr\u00e9ger en structures amylo\u00efdes gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son domaine central selon la progression suivante\u00a0: dim\u00e8res, oligom\u00e8res, protofibrilles et fibrilles puis enfin corps de Lewy. \n  \n\n\n### L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est aussi une prot\u00e9ine extracellulaire \n  \nBien que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine ait longtemps \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une prot\u00e9ine purement intracellulaire, la pr\u00e9sence de la prot\u00e9ine dans le liquide c\u00e9phalo-rachidien et le plasma a logiquement conduit certains groupes \u00e0 \u00e9tudier si elle pouvait \u00eatre s\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e. Plusieurs \u00e9quipes ind\u00e9pendantes ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine \u00e9tait en effet s\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e puisque mise en \u00e9vidence dans le milieu de culture de neurones du SNC ou du syst\u00e8me nerveux p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique  ,  . Cette s\u00e9cr\u00e9tion d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine se produit en condition physiologique mais est plus importante en conditions pathologiques par exemple lors d\u2019un stress oxydant, d\u2019une dysfonction mitochondriale ou du syst\u00e8me ubiquitine-prot\u00e9asome. Dans ces conditions pathologiques, l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est essentiellement lib\u00e9r\u00e9e sous forme oligom\u00e9rique  . L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine serait s\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9canismes impliquant des m\u00e9canismes conventionnels ou non conventionnels d\u2019exocytose ainsi que la voie des exosomes  ,  ,  . Il est probable que les voies de s\u00e9cr\u00e9tion mises en jeu d\u00e9pendent du type de neurone impliqu\u00e9, p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ou central. \n\n\n\n## Arguments en faveur d\u2019une progression \u00ab\u00a0prion-like\u00a0\u00bb au cours de la maladie de Parkinson \n  \n### Corps de Lewy dans des neurones embryonnaires transplant\u00e9s \n  \nL\u2019observation de corps de Lewy (CL) et de neurites de Lewy (NL), dans certains neurones embryonnaires transplant\u00e9s 11\u00a0\u00e0 16\u00a0ans auparavant dans le striatum de patients parkinsoniens a \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier argument en faveur d\u2019une transmission de cellules \u00e0 cellules de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts constitu\u00e9s majoritairement d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine  ,  . En effet, la pr\u00e9sence de ces inclusions est anormale dans des neurones jeunes. Les inclusions sont constitu\u00e9es des m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments (\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine fibrillaire phosphoryl\u00e9e en S\u00e9rine 129, ubiquitine) que les CL observ\u00e9s dans la substantia nigra des patients parkinsoniens  . Ces inclusions sont marqu\u00e9es par la thioflavine S indiquant la pr\u00e9sence de feuillets \u03b2. Il existe parall\u00e8lement une diminution du transporteur de la dopamine et de la tyrosine hydroxylase  . Cependant, l\u2019apparition des inclusions ne concerne pas tous les neurones chez un patient donn\u00e9   et l\u2019analyse post-mortem du cerveau de patients greff\u00e9s 9\u00a0\u00e0 14\u00a0ans auparavant peut r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des neurones greff\u00e9s fonctionnels et sans inclusions pathologiques  . L\u2019\u00e9tude de Kurowska et al. a montr\u00e9 que les greffes les plus \u00e2g\u00e9es (plus de 20\u00a0ans) ont une expression r\u00e9duite de la tyrosine hydroxylase et du transporteur de la dopamine et une pathologie de Lewy plus marqu\u00e9e  . Une des hypoth\u00e8ses pouvant expliquer ces observations est celle d\u2019une propagation de l\u2019anomalie conformationnelle du tissu h\u00f4te vers le greffon \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re des prions. Prusiner et Olanow l\u2019ont formalis\u00e9 en proposant que la maladie de Parkinson pourrait \u00eatre une maladie \u00e0 prion  , r\u00e9sultant directement d\u2019une augmentation de la production ou d\u2019une diminution de la clearance de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine favorisant son repliement anormal et la formation d\u2019oligom\u00e8res neurotoxiques. L\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pourrait \u00eatre un analogue de la prot\u00e9ine prion capable d\u2019auto-agr\u00e9gation et de diss\u00e9mination \u00e0 des cellules saines. \n\n\n### Exp\u00e9rimentations in vitro en faveur des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de \u00ab\u00a0seeding and spreading\u00a0\u00bb \n  \nLes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019agr\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9es in vitro.

Les fibrilles peuvent constituer une amorce (\u00ab\u00a0seeds\u00a0\u00bb) et acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la formation de fibrilles \u00e0 partir d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine monom\u00e9rique.

Dans le cerveau de ces souris inocul\u00e9es, il est mis en \u00e9vidence une gliose astrocytaire avec une activation microgliale et des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts diffus d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine phosphoryl\u00e9e sensible \u00e0 la prot\u00e9inase K et insoluble dans les d\u00e9tergents.

La diversit\u00e9 des souches pourrait, au moins en partie, expliquer la diversit\u00e9 des formes de synucl\u00e9inopathies (maladie de Parkinson, d\u00e9mence \u00e0 corps de Lewy, atrophie multisyst\u00e9matis\u00e9e) et la diversit\u00e9 ph\u00e9notypique au sein de chacune de ces formes. Au-del\u00e0 des aspects fondamentaux, cette question pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences op\u00e9rationnelles si l\u2019on se souvient que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures de d\u00e9contamination et des compos\u00e9s anti-prion d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins th\u00e9rapeutiques varient selon les souches. L\u2019\u00e9quipe de Lee et al. a montr\u00e9 que des fibres d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine recombinante ayant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s biochimiques diff\u00e9rentes n\u2019avaient pas la m\u00eame capacit\u00e9 d\u2019induire une tauopathie in vitro et in vivo, sugg\u00e9rant un lien entre structure des assemblages d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et pouvoir pathog\u00e8ne \u00e9vocateur d\u2019un effet souche  . Cette hypoth\u00e8se a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9e par un travail franco-belge montrant que l\u2019injection intrac\u00e9r\u00e9brale d\u2019assemblages d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine de structures diff\u00e9rentes induisait des ph\u00e9notypes distincts chez le rat  . \u00c0 ce jour, les diff\u00e9rentes souches pr\u00e9sentes chez l\u2019homme n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement isol\u00e9es et les assemblages d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine responsables de la maladie de Parkinson, de la d\u00e9mence \u00e0 corps de Lewy et des diff\u00e9rentes MSA ne sont pas connus. \n\n\n\n\n## Est-il possible d\u2019int\u00e9grer l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se   prion-like  \u00a0avec la progression neuropathologique de la maladie de Parkinson\u00a0? \n  \nEn faisant le constat que certaines structures c\u00e9r\u00e9brales sont toujours touch\u00e9es par la pathologie de Lewy quand d\u2019autres sont int\u00e8gres, Braak et al. ont propos\u00e9 un sc\u00e9nario de progression temporo-spatiale de la pathologie de Lewy  . Grossi\u00e8rement ascendante, elle est class\u00e9e en 6\u00a0stades ( \n)\u00a0: les premi\u00e8res l\u00e9sions enc\u00e9phaliques sont observ\u00e9es dans le noyau dorsal du vague, le bulbe olfactif et les noyaux olfactifs ant\u00e9rieurs au stade 1. Des agr\u00e9gats d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine sont alors d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sents dans les centres sympathiques m\u00e9dullaires, dans les axones des eff\u00e9rences vagales (noyau dorsal du vague) et au niveau du SNE. Au stade 2, les l\u00e9sions gagnent les noyaux du raph\u00e9 et le locus c\u0153ruleus. C\u2019est \u00e0 partir du stade 3\u00a0que le m\u00e9senc\u00e9phale et la substance noire sont touch\u00e9s conjointement \u00e0 certains noyaux de la base (noyau basal de Meynert) et \u00e0 l\u2019amygdale. L\u2019atteinte de l\u2019amygdale est massive au stade 4, et s\u2019accompagne de l\u00e9sions du m\u00e9socortex temporal et de la corne d\u2019Amon. Puis l\u2019atteinte corticale gagne l\u2019insula et le cortex cingulaire (stade 5) et le n\u00e9ocortex dans son ensemble (stade 6).   \nCorr\u00e9lation anatomo-clinique de la progression temporo-spatiale de la pathologie de Lewy selon le mod\u00e8le de Braak. \n  \n\nCe mod\u00e8le de progression s\u00e9quentielle est confort\u00e9 par des arguments cliniques et anatomiques. Des \u00e9tudes \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques prospectives ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019anosmie, la constipation et les troubles du comportement en sommeil paradoxal constituent des signes pr\u00e9curseurs de la maladie de Parkinson (revue dans  ). L\u2019atteinte des centres autonomes et olfactifs au stade 1\u00a0et du locus subc\u0153ruleus au stade 2\u00a0rendrait compte, respectivement, de ces signes cliniques ( ). Prenant exemple sur la transmission du prion, Braak et al. posent l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019un pathog\u00e8ne neurotoxique qui provoquerait une atteinte initiale des structures nerveuses ent\u00e9riques en d\u00e9clenchant in situ une agr\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. Le processus pathologique serait v\u00e9hicul\u00e9 par transport axonal r\u00e9trograde et par voie trans-synaptique. Il gagnerait le SNC et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le noyau dorsal moteur du vague en suivant l\u2019innervation vagale comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit pour l\u2019agent bovin qui se propage via le syst\u00e8me nerveux autonome associ\u00e9 au tube digestif dans la variante de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob   ou pour des traceurs neuronaux  . Dans ce mod\u00e8le, la substance noire n\u2019est en d\u00e9finitive que l\u2019un des maillons de cette cha\u00eene d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements propagatifs. \n\nLes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s biologiques de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine (capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019agr\u00e9ger, s\u00e9cr\u00e9tion, recapture) viennent logiquement s\u2019int\u00e9grer dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de Braak. Il est tentant d\u2019imaginer qu\u2019une fois la formation d\u2019agr\u00e9gats d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine initi\u00e9e dans le SNE ou les voies olfactives, l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pathologique se propage de proche en proche le long de voies anatomiques bien d\u00e9finies reproduisant la progression temporo-spatiale propos\u00e9e par Braak et al. ( \n). Plusieurs donn\u00e9es exp\u00e9rimentales viennent renforcer cette hypoth\u00e8se. Dans une \u00e9tude anatomique tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cise r\u00e9alis\u00e9e chez le rat, Phillips et al. ont montr\u00e9 que les eff\u00e9rences vagales, qui trouvent leur origine dans le noyau dorsal du vague, expriment fortement l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et qu\u2019elles ne font synapse qu\u2019avec des neurones ent\u00e9riques eux aussi riches en \u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. Ces donn\u00e9es sugg\u00e8rent l\u2019existence d\u2019une voie anatomique contenant beaucoup d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine entre l\u2019intestin et le cerveau qui pourrait propager le processus pathologique du SNC au SNE et vice versa  . Ainsi des exp\u00e9riences d\u2019injection locale d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine dans diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gion du SNC et du SNE ont permis de montrer que l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pathologique pouvait diffuser   i  n vivo dans des r\u00e9gions connect\u00e9es anatomiquement\u00a0:   \nl\u2019injection st\u00e9r\u00e9otaxique de formes fibrillaires d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine humaine dans le striatum dorsal de souris provoque, comme on l\u2019a vu plus haut, non seulement la formation de corps et de prolongements de Lewy au site d\u2019injection mais aussi, apr\u00e8s 3\u00a0\u00e0 6\u00a0mois, dans l\u2019amygdale, la substance noire pars compacta, le bulbe olfactif et les couches IV et V du n\u00e9ocortex ipsilat\u00e9raux  \u00a0; \n  \nl\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine surexprim\u00e9e dans le noyau dorsal moteur du vague \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019un vecteur viral gagne progressivement le complexe locus c\u0153ruleus/subc\u0153ruleus, l\u2019hypothalamus et l\u2019amygdale homolat\u00e9raux et \u00e0 un moindre degr\u00e9 contralat\u00e9raux  \u00a0; \n  \ndes formes fibrillaires d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine inject\u00e9es dans la paroi de l\u2019estomac et du duod\u00e9num sont transport\u00e9es par le nerf vague jusqu\u2019au noyau dorsal moteur du vague  \u00a0; \n  \nune injection dans le bulbe olfactif de formes oligom\u00e9riques et fibrillaires entra\u00eene \u00e0 terme la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019inclusions d\u2019\u03b1-synucleine dans le cortex frontal  . \n    \nRepr\u00e9sentation sch\u00e9matique des possibles facteurs responsables de l\u2019agr\u00e9gation et de la propagation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine selon un m\u00e9canisme   prion-like  . 1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Entr\u00e9e d\u2019un facteur exog\u00e8ne (virus, neurotoxique, agr\u00e9gats d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine) par voie orale ou nasale, \u00e9ventuellement favoris\u00e9e par un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne inflammatoire. 2\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Diss\u00e9mination des agr\u00e9gats d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine ing\u00e9r\u00e9s, inhal\u00e9s ou form\u00e9s, in situ, sous l\u2019influence du virus ou du neurotoxique \u00e0 partir du syst\u00e8me nerveux p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique.

Parmi les virus qui pourraient \u00eatre en cause, notons que l\u2019influenza A est un virus \u00e0 l\u2019origine de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes auto-immuns qui a un tropisme particulier pour la substantia nigra, le cervelet ou l\u2019hippocampe. L\u2019implication d\u2019autres virus comme l\u2019herp\u00e8s simplex ou le coronavirus a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9e  . \n\nDes arguments exp\u00e9rimentaux plaident, depuis longtemps, pour une origine inflammatoire de la maladie de Parkinson avec l\u2019observation dans les cerveaux de patients parkinsoniens d\u2019une augmentation du nombre de cellules microgliales activ\u00e9es et de l\u2019expression de cytokines pro-inflammatoires  ,  . Des arguments \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques plaident aussi en faveur de cette possible origine inflammatoire. Ainsi, une \u00e9tude r\u00e9trospective portant sur 196\u00a0patients parkinsoniens appari\u00e9s sur le sexe et l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e0 196\u00a0t\u00e9moins de population g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a montr\u00e9 que les parkinsoniens avaient deux fois plus d\u2019ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019allergie de type asthme, rhinites allergiques ou saisonni\u00e8res que les t\u00e9moins  . Cependant, le caract\u00e8re r\u00e9trospectif et l\u2019effectif limit\u00e9 incitent \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les r\u00e9sultats de cette \u00e9tude avec prudence. Plus r\u00e9cemment, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 montr\u00e9 que la consommation d\u2019anti-inflammatoires non st\u00e9ro\u00efdiens pourrait diminuer le risque de d\u00e9velopper la maladie de Parkinson  . \n\nL\u2019implication d\u2019une substance neurotoxique comme cause de la maladie de Parkinson a connu un regain d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1970\u00a0et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980\u00a0par l\u2019observation de cas de syndromes parkinsoniens aigus apr\u00e8s injection de MPTP. En 1976, un jeune toxicomane am\u00e9ricain a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un syndrome parkinsonien quelques jours apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre inject\u00e9 un opio\u00efde de synth\u00e8se contenant des traces de MPTP. Son d\u00e9c\u00e8s d\u2019une overdose deux ans plus tard a permis de mettre en \u00e9vidence, \u00e0 l\u2019autopsie, une destruction des neurones pigment\u00e9s dopaminergiques de la substantia nigra avec m\u00eame des inclusions pouvant ressembler \u00e0 des corps de Lewy  . L\u2019observation de quatre autres cas quelques ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s a permis de confirmer le lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre l\u2019injection du MPTP et l\u2019\u00e9mergence de ce syndrome parkinsonien s\u00e9v\u00e8re r\u00e9pondant au traitement dopaminergique  . Le MPTP a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite utilis\u00e9, comme la 6-OHDA, pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des mod\u00e8les de syndromes parkinsoniens chez l\u2019animal de laboratoire. Cependant, ces neurotoxiques sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de syndromes parkinsoniens aigus ne reproduisant pas l\u2019apparition lente et progressive des sympt\u00f4mes chez l\u2019homme. De nombreuses \u00e9tudes \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019exposition professionnelle et m\u00eame non professionnelle \u00e0 des pesticides augmentait le risque de d\u00e9velopper une maladie de Parkinson  . Cette association, mise en \u00e9vidence avec un grand nombre de pesticides, pr\u00e9sente dans certains cas une relation effet-dose  . Le stress oxydatif et le dysfonctionnement mitochondrial sont deux m\u00e9canismes physiopathologiques impliqu\u00e9s dans les mod\u00e8les exp\u00e9rimentaux et dans les formes g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques de maladie de Parkinson. Une \u00e9tude cas-t\u00e9moin a rapport\u00e9 une association entre l\u2019utilisation de pesticides \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un stress oxydatif comme le paraquat ou inhibant le complexe I mitochondrial comme la rot\u00e9none  . Avec ce dernier pesticide, un mod\u00e8le animal reproduisant la progression \u00ab\u00a0prion-like\u00a0\u00bb de la maladie de Parkinson selon le mod\u00e8le de Braak a pu \u00eatre mis au point  . L\u2019administration par sonde gastrique de 5\u00a0mg/kg/jour de rot\u00e9none chez la souris sauvage C57BL/6\u00a0permet d\u2019observer, apr\u00e8s 1\u00a0mois et demi de traitement, des agr\u00e9gats d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine, d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine phosphoryl\u00e9e et une gliose dans le syst\u00e8me nerveux ent\u00e9rique. Apr\u00e8s 3\u00a0mois, le nombre de ces agr\u00e9gats va diminuer avec l\u2019apparition d\u2019inclusions de plus grande taille. De mani\u00e8re concomitante, une accumulation d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine est observ\u00e9e dans la colonne inter-mediolat\u00e9rale de la m\u0153lle-\u00e9pini\u00e8re et dans le noyau dorso-m\u00e9dial du vague sans perte cellulaire puis, apr\u00e8s 3\u00a0mois de traitement, une accumulation d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et une perte des neurones dopaminergiques sont mis en \u00e9vidence dans la substantia nigra. La perte neuronale et l\u2019accumulation d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 un effet syst\u00e9mique, sont s\u00e9quentielles, mises en \u00e9vidence uniquement dans les r\u00e9gions connect\u00e9es, accompagn\u00e9es de stigmates d\u2019inflammation et se traduisant par une atteinte clinique motrice qui appara\u00eet seulement au bout de 3\u00a0mois. \n\nEnfin, un autre facteur d\u00e9clenchant pourrait \u00eatre une contamination par l\u2019agent causal lui-m\u00eame qui serait constitu\u00e9 d\u2019assemblage d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pr\u00e9sent dans l\u2019environnement. La contamination pourrait \u00eatre interhumaine lors de soins m\u00e9dicaux ou lors de proc\u00e9dures chirurgicales comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 dans les ESST. Cependant, aucun argument \u00e9pid\u00e9miologique n\u2019existe actuellement en faveur d\u2019une telle hypoth\u00e8se. Une autre possibilit\u00e9 serait une contamination \u00e0 partir d\u2019animaux atteints mais il n\u2019est pas certain qu\u2019il existe parmi les animaux consomm\u00e9s de cas naturels de maladie de Parkinson. De plus, les mesures mises en place depuis le milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990\u00a0apr\u00e8s les premiers cas de variante de la MCJ (retrait des mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 risques sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s comme le SNC et les intestins chez les ruminants) ont grandement limit\u00e9 l\u2019exposition \u00e0 des pathog\u00e8nes associ\u00e9s aux tissus nerveux y compris le syst\u00e8me nerveux autonome. \n\n\n## Arguments en d\u00e9faveur d\u2019une progression \u00ab\u00a0prion-like\u00a0\u00bb au cours de la maladie de Parkinson \n  \nLe sc\u00e9nario de progression de la maladie de Parkinson d\u00e9crit par Braak et al., clair et st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9 avec un d\u00e9but par le tube digestif et une progression trans-synaptique du processus pathologique jusqu\u2019au SNC, est encore d\u00e9battu. Si la qualit\u00e9 et l\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9 des marquages immunohistochimiques ne font que peu de doute, la s\u00e9lection des cas et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des donn\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre discut\u00e9es. Ainsi, dans son \u00e9tude princeps publi\u00e9e en 2003, Braak et al. rapportent que la totalit\u00e9 des 41\u00a0patients atteints de maladie de Parkinson dont le cerveau a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 ont des l\u00e9sions dans le noyau dorsal moteur du vague  . Ceci combin\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de corps de Lewy dans le noyau dorsal moteur du vague chez 69/69\u00a0des sujets indemnes de maladie de Parkinson, l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que le noyau dorsal moteur du vague \u00e9tait un passage oblig\u00e9 du processus pathologique. Cependant, les crit\u00e8res de s\u00e9lection de ces 69\u00a0sujets parmi une large s\u00e9rie de cerveaux de sujets sans signes moteurs \u00e9vocateurs de syndrome parkinsonien, mais qui pr\u00e9sentaient des corps de Lewy \u00e0 l\u2019analyse microscopique ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s. Un biais de s\u00e9lection ne peut donc pas \u00eatre formellement \u00e9limin\u00e9. Il en va de m\u00eame pour l\u2019article publi\u00e9 3\u00a0ans plus tard par la m\u00eame \u00e9quipe sur l\u2019atteinte pr\u00e9coce du SNE chez les patients parkinsoniens qui reposait sur la description pathologique pr\u00e9cise du SNE et du SNC chez 5\u00a0sujets s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s  . Depuis ces publications des s\u00e9ries neuropathologiques ont montr\u00e9 qu\u2019une proportion non n\u00e9gligeables de cas ne suivaient pas la pr\u00e9diction de progression rostro-caudale propos\u00e9e par Braak. Sur 71\u00a0cas analys\u00e9s, Kalaitzakis et al. ont montr\u00e9 que 22\u00a0sujets avaient une atteinte s\u00e9v\u00e8re de la substantia nigra avec peu ou pas d\u2019atteinte du noyau dorsal moteur vague  . Ces donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9es par une \u00e9tude ind\u00e9pendante publi\u00e9e la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e  . \n\nLes deux publications originales des \u00e9quipes de Brundin et Kordower montrant la pr\u00e9sence de corps de Lewy (CL) et de neurites de Lewy (NL) dans certains neurones embryonnaires transplant\u00e9s ont re\u00e7u un large \u00e9cho. Il est toutefois important de contrebalancer les r\u00e9sultats de ces \u00e9tudes par ceux de l\u2019\u00e9quipe d\u2019Ole Isacson qui est plus circonspecte quant au r\u00f4le \u00e9ventuel d\u2019un passage de neurone \u00e0 neurone de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine dans la diffusion de la maladie. En analysant les cerveaux de 5\u00a0patients parkinsoniens transplant\u00e9s 9\u00a0\u00e0 14\u00a0ans auparavant, ils n\u2019ont pas mis en \u00e9vidence de signes de neurod\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence ni de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine dans les neurones greff\u00e9s  . Bien qu\u2019ils n\u2019excluent pas que des corps de Lewy puissent \u00eatre trouv\u00e9s dans les neurones greff\u00e9s, ils incitent \u00e0 la prudence en sugg\u00e9rant qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne rare et qui ne leur semble pas \u00eatre impliqu\u00e9 dans la diffusion du processus pathologique. \n\nNous l\u2019avons vu, de nombreuses exp\u00e9riences de biologie cellulaire sont venues appuyer l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019un passage de neurone \u00e0 neurone de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. Il convient l\u00e0 aussi de garder un \u0153il critique car m\u00eame si les exp\u00e9riences propos\u00e9es sont globalement convaincantes, elles ne sont pas exemptes de critiques. Cet aspect a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment discut\u00e9 dans une excellente revue qui souligne les limites de ces exp\u00e9riences dont certaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es avec des agents de lipofection pour favoriser le passage transmembranaire de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine ou chez des souris transg\u00e9niques qui sur-expriment massivement l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine humaine et qui sont bien loin de ce qui peut \u00eatre observ\u00e9 en physiopathologie humaine (revue dans  ). \n\n\n## Implications th\u00e9rapeutiques et diagnostiques \n  \nL\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine agr\u00e9g\u00e9e se propagerait selon un mode   prion-like   permet d\u2019envisager de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s th\u00e9rapeutiques pour la maladie de Parkinson qui cibleraient directement l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi propos\u00e9 qu\u2019une diminution de l\u2019expression et/ou une augmentation de l\u2019\u00e9limination de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine pourraient permettre de ralentir l\u2019\u00e9volution de la maladie. Une autre strat\u00e9gie \u00ab\u00a0neuroprotectrice\u00a0\u00bb consisterait \u00e0 diminuer le niveau de phosphorylation de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et par la m\u00eame sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019agr\u00e9ger. Ces approches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9es dans des mod\u00e8les animaux de la maladie et se sont montr\u00e9es globalement efficaces (revue dans  ). Il est toutefois important d\u2019attendre les r\u00e9sultats chez l\u2019homme, les \u00e9tudes en cours n\u2019en \u00e9tant pour le moment qu\u2019\u00e0 une phase pr\u00e9coce  . \n\nL\u2019approche qui a re\u00e7u le plus d\u2019\u00e9cho est l\u2019utilisation d\u2019anticorps anti-\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour le peptide \u03b2-amylo\u00efde dans la maladie d\u2019Alzheimer. En effet, le m\u00e9canisme de propagation implique un passage extracellulaire des assemblages pathologiques qui serait alors plus facilement accessibles. Plusieurs groupes de recherche ont montr\u00e9 que l\u2019immunisation active ou passive contre l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine permettait de diminuer la charge l\u00e9sionnelle et am\u00e9liorait les performances motrices dans des mod\u00e8les de souris transg\u00e9niques de la maladie  ,  ,  . Une \u00e9tude pilote par immunisation active contre l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 \u00e0 32\u00a0patients parkinsoniens par une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de biotechnologie autrichienne (Protocole PD01\u00a0AFFITOPE, Clinical Trials  ). Cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape a permis de montrer que cette immunisation \u00e9tait bien support\u00e9e et qu\u2019aucun des patients n\u2019avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 d\u2019effets secondaires notables. D\u2019autres protocoles sont en cours avec une \u00e9valuation \u00e0 plus long terme sur l\u2019\u00e9volution de la maladie. \n\nEnfin, les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019amplification du mauvais repliement des prot\u00e9ines, qui ont montr\u00e9 leur int\u00e9r\u00eat dans le diagnostic des maladies \u00e0 prions  ,  , pourraient \u00eatre adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alpha-synucl\u00e9ine et fournir prochainement \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 neurologique des outils innovants et tr\u00e8s performants pour le diagnostic et le suivi des alpha-synucleinopathies. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nL\u2019implication de m\u00e9canismes de type prion dans la survenue et l\u2019aggravation progressive des maladies conformationnelles des prot\u00e9ines du SNC et notamment de la maladie de Parkinson est une avanc\u00e9e conceptuelle importante dans la compr\u00e9hension de la physiopathologie de ces maladies. Cependant, la cause initiale, et il pourrait s\u2019agir d\u2019un ensemble de facteurs (environnementaux, g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, cellulaires, li\u00e9s au vieillissement\u2026), entra\u00eenant le mauvais repliement et l\u2019agr\u00e9gation de la prot\u00e9ine cible demeure inconnue. Il en est de m\u00eame des m\u00e9canismes de diss\u00e9mination des prot\u00e9ines agr\u00e9g\u00e9es. La corr\u00e9lation entre les signes non moteurs pr\u00e9-symptomatiques et la diffusion s\u00e9quentielle et pr\u00e9dictive de l\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine, selon le mod\u00e8le de Braak, font de la maladie de Parkinson un mod\u00e8le tr\u00e8s pertinent, non seulement pour l\u2019\u00e9tude de ces m\u00e9canismes, mais aussi pour tester des traitements sp\u00e9cifiques ciblant les assemblages d\u2019\u03b1-synucl\u00e9ine et leur propagation d\u00e8s la phase pr\u00e9-motrice de la maladie. Il faut enfin insister sur le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019existe actuellement aucun argument permettant de suspecter un risque de transmission interhumaine de la maladie de Parkinson. \n\n\n## D\u00e9claration de liens d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \n  \nLes auteurs d\u00e9clarent ne pas avoir de liens d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7111738, "text_md5": "70f5632a855d9ce97b6918cb62591d4d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 67], "journal": [68, 86], "publication_year": [88, 92], "title": [103, 157], "keywords": [171, 258], "abstract": [271, 1758], "body": [1767, 53235]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26563663, "doi": "10.1016/j.neurol.2015.10.005", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111738", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7111738"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111738\">7111738</a>", "list_title": "PMC7111738  La maladie de Parkinson est-elle une maladie \u00e0 prion\u00a0?"}

Hippocampal neuroplasticity is altered in PD animal models, resulting in nonmotor dysfunctions. However, little is known about the precise mechanism underlying the hippocampal dysfunctions in PD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nStriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusions were performed unilaterally in adult Sprague Dawley rats. Both motor and nonmotor symptoms alongside the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the   substantia nigra   and striatum were confirmed in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. The neuronal architecture in the hippocampus was analyzed by Golgi staining. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nDuring the 7\u20138 weeks after infusion, the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited motor and nonmotor dysfunctions (especially anxiety/depression-like behaviors). Rats with unilateral 6-OHDA infusion displayed reduced TH+ immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral nigrostriatal pathway of the brain. Golgi staining revealed that striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly decreased the dendritic complexity (i.e., number of crossing dendrites, total dendritic length, and branch points) in the ipsilateral hippocampal conus ammonis 1 (CA1) apical/basal and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions. Additionally, the dendritic spine density and morphology were significantly altered in the CA1 apical/basal and DG subregions following striatal 6-OHDA infusion. However, alteration of microglial and astrocytic distributions did not occur in the hippocampus following striatal 6-OHDA infusion. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present study provides anatomical evidence that the structural plasticity in the hippocampus is altered in the late phase following striatal 6-OHDA infusion in rats, possibly as a result of the prolonged suppression of the DAergic system, and independent of neuroinflammation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## \u2022 HIGHLIGHTS \n  \n- Striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusion induced behavioral dysfunctions and reduced DAergic signaling in rat brains. \n\n- Structural plasticity is altered in the hippocampus of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. \n\n- Hippocampal dysfunctions may be related to the alteration of structural plasticity in Parkinson disease animal models, possibly by a decrease in DAergic signaling. \n\n\n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the world\u2019s second most common neurodegenerative disorder [ ]. It is distinguished by a significant loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons, primarily in the   substantia nigra   (SN), and results in a decrease in DAergic fibers in the striatum [ ]. Additionally, PD is a neurological disease that causes both motor and nonmotor symptoms [ ]. The main clinical focus in PD has been on motor symptoms; nevertheless, there is growing acknowledgment that the clinical spectrum of PD is more comprehensive, and includes nonmotor functions [ ]. The most prevalent nonmotor symptoms in PD are depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, pain, fatigue, insomnia, and autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, approximately 40%\u201350% of PD patients are diagnosed with anxiety or depression [ ]. Moreover, the nonmotor symptoms that are associated with the hippocampus significantly affect PD patients\u2019 quality of life [ ]. \n\nSince DAergic damage is a defining characteristic of PD, the structural, molecular, and functional alterations in the nigrostriatal system have garnered much attention [ ]. However, research on the other brain regions in PD is needed to clarify their roles, their interaction with the nigrostriatal system, and their involvement in the mechanism underlying nonmotor dysfunctions. The hippocampus is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and receives DAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area and SN, respectively [ ]. Dopamine (DA) modulates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) [ ]. In PD, the DAergic system interacts with the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus [ ], and the hippocampus is implicated in the nonmotor dysfunctions of PD [ ]. In preclinical PD studies, synaptic mechanisms underlying hippocampal dysfunction were reported in neurotoxic and genetic animal models of PD, including 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats [ ] and \u03b1-synuclein transgenic mice [ ], respectively. \n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the capacity of neuronal networks in the brain that change through development and reorganization; it is typically classified as structural and functional plasticity [ , ]. Structural plasticity, such as dendritic formation and spine development, is controlled by the regulation of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton [ ]. Neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by dendritic and spine alterations produced by acute or chronic disruptions in brain tissue homeostasis [ ]. Structural plasticity in the hippocampus can be influenced by a variety of stimuli, some of which appear to have long-term effects [ ]. Previous studies found that dendritic complexity and/or spine density was altered in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned [ , ] and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-mutant mouse PD models [ , ]. However, many questions remain unanswered about the functional and structural changes of hippocampal neurons that occur in PD. In this study, a hemiparkinsonian rat model with an ipsilaterally striatal infusion of 6-OHDA was used, which mimics features of the human pathological condition of PD [ ]. Therefore, this study attempted to analyze behavioral impairments and alteration of structural plasticity in the hippocampus, as well as explain their correlations in this animal model. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Animals and Surgical Procedure \n  \nMale Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013300 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) at 8 weeks old and allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to use in the study. The rats were immobilized in a stereotaxic device (SR-6; NARISHIGE, Tokyo, Japan) with a flat head position after anesthesia. The coordinates were as follows: anteroposterior, +1.3, +0.4, -0.4, -1.3 mm from the bregma; mediolateral, -2.6, -3.0, -4.2, -4.5 mm from the midline; and dorsoventral, -5.0, respectively, from the skull. Per rat: the 6-OHDA (3.5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was administered into the right striatum with an infusion pump using an 8 \u00b5l saline with 0.02% (w/v) ascorbic acid (Wako, Osaka, Japan) through a 10.5-\u03bcL microinjection cannula at a continuous flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min (2 \u03bcL was injected at each coordinate). Sham-operated rats were subjected to the identical method, except instead of 6-OHDA, 8 \u03bcL of the vehicle (0.9% saline containing 0.02% (w/v) ascorbic acid) was injected into the striatum. \n\n\n### Behavioral Analysis of Motor Symptoms \n  \n#### Apomorphine-induced rotation test \n  \nFour weeks after striatal 6-OHDA infusion, apomorphine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg; Wako) was given intraperitoneally into the rats. The number of left-handed (contralateral) rotations was monitored for 30 minutes. Hemiparkinsonian rat models for PD were found to have a rotational velocity of more than 7 turns/min. \n\n\n#### Open field test \n  \nThe equipment was made from an acrylic chamber (width [W]\u00d7depth [D]\u00d7height [H]: 60\u00d760\u00d730 cm). The rats were carefully placed in the center of the open field. Using SmartScan (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain), the proportion of entries and duration in the total movement time (s), total distance traveled (cm), and margin time (s) were calculated over 30 minutes. \n\n\n#### Cylinder test \n  \nThe test was performed as follows: individual rats were placed within a glass cylinder (diameter, 22 cm; height, 26 cm) with one mirror set below the cylinder at a 45\u00b0 angle to provide 360\u00b0 viewing. The rats were videotaped for 5 minutes following initial contact with the walls of the cylinder with their impaired, unimpaired, or both forelimbs. The scores were computed using the asymmetry ratio, left-right/(right + left + both). The forelimb asymmetry ratio scores vary from 1 to 1. The positive ratio indicates that the unimpaired forelimb is utilized more than the impaired forelimb. The negative asymmetry ratio shows that the impaired forelimb is used more than the unimpaired forelimb. \n\n\n\n### Behavioral Analysis of Nonmotor Symptoms \n  \n#### Object exploration test \n  \nIn the center of the open box (W\u00d7D\u00d7H: 60\u00d760\u00d730 cm), a cylinder item (diameter, 5.5 cm; height, 13 cm) was exposed. A rat was placed in the open box with its back to the test object and given 10 minutes to explore. The time it took for a rat to approach an object and the duration of each subsequent approach were recorded. \n\n\n#### Light/dark box test \n  \nRats were examined in 2 compartments (W\u00d7D\u00d7H: 60\u00d730\u00d730 cm), which were connected together length-wise. There was a 10\u00d710 cm square aperture between the 2 compartments that the rat could utilize and move between. One chamber was closed with a lid (i.e., the dark box), whereas the other was white, left uncovered, and illuminated with an 880-lux light (i.e., the light box). Again, the rat was allowed 10 minutes to explore both chambers. Here, both the frequency of entry and the duration spent in the light box were calculated. \n\n\n#### Forced swim test \n  \nThis test exposed the rats to a cylindrical container (diameter, 20 cm; height, 70 cm) containing water at a temperature of 24\u00b0C\u00b11\u00b0C and a depth of 30 cm. The duration of time the rat floated upright without moving or \u2018struggling\u2019\u2014aside from efforts to maintain its head above water\u2014was known as the time spent in immobility. \n\n\n\n### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nAll immunohistochemistry methods were followed as described in previous studies [ , ]. The fixed brain hemispheres were sectioned in the coronal plane to a 30-\u00b5m thickness. To inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity, free-floating sections were incubated in 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes before being blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Vector ABC Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 hour at room temperature (RT; 22\u00b0C\u00b12\u00b0C). Sections were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:500; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:2,000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), or the rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; 1:1,000; Wako, Osaka, Japan). Sections were incubated for 1 hour at RT with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector ABC Elite Kit), and then incubated for 1 hour at RT with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector ABC Elite Kit). The peroxidase reaction was induced using a diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB kit; Vector Laboratories). \n\nThree hemisections of the SN (approximately 5.08 mm caudally from the bregma) were selected from each rat for cell counting. The mean number of immunopositive cells in the 3 sections of each rat was taken as n=1. Moreover, the images were converted to grayscale to measure TH immunoreactivity in the striatum (approximately 0.26 mm caudally from the bregma) alongside GFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivities in the hippocampus (approximately 3.80 mm caudally from the bregma). The mean gray value (256 gray levels) was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) for each chosen area. The relative changes in intensity levels of TH+, GFAP+, and Iba1+ immunoreactivities were expressed as relative to their optical densities (ODs) after setting the mean intensity of the control to 1. The number and intensity of the immunopositive cells per group were averaged and expressed as mean \u00b1standard error (SE; n=3 rats/group). \n\n\n### Western Blotting \n  \nAll Western blot protocols were followed as described in previous studies [ , ]. Electrophoresis was used to separate proteins on 7%\u201315% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then blocked for 1 hour at RT with 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2% (v/v) NGS (Vector Laboratories) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS\u2010T; pH 7.4). The membranes were subsequently treated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-GFAP (1:2,000) and Iba1 (1:1,000) primary antibodies. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour at RT, and the signals were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal West Pico; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After stripping, the membranes were probed again with the mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:5,000; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 2 hours at RT. The OD of each band was assessed using an iBright CL750 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). \n\n\n### Golgi Staining \n  \nThe dendritic complexity, spine density, and spine morphology of the neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and DG subregions were studied using Golgi impregnation. The FD Rapid Golgistain Kit and accompanying techniques were employed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines (FD Neurotechnologies, Ellicott City, MD, USA). \n\n\n### Sholl Analysis \n  \nAs previously reported [ , ], both CA1 and DG neurons of the hippocampus were traced and analyzed. Using a camera lucida at a magnification of 200\u00d7, 10 neurons from each hippocampal region were randomly dispersed among 3 brain slices (approximately 3.80 mm behind bregma) in each animal. Sholl\u2019s concentric circle method [ , ] was used to objectively examine the dendrites for each of the chosen neurons. Dendrites intersecting each circle were counted to determine the number of dendritic intersections at different radial distances from the neuronal soma, in addition to the total dendritic length, and branch points. Each value was averaged per rat, and the mean value of each rat was taken as n=1. The value per group was averaged and expressed as mean\u00b1SE (n=8 rats/group). \n\n\n### Measurement of Spine Density and Morphology \n  \nAll discernible projecting dendritic spines were counted along 30-\u00b5m dendritic segments from the terminal to the tip of 3 dendrites from each neuron using 1,500\u00d7 magnification. Spines were divided into the following morphological categories: (1) thin: spines with a discernible small head and an extended neck, (2) mushroom: spines with a voluminous head and a noticeable neck, and (3) stubby: spines with an overall stubby look and no discernible neck. Ten segments were counted in each animal (n=8 rats/group), and the spine density was determined as the number of spines per 10 \u00b5m of dendritic length. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA; RRID: SCR_002798). The changes between the number of dendritic intersections at different radial distances of the sham-operated controls and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were identified, for 8 rats per group, using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison tests corrected with \u0160id\u0103k\u2019s   post hoc   test. Unpaired Student t-tests were used for all other analyses to compare the means of the sham-operated controls and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. For all statistical tests, a P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Striatal 6-OHDA Infusion Induced Motor dysfunctions and Deceased TH+ Immunoreactivity in the Nigrostriatal Pathway \n  \nInitially, motor impairments and nigrostriatal DAergic degradation in the study\u2019s hemiparkinsonian rat model were confirmed. At 4 weeks postsurgery, rats having >7 rotations/min due to apomorphine treatment (n=15 rats/group) were regarded as effectively induced hemiparkinsonian models (t(28) =26.32; P<0.0001) ( ). At 6 weeks postsurgery, the cylinder test (n=10 rats/group) showed that right-side hemiparkinsonian rats exhibited a significantly reduced use of the left forelimb, resulting in an ~60% decrease in the left/right ratio of forelimb usage (t(18)=7.431, P<0.0001) ( ). Locomotor activity in the open field (n=13 rats/group) revealed that rats with unilaterally striatal 6-OHDA infusion display a significantly lower total distance traveled (t(24)=5.014, P<0.05) and total movement time (t(24)=2.340, P<0.0001) than the sham-operated controls ( ). Additionally, the TH+ immunoreactivity in the   substantia nigra   and stratum were examined to validate the suppression of the ipsilateral DAergic signal pathway caused by unilateral 6-OHDA infusion ( ). The lesion extent measurement using TH+ cell immunoreactivity revealed significant deterioration in the ipsilateral   substantia nigra   (t(4)=8.409, P<0.01) and striatum (t(4)=14.11, P<0.0001). \n\n\n### Striatal 6-OHDA Infusion Induced Anxiety and Depression-Like Behaviors in Rats \n  \nSince anxiety and depression are significant nonmotor features of PD [ ], anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were assessed in hemiparkinsonian rats. We employed several paradigms for those behaviors, including the open field test, object exploration, light/dark box test, and the forced swim test ( ). In the open field test (n=13 rats/group), the margin in distance traveled and total distance traveled (%) was significantly increased in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (t(24)=2.622, P<0.05) ( ). Additionally, the total number of occurrences (approaching frequency) in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was significantly lower than in sham-operated controls (t(26)=2.862, P<0.01) in the object exploration test (n=13 rats/group,  ). The total duration time (approaching time) was significantly shorter in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats than in the sham-operated controls (t(26)=2.362, P<0.05). The 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had fewer entries into the illuminated compartment (t(12) =3.417, P <0.01) and spent less time in the light box compartment (t(12) =2.983, P <0.05) in the light/dark box test (n =7 rats/group,  ). Finally, the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats displayed a longer immobility time (considered an index of depression) compared to sham-operated controls (t(20)=4.352, P<0.001) in the forced swim test (n=11 rats/group,  ). \n\n\n### 6-OHDA-Lesioned Rats Displayed Significant Reduction in Dendritic Arborization of Hippocampal Neurons in the CA1 and DG Subregions \n  \nEight weeks following the striatal 6-OHDA infusion, Golgi staining was used to track and quantify the dendritic complexity of the ipsilateral CA1 and DG neurons. The number of dendritic intersections was counted at various radial distances from the neuronal soma using Sholl analysis ( ,  , n=8 rats/group). At Sholl radii of 30\u2013170 \u00b5m from the soma, the CA1 apical dendrites in the hippocampi of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had significantly fewer intersections than those in sham-operated controls ( , left panel; F  [34, 2652]=10.44, P<0.0001). The number of branching points in the CA1 apical dendrites in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was significantly lower than in sham-operated controls ( , middle panel; t(14)=8.317, P<0.0001). Moreover, striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly reduced the total length of the CA1 apical dendrite in the hippocampi of rats ( , right panel: t(14)=3.394, P<0.01). In the hippocampal CA1 basal, the dendrites in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had fewer intersections than those in sham-operated controls at Sholl radii of 20\u2013110 \u00b5m from the soma ( , left panel; F  [20, 1,560]=9.049, P<0.0001). Striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly decreased both the number of branch points ( , middle panel; t(14)=7.353, P<0.0001) and the total length ( , right panel; t(14)=3.265, P<0.01) of the CA1 basal dendrites in rat hippocampi. \n\nFurther, the neuronal dendrites in the hippocampal DG of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited fewer intersections than the sham-operated controls at Sholl radii of 20\u2013150 \u00b5m from the soma ( , left panel; F  [24, 1,872]=10.45, P<0.0001). The dendritic branch points ( , middle panel; t(14)=4.458, P <0.001) and total dendritic length ( , right panel; t(14)=4.344, P<0.001) of DG neurons were significantly different between the sham-operated controls and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. \n\n\n### Striatal 6-OHDA Infusion Significantly Altered Dendritic Spine Density and Morphology in the Hippocampal CA1 and DG Subregions \n  \nThe Golgi-stained neurons were magnified and their dendritic spine density and morphology were analyzed for any alterations ( \u2013 , left panels). The dendritic spine densities (the number of spines per 10-\u03bcm dendrite) were significantly decreased in the apical CA1 ( , middle panel; t(14)=3.158, P<0.01), basal CA1 ( , middle panel; t(14)=3.397, P<0.01), and DG ( , middle panel; t(14)=2.183, P<0.05) of the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. \n\nMoreover, variations in the proportion of dendritic morphology were found in the subregions of the hippocampus. The proportion of thin spines (% in 10-\u03bcm dendrite) was significantly increased in the CA1 apical ( , right panel; t(14)= 3.8, P<0.01) and DG subregions ( , right panel; t(14)=4.9, P<0.001) in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Conversely, the proportion of mushroom spines was significantly decreased in the CA1 apical ( , right panel; t(14)=2.7, P<0.05) and DG subregions ( , right panel; t(14)=5.3, P<0.001) in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. However, there is no significant difference in the proportion of the CA1 basal dendrites spine morphology between sham-operated controls and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats ( , right panel). \n\n\n### Striatal 6-OHDA Infusion Did Not Activate Microglia and Astrocytes in the Ipsilateral Hippocampi \n  \nWestern blot analysis illustrated no significant differences in protein levels of GFAP (t(6) =0.5705, P =0.5890) and Iba-1 (t(6)=0.4892, P=0.6421) in the hippocampi ( ). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression intensities of GFAP (t(4) =0.0879, P =0.9342) and Iba-1 (t(4) =0.2757, P =0.7964) in the hippocampus were unaffected by striatal 6-OHDA infusion ( ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, unilaterally striatal 6-OHDA infusion produced persistent motor (hypolocomotion and asymmetric behavioral deficit) and nonmotor (anxiety/depression-like behaviors) symptoms. Additionally, it induced the destruction of DAergic signaling in the ipsilateral nigrostriatal pathway of rats; identified through the loss of TH+ neurons in the SN and TH+ fibers in the striatum. Intriguingly, the striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly altered neuronal architecture (dendritic complexity alongside spine density and morphology) in the ipsilateral hippocampus and independently of neuroinflammation. \n\nPathological characteristics of PD include nigrostriatal DAergic degradation, which affects motor function [ ]. Asymmetries in sensorimotor reactivity beginning 6 weeks [ ] and impairments in motor coordination and balance abilities at 2 weeks [ ] are the most noticeable deficiencies observed in unilateral 6-OHDA-infused rats. Indeed, in this study, rats with striatal 6-OHDA infusion were subjected to a complete evaluation of PD-like behaviors utilizing multiple behavioral paradigms for assessing motor and nonmotor symptoms. Similar to previous studies [ ], the present study uncovered noteworthy anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats infused unilaterally with 6-OHDA. Therefore, we found that striatal 6-OHDA infusion generated both motor and nonmotor dysfunctions, including anxiety/depression-like behaviors, which are associated with hippocampal dysfunctions. \n\nDA affects hippocampal LTP [ ] along with hippocampus-dependent learning and memory [ ]. The hippocampus is implicated in the nonmotor dysfunctions of PD [ ], and hippocampal neuroplasticity interacts with the DAergic system in PD [ ]. Here, we focused on the modification of structural plasticity in the hippocampus of PD. In this study, striatal 6-OHDA infusion significantly decreased the dendritic complexity and spine density in the ipsilateral hippocampus, suggesting that the destruction of DAergic signaling downregulates structural plasticity in a hippocampus with PD. Additionally, striatal 6-OHDA infusion altered the morphology of spines on hippocampal dendrites (thin spines increased and mushroom spines decreased), which suggests that impaired spine maturation may lead to a decrease in postsynaptic density and excitatory neurotransmission [ ]. There are several possible mechanisms underlying the alteration of structural plasticity in the hippocampus after striatal 6-OHDA infusion. Mesencephalic DAergic neurons project to the limbic system, including the hippocampus, whilst it is known that DA receptors regulate cognition-related and synaptic plasticity-related processes in the hippocampus [ ]. Indeed, Janakiraman et al. [ ] discovered a decrease in DA and serotonin levels in the hippocampus following a chronic MPTP regimen. Furthermore, DA promotes dendritic growth, and DAergic deficiency leads to shorter dendrites and a lower spine density in the nucleus accumbens [ ]. Thus, this study suggests that prolonged DA depletion may alter structural plasticity in the hippocampus. These findings might point to interactions between DAergic transmission and hippocampal neuroplasticity for nonmotor symptoms in PD. \n\nAccording to a previous study, neuroinflammation is potentially one of the key causes that leads to synaptic and cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative diseases [ ]. Microglia and astrocytes are activated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, Alzheimer disease, and multiple sclerosis [ ]. Activated microglia and astrocytes may play potentially detrimental roles by eliciting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [ ]. However, neither microglial nor astrocytic activation was found in the hippocampus following striatal 6-OHDA infusion in this study. Ultimately, this indicates that neuroinflammation does not necessarily promote the decrease of structural plasticity and hippocampal dysfunction. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing demonstrated no significant alterations in neuroinflammation-related genes in the hippocampus between sham-operated controls and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (data not shown). \n\nOverall, rats with striatal 6-OHDA infusion displayed motor and nonmotor symptoms as well as nigrostriatal DA degeneration. In addition, striatal 6-OHDA infusion affected dendritic complexity along with spine density, and morphology in the ipsilateral hippocampus of rats. These findings demonstrate that in a PD animal model, inhibiting the DAergic pathway causes changes to the neuronal architecture in the hippocampus, independently of neuroinflammation. Consequently, this study provides anatomical evidence that structural plasticity in the hippocampus may play a role in the etiology of the nonmotor hallmarks of PD. Nonetheless, further research is required to establish the alterations in other neuroplasticity-related signals in the hippocampus in PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9767684, "text_md5": "9752d66ee97b9c3a2633aeedfbe38f50", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 223], "journal": [224, 239], "publication_year": [241, 245], "title": [256, 374], "keywords": [388, 498], "abstract": [511, 2483], "body": [2492, 27277]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 36503212, "doi": "10.5213/inj.2244252.126", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9767684", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9767684"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9767684\">9767684</a>", "list_title": "PMC9767684  Changes in the Neuronal Architecture of the Hippocampus in a 6-Hydroxydopamine-Lesioned Rat Model of Parkinson Disease"}

This phenomenon is originated from uneven degeneration of bilateral substantia nigra. However, this asymmetry may not restrict to substantia nigra or striatum. We aimed to determine the effect of asymmetry on spontaneous brain activity across the whole brain. \n\n Methods:   We consecutively recruited 71 patients with PD, as well as 35 healthy controls, and collected relevant demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological information. The PD patients were divided into two groups according to the side of motor symptom onset. All the participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and spontaneous brain activity was assessed using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). The associations between areas showing significant group differences and various clinical and neuropsychological measures were analyzed. \n\n Results:   Finally, the data of 30 PD patients with left-onset (LPD), 27 PD patients with right-onset (RPD), and 32 healthy controls were obtained. The three groups had similar age and gender ratios. Our results demonstrated that LPD patients had increased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus and decreased ALFF in bilateral thalamus and cerebellum anterior lobes than the control group. The value of ALFF of the left inferior temporal gyrus was correlated with motor function, and ALFF value of the thalamus was associated with cognition. Comparisons between LPD and RPD patients and between RPD patients and the controls did not yield significant difference. \n\n Conclusions:   The present study provides new insights into the distinct characteristics of spontaneous brain activity in LPD, which may be associated with motor and cognitive function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder and manifests as motor symptoms including bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, as well as a series of non-motor symptoms ( ). One enigmatic characteristic of PD is the asymmetry of motor symptoms, which presents since disease onset and persists along with disease progression ( ,  ). This asymmetry of motor symptoms is unique among various neurodegenerative disorders with parkinsonian syndromes and can serve as a clue for differential diagnosis ( ). The mechanism underlying motor symptoms asymmetry is the unequal degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and consistently revealed through autopsy, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission tomography examinations ( \u2013 ). \n\nFurthermore, motor asymmetry also affects non-motor profiles, such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, pain, sleep disorders, and olfactory function ( \u2013 ). Regarding cognitive function, patients with right-sided PD (RPD) typically have language-related impairments, whereas patients with left-sided PD (LPD) mainly have visuospatial-associated dysfunction ( ). The mechanism how lateralization influences non-motor symptoms is still elusive. Unequal impairments of bilateral dopaminergic circuits might partially underlie this phenomenon; more widespread destructions involving multiple brain areas may also account for the impact of lateralization on various non-motor symptoms ( ,  ). \n\nA variety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques contributes to our improved understanding on structural and functional asymmetric impairment of the brain in PD. A longitudinal study demonstrated that the lateral ventricular volume contralateral to motor symptom onset increased faster than that ipsilateral to motor symptoms onset ( ). Magnetic resonance imaging using voxel-based morphometry has revealed that LPD patients had gray matter volume loss primarily in the right hemisphere ( ). Diffusion tensor imaging has shown that the substantial nigra contralateral to the side with more severe symptoms had a larger decrease in fractional anisotropy than the opposite side ( ). Functional MRI (fMRI) is a valuable tool for the revelation of brain activity and has been used in the exploration of functional substrate of asymmetrical impairment in PD. \n\nFunctional MRI can be classified into task-based fMRI and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). The former requires the subject to perform a specific task; the latter needs almost no effort from the patient ( ). To date, there have been only few studies employing rs-fMRI in the topic of asymmetry of PD. Tang et al. ( ) used whole-brain functional connectivity in mild\u2013moderate PD patients and found that RPD patients had more functional connectivity abnormalities, especially in the brain regions of the left hemisphere belonging to the somatosensory and motor networks, as well as the default mode network. Another study using rs-fMRI analyzed the associations between brain functional connectivity and PD symptoms. They found that Movement Disorder Society (MDS)\u2013Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) part I score was correlated with functional connectivity centered in the inferior orbitofrontal area ipsilateral to the side of more severe motor symptoms, and MDS-UPDRS part III score was correlated with functional connectivity of inferior parietal contralateral to the side of more severe motor symptoms ( ). Huang et al. ( ) assessed regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the striatum as a measure of brain activity and tested the PD patients' feedback-based associative learning. In their study, LPD patients performed worse than did RPD patients and controls, and this cognitive impairment was associated with ReHo in the right dorsal rostral putamen ( ). Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is a widely used measure that conveniently reflects regional spontaneous activities of the whole human brain ( ). Previous studies on PD using ALFF have indicated that the changes in brain function did not restrict to basal ganglia, but also involved various cerebral areas ( ,  ). However, these studies combined LPD and RPD patients as a single group and thus could not reveal differences between spontaneous brain activities of these two subgroups. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the influence of motor asymmetry on brain activities in PD with the help ALFF. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFrom 2012 to 2014, we consecutively enrolled 71 patients with idiopathic PD, and 35 age-, sex-, and general cognitive status\u2013matched controls with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All the patients were diagnosed according to the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society brain bank diagnostic criteria ( ). \n\nDemographic and clinical information was collected from all the participants. Side of motor symptom onset was determined by medical history and confirmed by neurological examinations. The patients whose side of onset could not be ascertained would be excluded. Patients with dementia, moderate to severe head tremor, head trauma, deep brain stimulation, alcohol or drug abuse, or with other neurological or psychiatric disorders were excluded. Participants who were left-handed were also excluded from this study. \n\nAll the PD patients underwent MRI examination and motor and non-motor function evaluations in a practically defined \u201coff\u201d state, after withdrawing all the antiparkinsonian medications for ~12 h. UPDRS, Hoehn-Yahr staging, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQ) were assessed in all the PD patients. The control subjects were evaluated by MMSE. \n\nThe study was in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Hospital. This study was carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All the subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nAll the MRI scans were performed on a 3.0-T scanner (Achieva TX; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) at Beijing Hospital. Foam padding and headphones were used to minimize head motion and reduce scanning noise. Participants were asked to lie still, relax, keep their eyes closed, and remain awake through the entire scan. High-resolution T1-weighted images (three-dimensional turbo field echo) were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 7.4 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.0 ms, flip angle = 8\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 240 \u00d7 240 mm, matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256, voxel dimensions = 0.94 \u00d7 0.94 \u00d7 1.20 mm, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, 140 slices. Functional images were obtained using axial echo-planar imaging with the following parameters: TR = 3,000 ms, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 90\u00b0, FOV = 240 \u00d7 240 mm, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, voxel dimensions 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 4.00 mm, slice thickness = 4 mm, slices = 33, time points = 210. \n\n\n### rs-fMRI Data Preprocessing \n  \nResting-state fMRI data preprocessing and ALFF computation were carried out using RESTplus V 1.2 ( ), which is a toolkit based on SPM 12 ( ). Generally, the preprocessing pipeline included (1) the first 10 volumes were discarded for participants' acclimatization and signal equilibrium. (2) The remaining 200 time points were corrected for slice-timing. (3) Realignment to account for head motion. Subjects were excluded if their head motion exceeded 2 mm in displacement or 2\u00b0 in rotation. (4) Functional images were coregistered to the structural T1 images and were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template using the coregistered T1 images (by DARTEL) ( ). Then they were resliced to a resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm . (5) Smoothing using a Gaussian kernel (6-mm full-width-half-maximum, FWHM). (6) Detrending was employed to reduce the systematic shift. (7) Nuisance covariates regression, which regressed out Friston-24 head motion parameters ( ), white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals. \n\n\n### ALFF Calculations \n  \nAmplitude of low-frequency fluctuation was calculated using RESTplus V 1.2, and the algorithms have been published previously ( ). Briefly, the time series of all the voxels were converted to the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform. Then the power spectrum was obtained across the frequency of 0.01\u20130.1 Hz. Afterward, the ALFF value of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value for the standardization across participants. After the ALFF computation, band-pass filtering (0.01 <   f   < 0.1 Hz) was performed to remove the influences of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic and clinical variables were analyzed using SPSS (version 23.0; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation unless stated otherwise. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was applied to assess data normality. The one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was employed to test differences of numerical variables between the LPD, RPD, and control groups. \u03c7  or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups. Differences were considered statistically significant when   p   < 0.05. \n\nStatistical analysis of ALFF was performed using DPABI [Data Processing and Analysis for (Resting-State) Brain Imaging] V4.2 ( ). Comparisons between the LPD, RPD, and control groups were conducted using the analysis of covariance model. We used a gray matter mask and set age and gray matter density as covariates to control for the effects of age and structural differences.   Post-hoc   pairwise analyses were corrected by the least significant difference method. Multiple-comparisons corrections were performed based on Gaussian random field theory (voxel-level   P   < 0.001; cluster-level   P   < 0.05; two-tailed) ( ,  ). Effect sizes were evaluated using Cohen   f  , which was given by DPABI. We also calculated the statistical power for the clusters having significant between group differences using G Power 3.1.9.7 ( ). The ALFF values of clusters showing significant between group differences were extracted, and the relationship between the ALFF values of these positive clusters and clinical and neuropsychological variables was explored via Spearman correlation. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Information \n  \nFinally, we included 57 patients with PD and 32 controls. Four of the PD patients and two of the controls were excluded because of left-handedness. Five PD patients and one control were excluded because of excessive head motion. One PD patient was excluded because of poor image quality. Four PD patients were excluded because of bilateral motor symptom onset. \n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics are shown in  . There were 30, 27, and 32 subjects in the LPD, RPD, and controls groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, sex, or MMSE across the three groups. Disease duration was comparable in PD patients with left- and right-side onset. UPDRS, Hoehn-Yahr staging, HAMD, HAMA, and NMSQ scores were similar between the LPD and RPD groups. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the PD patients and controls. \n  \n\n### Group Differences in ALFF \n  \nAnalysis of covariance and the followed   post-hoc   pairwise analyses only identified different brain activities between the LPD and control groups, whereas there was no significant difference between the LPD and RPD groups, or between the RPD and control groups. \n\nLeft-sided PD patients exhibited increased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus ( ), as well as deceased ALFF in bilateral thalamus ( ) and cerebellum anterior lobes ( ), compared with the controls. The results are illustrated in  . \n  \nIncreased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus in the LPD patients compared with the controls.

There were three significant correlations: ALFF value of the inferior temporal gyrus was significantly correlated with scores of UPDRS parts II and III (  r   = 0.371, and 0.363;   p   =0.044 and 0.049, respectively); ALFF value of the thalamus was significantly associated with MMSE score (  r   = 0.496,   p   = 0.005). The degree of freedom of the correlation analysis was 28. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first study to investigate the pattern of spontaneous whole-brain activities in PD patients with left and right onset separately. Although directly comparing LPD and RPD patients did not identify significant different regional brain activities, only LPD patients had several areas with abnormal ALFF compared with healthy controls. LPD patients showed increased ALFF in the left inferior temporal lobe, as well as decreased ALFF in bilateral thalamus and cerebellum anterior lobes. Moreover, ALFF value of the left inferior temporal gyrus was associated with scores of activities of daily living and motor parts of UPDRS, and bilateral thalamus ALFF value was associated with cognitive function in the LPD group. \n\nComparing ALFF values with healthy controls obtained different results for LPD and RPD patients. This difference indicates that the pathological and compensatory mechanisms may be different in LPD and RPD patients. Some studies suggested that LPD and RPD might have different disease severity and speed of progression, and RPD patients had better neural reserve and/or greater neural plasticity than LPD patients ( ,  ). In addition, Kim et al. ( ) and Lee et al. ( ) also found that LPD patients had more areas of atrophy than RPD patients, when the two PD subgroups were compared with control subjects ( ,  ). These findings are in concordance with ours that the brains of RPD patients were less impaired than those of LPD patients. It is interesting to follow up the patients, to explore whether widespread aberrant brain activates in the LPD patients would translate to faster progression. The present study underscores the importance of dividing PD patients according to side of onset in future studies, to confirm their distinct brain activity characteristics. \n\nNevertheless, the direct comparison between LPD and RPD patients did not show significant difference. Moreover, the studies by Kim et al. ( ) and Lee et al. ( ) also failed to identify areas with significant different cortical thickness or gray matter volume in the direct comparison between LPD and RPD patients, although these two groups showed different patterns of abnormalities compared with the controls ( ,  ). We have to be cautious to assert that LPD and RPD have different profiles of brain activity. The mean disease duration was longer than 6 years, and the mean Hoehn-Yahr stage was higher than 2 in both PD groups in the present study. Therefore, most of the PD patients recruited already had bilateral brain impairments. The disparity between the two PD subgroups might be masked by prominent similarities. Although still in controversy, some studies demonstrated that the degree of asymmetry decreased during disease progression ( ,  ). Our findings should be considered preliminary results, and further studies including a larger sample and particularly patients with only unilateral symptoms may better reveal the influence of lateralization on cerebral activities in PD. \n\nThere were three regions with aberrant ALFF in the comparison between LPD patients and the controls. The Cohen   f  -values indicated medium effect sizes (0.15 <   f   < 0.35) ( ), and correlation analysis showed that the altered brain activity in these areas might play a role in motor and non-motor symptoms. \n\nLeft-sided PD patients had increased ALFF in the left inferior temporal lobe, and this abnormality was associated motor symptoms and daily activities. Increased ALFF in the left inferior temporal lobe has been reported by several studies ( \u2013 ). In the studies by Mi et al. ( ), Hu et al. ( ), and Chen et al. ( ), increased ALFF in this area was associated with motor functions such as posture instability and gait disturbances. It is well-known that the left inferior temporal lobe is critical for semantic integration and visual processing ( ,  ). Lahr et al. ( ) have demonstrated that PD patients relied on visual input to maintain upright postural control. Integration of visual sensory information is essential for appropriate movement initiation and execution. Inferior temporal lobe dysfunction may influence motor function and daily activities through impaired processing of visual information ( ,  ). How does aberrant brain activity of this zone affect motor function in LPD patients needs further investigation. \n\nWe found that ALFF of bilateral thalamus was lower in LPD patients than the controls, and ALFF value of thalamus was positively correlated with cognitive function. This positive correlation suggested that the lower the ALFF, the worse the cognitive function. Thus, this abnormality may be a pathological rather than a compensatory change. Thalamus is not only a vital relay of sensory pathways, but also a key component in corticobasal ganglia\u2013thalamic circuits, which modulates motor and cognitive function ( ). Decreased thalamic ALFF in PD has been reported in a number of studies ( ,  ,  ,  ) and might be associated with depression and gait disturbance ( ,  ). Our findings suggest that impaired thalamic activity may be associated with cognitive function in PD. This brain activity change may be mediated through disrupted corticobasal ganglia\u2013thalamic circuit ( ), as supported by an rs-fMRI study using functional connectivity ( ). Additionally, there is histopathological evidence of thalamic damage and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction in PD ( ,  ). Overall, our study confirmed thalamus dysfunction in LPD and suggested its association with cognitive impairment in PD. \n\nThe present study revealed lower ALFF in bilateral cerebellum anterior lobes. Cerebellar regulates motor and cognitive function through the cerebellothalamocortical circuit, which has several overlapping structures with the corticobasal ganglia\u2013thalamic loop ( ). Mi et al. ( ) also revealed decreased ALFF in the cerebellum anterior lobe in PD patients. Wu and Hallett ( ) assessed brain activity during automatic movements using fMRI and found increased cerebellar activity of bilateral cerebellum anterior lobes during automatic movements. They suggested that cerebellum might play a compensatory role in automatic movements. We did not find associations between the ALFF value of this area and motor or cognitive function. Maybe a more thorough evaluation especially including automatic movement performance would confirm its role in motor function. \n\nIt is noteworthy that there are some limitations of the study. First, the sample size is not very large. We obtained different results in comparisons between the two PD groups and the controls, but directly comparison between LPD and RPD patients did not show any significant difference. This may be due to the small difference between the two PD groups, and a larger sample size may have enough power to detect discrepancies between PD patients with left and right onset. Second, all the patients underwent dopaminergic medications; although we performed rs-fMRI examination in a practically defined off-state, the influence of antiparkinsonism medications cannot be completely ruled out. However, this practically defined off-state is quite commonly used in rs-fMRI studies in PD and would facilitate comparisons with other studies in this topic. \n\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that LPD had abnormalities in spontaneous brain activities in the left temporal lobe, bilateral thalamus, and cerebellum anterior lobes, and some of these changes were related to motor and cognitive function. However, RPD and healthy controls did not have significant difference in brain activities measured by ALFF. This finding indicates that LPD and RPD might have different neural mechanisms during neurodegeneration. Furthermore, this study highlights the necessity of dividing PD patients according to side of onset, to detect the characteristic pathophysiology of these two subgroups of PD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Hospital.

Presented on screen, it generates illusionary forward self-motion, pointing at a close vision-gait interrelation. As particularly parkinsonian gait is vulnerable to external stimuli, effects of optic flow on motor-related cerebral circuitry were explored with functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls (HC) and patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Fifteen HC and 22 PD patients, of which 7 experienced freezing of gait (FOG), watched wide-field flow, interruptions by narrowing or deceleration and equivalent control conditions with static dots. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that wide-field flow interruption evoked activation of the (pre-)supplementary motor area (SMA) in HC, which was decreased in PD. During wide-field flow, dorsal occipito-parietal activations were reduced in PD relative to HC, with stronger functional connectivity between right visual motion area V5, pre-SMA and cerebellum (in PD without FOG). Non-specific \u2018changes\u2019 in stimulus patterns activated dorsolateral fronto-parietal regions and the fusiform gyrus. This attention-associated network was stronger activated in HC than in PD. PD patients thus appeared compromised in recruiting medial frontal regions facilitating internally generated virtual locomotion when visual motion support falls away. Reduced dorsal visual and parietal activations during wide-field optic flow in PD were explained by impaired feedforward visual and visuomotor processing within a magnocellular (visual motion) functional chain. Compensation of impaired feedforward processing by distant fronto-cerebellar circuitry in PD is consistent with motor responses to visual motion stimuli being either too strong or too weak. The \u2018change\u2019-related activations pointed at covert (stimulus-driven) attention. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGoal-directed movement implies sensorimotor transformations that enable effective interactions with surrounding space and objects placed in it  \u2013 . Walking is a specific motor action characterized by multi-limb movements organized to achieve fluent locomotion, which heavily relies on visual representations of near and distant spatial environment. Aside from putative targets and obstacles that may guide motor control, forward locomotion itself generates a characteristic streaming motion of environmental features through the visual field. This \u2018optic flow\u2019 implies a radial expansion from the central point on the horizon ahead, provided that the observer does not fixate a specific object  . Optic flow is not only a visual consequence of locomotion, it also supports gait   and generates the illusion of forward self-motion when presented on a static display  . This visual motion stimulus thus appears to be intimately connected with the cerebral organization underlying locomotion. Support for the latter might be inferred from the involvement of premotor activations in recent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies  \u2013 . In the present study, we used fMRI to explore responses of visuomotor circuitry evoked by visual motion stimuli in elder healthy subjects and patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). \n\nIn PD, the effect of external stimuli on movements, either in a supporting or obstructing fashion, appears to be even stronger than in healthy subjects  \u2013 . This also holds for walking  ,  . In this respect, the effect of optic flow is underscored by the observation that improvement of gait by presentation of parallel traverse lines on the walking surface  \u2013  is dependent on the perceived motion flow of stripes due to walking itself  . This was assessed using stroboscopic light indicating that responsiveness of involved visuomotor circuitry favors dynamic more than static environmental features. The latter is consistent with the supporting effects of optic flow presented on screen during treadmill gait in PD  ,  ,   and visual motion manipulation during ground walking  ,  ,  . \n\nThe inability to maintain the cyclic pattern of walking is reflected in freezing of gait (FOG), which is a most disabling symptom that frequently occurs in PD patients  . A provocative environmental factor is e.g. the transition to narrow spaces like a corridor or doorway  \u2013 . On the other hand, visual stimuli may also provide support to overcome FOG  ,  ,  ,  ,  . Given the indications that optic flow provides a basic cue for gait support, we recently employed a treadmill paradigm with presentation of a wide-field radial flow pattern that gradually narrowed, mimicking the illusion of entering a narrow corridor  . During the transition to a narrow flow field, backward displacement due to slowing of gait was seen in PD patients particularly with left-sided symptom dominance. \n\nIn attempts to explain the failure to maintain performing a visuomotor action in circumstances of incongruence between visual stimuli and intended movement, disequilibrium between medial and lateral premotor functions should be considered. Visual information contributing to motor control is particularly processed along a dorsal (occipito-parietal) pathway involving lateral premotor regions, while internally driven action is particularly funnelled via the (pre-) supplementary motor area (pre-SMA and SMA), located on the medial hemisphere surface  ,  \u2013 . These medial premotor areas are dominant output targets from basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry  ,   and indeed functionally affected in PD  \u2013 . As a consequence, adverse external stimuli or loss of supporting stimuli cannot be met by internally driven action initiation mediated by SMA activity. In PD, reduction of optic flow stimuli at approaching a narrow doorway may thus result in FOG because a compensatory motor drive cannot be recruited due to impaired SMA function. In young healthy subjects, we indeed gained support for this concept by demonstrating that the transition from a wide to narrow optic flow field evokes (pre-)SMA activation  . \n\nIn line with these arguments, we aimed to test the hypothesis that observing the transition from a wide to narrow optic flow field also recruits medial frontal (pre-)SMA activation in elderly healthy subjects while it is reduced in PD patients. Moreover, as wide-field optic flow has a stronger influence on gait in PD than in healthy subjects, we wanted to assess whether this condition might evoke a stronger effect on the dorsal premotor cortex in the patients. As optic flow represents a basic visual motion stimulus, intrinsically linked to locomotion, manipulation of this specific stimulus pattern was considered to provide a tool to explore PD-related changes in the dorsal visuomotor pathway. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Ethical Statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen. All subjects gave written informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki. Procedures and task instructions were explained at least one week before scanning as well as immediately before the experiment. \n\n\n### Subject Inclusion \n  \nInitially, 24 PD patients were tested, of which 7 suffered from FOG (PD_FOG). For these 7 FOG patients (mean age 62.1 years, SD\u00b19.5; three males), FOG was documented by the FOG questionnaire translated in Dutch  . Two PD patients without FOG (PD_nFOG) were excluded from further analysis because they exhibited too many movements during scanning, thus resulting in the final inclusion of 15 PD_nFOG patients (60.9 years\u00b112.1; nine males). In addition, 15 age-matched elderly healthy controls (HC) (60.5 years\u00b16.2; nine males) were included ( ). The conclusions we finally draw in this study are based on the dataset of these two balanced groups of 15 subjects each, which was optimally constituted for rigorous image statistical analysis. None of the subjects had neurological, ophthalmologic or lower extremity disorders, other than PD in the patient group. Patients were tested after twelve-hour medication withdrawal to obtain optimal insight in PD-associated dysfunction. \n   Subject characteristics.        \n\n### Behavioral Assessments \n  \nMini Mental State Examination (MMSE)   and the Edinburgh handedness inventory   were conducted to underscore that participating subjects were non-demented and right-handed respectively. Education level was classified with a Dutch education scale, ranging from 1 (uncompleted elementary school) to 7 (university degree)  . In patients, the motor part of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)   was conducted immediately prior to the experiment. Furthermore, data concerning the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale  , levodopa-equivalent dose, disease duration and dominant side of PD symptoms were collected. Disease duration and dominant side of PD symptoms were derived from the clinical file. The side of symptom dominance, which was consistent with the UPDRS asymmetry, was similar to the side of symptom onset. \n\nThe block design subtest of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS) III  , representing visuomotor transformation, was applied as general indicator of right hemisphere function. Scores were obtained in the standard manner with the exception that subjects were not restricted by time limits, although the standard time limits were used as cut-off for the raw test scores. Rough scores were converted to scaled scores that provided the percentile values using norm tables for the subject\u2019s corresponding age. From these percentiles a commutation to T-values was made. As reduced movement speed in PD might be a confounding factor in the block design test, general \u2018block handling speed\u2019 was assessed, twice before and twice after performing the block design test. To that end, a series of four blocks was turned around as quickly as possible, in such a way that the side facing the table was turned upwards. The four blocks were subsequently arranged in a square without considering a specific pattern. \n\nWide-field visual presentation of a radially expanding flow of dots (optic flow) generates the illusion of forward self-motion  . Immediately following the fMRI scanning protocol that included the presentation of visual motion conditions, subjects were asked to rate this illusion for the conditions wide-field flow (FW), narrow-field flow (FN), wide-field static dots (SW) and narrow-field static dots (SN) on a scale from zero to maximal (0\u201310). All behavioral test were performed on the same day as the fMRI experiment. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses of Subject Characteristics and Performance \n  \nStatistical tests of group characteristics, PD parameters and behavioral assessment of the WAIS block design test were conducted with SPSS 19 (SPSS Inc: Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of data was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between groups for normal distributed data were tested with an independent t-test or one-way ANOVA for respectively two or more groups. If equal variance was violated according to Levene\u2019s test for equality of variances, we used the adjusted values of the t-test. Non-Gaussian data were tested with a Mann-Withney-U test or Kruskall Wallis for respectively two or more groups. For the latter, follow-up pairwise comparisons were conducted using a Wilcoxon test and correcting across these comparisons using the least significant difference procedure. \n\nWith regard to the ratings of illusionary perceived forward self-motion, differences between the HC, PD_nFOG and PD_FOG were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-Gaussian data (  p  <0.05, two-tailed). Within group differences were tested with the Friedman test for non-Gaussian data (  p  <0.05, two-tailed). Follow-up pairwise comparisons were conducted using a Wilcoxon test and correcting across these comparisons using the least significant difference procedure. \n\n\n### Task Design fMRI \n  \nDuring scanning, subjects watched stimulus patterns on a screen via a mirror placed approximately 11 cm from the face, with a mirror-screen distance of 64 cm. The screen dimensions were 44 by 34 cm, comprising 25.5\u00b0 by 32.7\u00b0 of the visual field. A projector with a monitor refresh rate of 30 Hz and a resolution of 1024\u00d7768 pixels (Barco, Belgium) projected the computer-generated stimuli on the screen. The experimental conditions were presented using the \u201cPresentation\u201d program (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc. Albany, CA, USA). \n\nAll conditions consisted of white dots on a black background in the lower half of the screen, with a mean density of approximately 340 dots. A small horizontal line was used for gaze fixation and placed at the middle of the virtual horizon in all conditions. Dot patterns were presented either in static or in dynamic mode. In the latter, stimuli consisted of 25 frames per second. Each dot radially moved with increasing speed from the center towards the bottom edge of the screen in two seconds. The mean speeds of a dot was 4.9\u00b0 in the first second and 7.9\u00b0 in the last second, reaching a maximum of 26\u00b0 per second at disappearance from the screen. Dots proportionally enlarged along their trajectory. This dynamic stimulus pattern of wide-field flow (FW) generated the illusionary perception of forward self-motion. \n\nOrdered in two conditions, FW was interrupted either by narrowing the flow field or by deceleration of dot movement. The gradual transition to a narrow flow field (FtN) was established by dark gray surfaces that expanded from the horizon in both upward and downward direction in 1.8 seconds, leaving a midline vertical narrow flow field (FN) of 1.3\u00b0, 4 percent. This transition evoked the natural illusion of entering a narrow corridor like a doorway. Stopping wide-field flow (FtS) was achieved by a linear reduction of dot velocity within 1.8 seconds, leaving a stationary wide field. In order to assess specificity of interrupting particularly wide-field flow, transition (StN) from a stationary wide field (SW) to a stationary narrow field (SN) with equal surfaces as in FtN served as control. After each of the transitions, the stimulus pattern lasted for 2.2 seconds. Until onset of the next stimulus condition, a rest condition with the central fixation line on an empty black background was shown, supporting continuous gaze fixation. \n\nStimuli were presented in a block design with six blocks ordered in two runs. In between the runs, a T1 anatomical scan was made. A block was constituted by six repetitions of each of the three stimulus trials [FW-FtN-FN], [FW-FtS-SW] and [SW-StN-SN], respectively. Trials were randomized for each block. In order to avoid stimulus anticipation, the duration of a stimulus pattern before transition varied between 5 and 10 seconds (in whole numbers). The intervening rest condition with only the central fixation bar lasted 2\u201310 seconds. This design resulted in 36 repeats for each condition, except for FW with twice as much repeats. \n\n\n### MRI Data Acquisition \n  \nData acquisition was performed using a 3T Philips MR system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a standard 8-channel head coil. A 3D T1-weighted anatomical scan was acquired with repetition time 9 ms, echo time 3.6 ms, flip angle 8\u00b0, field of view 232\u00d7256\u00d7170 mm, 170 slices without slice gap, voxel size 0.9\u00d71\u00d71 mm. Functional images were acquired with a gradient-echo T2* blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast technique using with a repetition time 2000 ms, echo time 28 ms, flip angle 70\u00b0, field of view 224\u00d7224\u00d7137 mm, 39 slices without slice gap, voxel size 3.5\u00d73.6\u00d73.5 mm. Two runs of 485 volumes each were obtained. MRI data acquisition took about 40 minutes. \n\n\n### Data Processing and Statistical Analysis of fMRI \n  \nPreprocessing and statistical analyses of images were conducted with Statistical Parametric Mapping   version 8 (2008, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK;  ). All obtained volumes were used for data analysis. Preprocessing with SPM included realignment, coregistration and spatial normalization (template of Montreal neurological institute, MNI). Thereafter, an isotropic 8 mm full-with at half-maximum Gaussian filter was applied to smooth the data spatially. \n\nAll conditions were modelled in a block design for the statistical analyses of regional difference in cerebral activations. Conditions were implicitly contrasted at subject level against the rest conditions with a short central horizontal line. Regressors describing head motion linear, quadratic and derivative for the three linear and three rotational movement parameters were included. \n\nConditions were analyzed at group level by a three-way ANOVA for repeated measurements in which group, subject and condition were modelled. Group consisted of three levels, HC, PD_nFOG and PD_FOG. Condition consisted of five levels, FW, FtN, FtS, SW and StN. Subjects and groups were assumed to be independent, equal variant with regard to subject and unequal variant with regard to group. Conditions were assumed to be dependent and unequal variant due to different stimulus durations. As side of symptom onset has been suggested to influence the effect of optic flow in PD patients  , this was included as covariate. Within and between groups comparisons were made. We compared wide-field flow (FW) with a static dot field (SW). The effects of interrupting wide-field flow (FtN and FtS) were both compared with narrowing a static dot field (StN). For FtN, this resulted in a well-balanced control condition. Although FtS and StN were not balanced for the dimensions of the visual field, StN controlled for effects due to change in the presented stimulus pattern. We additionally explored activation increases related to the three conditions characterized by a changing stimulus pattern (FtN, FtS and StN) when contrasted to the stable patterns (FW and SW). In this way, we aimed to gain insight in functional circuitry implicated in visual attention that might be relevant for understanding differences in visuomotor transformations between HC and PD. \n\nThe contrasts listed above were used for both within and between group comparisons. Thresholds for within group comparisons were initially set at   p  <0.001 (voxel-level uncorrected) and extent threshold (k) of 8 voxels. Comparing condition-related activations between groups was performed by explicit masking at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.05 with a subsequent threshold   p  <0.001 (uncorrected, extent threshold 8 voxels). For each contrast, clusters corrected for whole brain volume at   p  <0.05 (FWE) were considered statistically significant. Cerebral activations were rendered on either T1 brain slices or on the surface of a standard MNI brain in SPM. Brain regions were identified by checking the coordinates onto the automated anatomical labelling template in MRIcron  . \n\nTo explore differences between PD patients with either right or left dominant symptoms (PDR; PDL), we designed a second three-way ANOVA for repeated measurements in which again group, subject and condition were modelled. In this model, group consisted of the three levels HC, PDR and PDL. The presence or absence of FOG was included as covariate. Other settings equalled our first model. Within group comparisons and between group comparisons were set at the same thresholds. \n\n\n### Functional Connectivity of Right V5 \n  \nAs the motion sensitive area V5 had the expected critical role in the current study  ,  , and the right hemisphere has been described to play a dominant role in both normal visuomotor function  ,   and affected gait in PD  ,  , we employed a functional connectivity analysis of right V5. Functional connectivity was assessed by using the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) method  , which expresses the influence of neural activity of one over other cerebral regions. A nine mm sphere was selected around right V5 (x 48, y \u221270, z 0). \n\nAn individual PPI analysis was performed for each subject. PPI was computed as the cross-product of the extracted eigenvariate time series of right V5 and the convolved \u2018psychological\u2019 task effect (FW compared to SW). This PPI was entered as regressor in the first level PPI analysis along with two other regressors. The original eigenvariate of right V5 was included next to the convolved psychological variable, which results in a PPI analysis excluding the main effect of task but looks at the synchrony of neural activity between right V5 and other cerebral regions depending on the psychological variable (FW versus SW). \n\nBrain regions with a positive regression slope with right V5 dependent upon the \u2018psychological\u2019 variable were identified for each subject. These contrasts were entered in a second-level ANOVA with three groups (HC, PD_nFOG and PD_FOG), which were assumed to be independent but unequal variant. The functional connectivity of right V5 depending on the wide-field flow versus the stationary wide field within a group were tested at   p  <0.05 voxel level corrected for whole brain volume (FWE). Between group differences were shown by exclusive masking using an initial threshold of   p  <0.05 (uncorrected) with a subsequent conservative threshold of   p  <0.05 voxel level corrected for whole brain volume (FWE). A cluster extend threshold of eight voxels was used for within and between group analysis. \n\n\n### Correlation between Medial Premotor Activation and WAIS Block Design Test \n  \nThe behaviorally assessed WAIS block design task for visuomotor abilities was expected to correlate with the ability to activate medial premotor areas during narrowing specifically the optic flow field (FtN>StN). To that end, we used the human motor area template   to create an independent region of interest constituted by the supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA, bilaterally. Extracting mean betas for this region was done using the MarsBar toolbox in SPM ( ). Mean beta\u2019s during StN were subtracted from those obtained in FtN. \n\nAs we specifically expected that poorer visuomotor abilities measured by the WAIS block-design task resulted in reduced medial premotor activation, correlations with one sided   p  -values were used. A Pearson\u2019s correlation was used for an uncontrolled correlation of the WAIS block design T-values (age corrected) with the medial premotor activations, while a partial correlation was used for calculating the correlation further controlled for block handling speed, MMSE, education level, UPDRS and PD onset-side. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group Characteristics \n  \nBasic characteristics of HC, PD_nFOG and PD_FOG did not significantly differ with regard to age (  F  (2,36)\u200a=\u200a0.073,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.930), education level (  H  (2)\u200a=\u200a1.670,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.434) and MMSE (  H  (2)\u200a=\u200a2.828,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.367 ( ). Neither were such differences found for block handling speed (  F  (2,36)\u200a=\u200a2.492,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.098) or performance on the WAIS block design task (  F  (2,36)\u200a=\u200a1.954,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.098). Significant differences were not seen either when the group of HC was compared with a single composite group of all PD patients. \n\nCompared to PD_nFOG, PD_FOG patients had higher scores on the motor part of the UPDRS (  t  (20)\u200a=\u200a\u22123.696,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001) and rated higher on the FOG scale (  t  (20)\u200a=\u200a\u22126.202,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001). The latter included two questions concerning the impact of deteriorated gait, unrelated to the presence of possible FOG. No significant differences were seen between the two PD groups for the modified Hoehn and Yahr stage (  U  \u200a=\u200a41.00,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.367), PD duration (  t  (20)\u200a=\u200a\u22121.864,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.77) and levodopa equivalent dose (  t  (20)\u200a=\u200a\u22121.619,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.121) ( ). Overall, our PD patients were mild to moderately affected although advanced PD was not an exclusion criterion. On the other hand, patients with cognitive impairment (assessed with the MMSE) and patients who were considered unable to sustain the demand of the fMRI experiment were excluded. As such conditions are often associated with advanced PD, this may have led to an indirect exclusion of severely affected patients. \n\n\n### Perceived Illusion of Forward Self-motion \n  \nWide-field flow evoked a clear perception of forward self-motion in all three groups. This was underscored by the significant within group differences for the wide- and narrow-field presentations in flow and static mode (FW, FN, SW and SN;   p  <0.001). In FW, this illusion was stronger than in SW and SN for all groups. When compared to FN, the illusion in FW was rated significantly stronger (  p  <0.05) by HC and PD_nFOG, while PD_FOG did not perceive significant differences in forward self-motion between FW and FN (  p  \u200a=\u200a0.231). This might be due to some residual flow in FN and the small number of PD_FOG patients. Comparing ratings between groups showed that the perception of forward self-motion was equally strong during FW for all groups; HC median 3 (interquartile range 1\u20137), PD_nFOG 4.5 (0\u20137), PD_FOG 5.5 (2\u20138);   H  (2)\u200a=\u200a0.675,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.713. In FN, this sensation was virtually absent for all groups: HC 0 (0\u20131.5), PD_nFOG 0 (0\u20130), PD_FOG 0 (0\u20135);   H  (2)\u200a=\u200a2.263,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.270. It was fully absent in SW and SN for all three groups (each 0; 0\u20130). \n\n\n### Cerebral Activations Related to Wide-field Flow \n  \nCerebral activations related to FW (contrasted to SW), which evoked the illusionary perception of forward self-motion, were bilaterally distributed over striate and extrastriate visual cortical regions, including the putative visual motion area V5 ( ,  ). Particularly in HC, this pattern of activation extended dorsally into the posterior superior parietal cortex, with a significant cluster in the right-hemisphere ( ). Left-sided V1/V2 activation was significantly increased in HC relative to PD_nFOG, as revealed by exclusive masking of the HC pattern by the PD_nFOG activations (  p  <0.05, cluster-level corrected for brain volume;  ). Relative to PD_FOG, HC activation was increased in V1/V2 and V5, bilaterally, and in the right posterior parietal cortex. These activation differences (particularly in V5) similarly emerged from the pattern of activation increases in PD_nFOG when exclusively masked by the PD_FOG pattern. The FW-related right posterior parietal activation in HC, which was not seen in the two patient groups, was indeed significantly increased relative to only PD_FOG (exclusive masking;   p  <0.05 cluster-level corrected). Relative to PD_nFOG, such increase in HC only reached a subthreshold level of   p  <0.001 (voxel-level uncorrected). \n   Wide-field optic flow.  \nCerebral activations related to wide-field radial optic flow (FW) contrasted to a wide stationary dot field (SW) in healthy controls (HC) are projected on transversal sections (A) and rendered onto brain surfaces (B). Activations in Parkinson patients without freezing of gait (PD_nFOG) and with freezing of gait (PD_FOG) are displayed in C and D, respectively. Thresholds are set at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001 voxel-level uncorrected with an extended voxel threshold of eight voxels. T-values are displayed in the color bars. R\u200a=\u200aright side of the brain, V5\u200a=\u200avisual motion complex V5. \n     Cerebral activation in wide field flow contrasted to a wide stationary field.        \n\n### Cerebral Activations Related to Wide-field Flow Interruption \n  \nThe crucial condition of gradually narrowing the wide-field flow (FtN) was expected to evoke stronger medial frontal activation in HC than in PD. Contrasting FtN to StN indeed resulted in a single cluster of significant activation in the SMA of HC, which extended in the pre-SMA (max. x \u221216, y \u22126, z 60; T-value\u200a=\u200a4.95,   p  <0.05, cluster-level corrected) ( ). Such activation did not occur in either PD group. Exclusive masking of HC activation by PD_nFOG subtreshold results further demonstrated this increased (pre-)SMA activation in HC (  p  <0.05, cluster-corrected), which was similarly seen by exclusive masking of HC with PD_FOG. Applying such masking, no significant activation differences were seen between PD_FOG and PD_nFOG in FtN contrasted to StN. A trend of more (pre-)SMA impairment in PD_FOG than in PD_nFOG might be suggested by the lower contrast estimate for PD_FOG (\u22120.37) than for PD_nFOG (\u22120.10) during FtN, while during StN these values were \u22120.12 and \u22120.09, respectively. \n   Narrowing wide-field optic flow.  \nCerebral activation related to the transition from wide to narrow optic flow (FtN) contrasted to narrowing of a stationary dot field (StN) in healthy controls (HC) is displayed in a glass brain view (A). Responses of the single significant cluster (max x \u221216, y \u22126, z 60) are shown for HC and the entire Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) group (B). Threshold is set at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001 uncorrected with an extended voxel threshold (k) of eight voxels. CI\u200a=\u200aconfidence interval; FW\u200a=\u200awide optic flow; FtS\u200a=\u200agradual transition to stop wide optic flow; SW\u200a=\u200awide stationary dot field. R\u200a=\u200aright side of the brain. \n  \nThe second condition of interrupting FW, i.e. by gradual deceleration of the radial dot flow (FtS), yielded a similar mediofrontal effect as FtN. Contrasting FtS to StN showed a cluster of increased activation (exclusive masking) in the (pre-)SMA of HC (max. x \u22122, y \u22122, z 66; T\u200a=\u200a5.23), relative to PD_FOG as well as to PD_nFOG (each   p  <0.05, cluster corrected). Similarly, exclusive masking revealed increased (pre-)SMA activation in PD_nFOG relative to PD_FOG (  p  <0.05, cluster corrected). For the assessment of FtS, the same control condition StN was used as in the comparison with FtN. Although FtS and StN were not balanced for the spatial dimensions of the visual field, a control condition for non-specific change in the visual field appeared to be important (see results related to changing visual patterns). In addition to the FtS-related medial frontal activation, contrasting FtS to StN also resulted in bilateral activation in V1/V2 (only significant for the left hemisphere at   p  <0.05 whole-brain cluster corrected; max x 14, y \u2212102, z 2), without significant differences between groups. \n\nThe reduced (pre-)SMA activation in PD at interrupting FW was hypothesized to mimic the impaired ability to internally recruit motor circuitry when external support falls away. We therefore assessed whether the magnitude of mediofrontal activation would be associated with a behavioral parameter concerning visuomotor control in PD. To that end, a bilateral SMA and pre-SMA template was applied to demarcate a volume of interest. Increased activation in this volume correlated with higher (age-corrected) scores on the WAIS block-design task in PD_nFOG patients (  r  \u200a=\u200a0.54,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.010). Although a similar trend was seen for PD_FOG patients as well as HC, correlations did not reach statistical significance (PD_FOG   r  \u200a=\u200a0.29,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.264; HC   r  \u200a=\u200a0.36,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.094). The correlation in PD_nFOG became even stronger when further controlled for block handling speed, MMSE, education level, UPDRS and onset-side (  r  \u200a=\u200a0.80,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.003). \n\nAs the involvement of a \u2018mesencephalic locomotor region\u2019 has recently been described to be either hyperactive   or impaired in FOG  , we looked for subthreshold effects at the described location (  p  <0.05, voxel-level uncorrected). FtN contrasted to StN showed a small cluster (9 voxels) in HC (x 6, y 28, z \u221220; T-value\u200a=\u200a2.07), which was not seen in either PD_FOG or PD_nFOG. Although our observation does not concern a significant activation, it would best fit with the results of Shine and colleagues  . \n\n\n### Effect of Side of PD Symptoms on Wide-field Flow Activation \n  \nGiven a general dominance of the right hemisphere in visuospatial processing, we explored possible activation differences between hemispheres related to the side of symptom dominance in PD patients. To that end, PD patients with right and left dominant symptoms (PDR,   N  \u200a=\u200a13 of which 5 FOG; PDL,   N  \u200a=\u200a9 of which 2 FOG) were compared with a separate ANOVA controlling for FOG binary. The only difference in brain activation was seen in FW contrasted to SW ( , see further). No significant differences were seen between PDR and PDL during the interruption of FW, neither in FtN nor in FtS. At subthreshold level (  p  <0.05, cluster-level, uncorrected) activation differences were not seen either. \n   Wide-field optic flow and lateralization of symptoms.  \nCerebral activations related to wide-field flow (FW) contrasted to a wide stationary field (SW) are rendered onto a brain surface (posterior view) for thirteen right symptom dominant Parkinson patients (PDR) and nine left symptom dominant Parkinson patients (PDL). Thresholds are set at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001 uncorrected with an extended voxel threshold of eight voxels. T-values are displayed in the color bars. R\u200a=\u200aright side of the brain. \n  \nRelative to PDR, the PDL patients showed decreased activation during FW contrasted to SW (  p  <0.05, cluster corrected; PDR increases exclusively masked by PDL) in the dorsal extension of right V5 (x 40, y \u221266, z 8) and a right lateral occipital area at a more ventral location (x 46, y \u221270, z \u221216) ( ). A right posterior parietal activation decrease (x 8, y \u221278, z 54; T-value\u200a=\u200a3.96) remained at subthreshold significance level, which was similarly the case for left V5 activation. No activation decreases were seen in PDR relative to PDL (using exclusive masking). PDR patients showed a similar distribution of activations as HC, while PDL patients showed similar changes relative to HC as to PDR. \n\n\n### Cerebral Activation Related to Changing Stable Visual Patterns \n  \nTwo observations from the preceding results were a reason for additional analysis. First, in contrast to our expectation  , we did not find (right) dorsal premotor (PMd) activation related to FW. Second, V5 activation was not restricted to FW, but appeared to be strong in both FtN and StN as well. As V5 activation was similarly strong in these two conditions, the specificity of particularly interrupting FW by FtN was adequately balanced by the introduction of StN, controlling for V5 activation due to the apparent motion effect of gradually narrowing the dot field. It did, however, point at a hidden variable. Plotting the effect size at the PMd site of hardly detectable change in FW contrasted to SW (x 26, y 0, z 56) revealed a characteristic increase of activations related to exclusively FtN, FtS and StN in HC only ( ). As this profile of responses distinguished the conditions with change in the visual stimulus pattern, we subsequently contrasted these three conditions of change to the stable patterns FW and SW. This resulted in a robust pattern of significant activation increases in HC comprising fusiform gyri, putative V5, the anterior portion of the inferior wall of the calcarine sulcus (peripheral field representation of V1), dorsolateral extrastriate visual cortex, medio-posterior (superior) and antero-lateral (inferior) parietal cortex, bilaterally, right PMd and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of both hemispheres ( ,  ). \n   Right dorsal premotor responses in wide-field optic flow.  \nContrasting wide-field optic flow (FW) to a wide stationary field (SW) revealed a hardly detectable FW-related effect in the right dorsal premotor cortex of healthy controls (HC) by a threshold of   p  \u200a=\u200a0.5 (extended voxel threshold eight voxels). However, the response pattern at this location (max. x 26, y 0, z 56) was particularly characterized by increased activation related to the \u2018change\u2019 conditions in HC, compared to the stable conditions FW and SW. Moreover, these increases were not seen in the Parkinson patients (PD). Abbreviations are as in  . \n     Non-specific \u2018change\u2019 in the stimulus pattern.  \nCerebral activations related to the conditions with non-specific \u2018change\u2019 in the presented visual stimuli (FtN, FtS, StN) contrasted to the stable stimulus patterns (FW, SW) in healthy subjects (HC) are projected on transversal sections and a coronal one (A) and rendered onto brain surfaces (right lateral view; B). Activations in Parkinson patients without freezing of gait (PD_nFOG) and with freezing of gait (PD_FOG) are displayed in C and D, respectively. Thresholds are set at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.001 uncorrected with an extended voxel threshold of eight voxels. T-values are displayed in the color bars. Fus.\u200a=\u200afusiform gyrus, PMd\u200a=\u200adorsal premotor cortex. Other abbreviations are as in  . \n     Cerebral activation in changing versus stable visual stimulus patterns.        \nIn PD_nFOG, these activations related to visual change were less robust, while PMd activation was absent ( ,  ). PD_FOG showed even less activation, without medial fusiform and parietal activations ( ). The importance of left fusiform function in our paradigm was further underscored by the fact that this focus of activation (x \u221228, y \u221266, z \u221210) was the main denominator that discriminated the HC and PD groups (F-test HC contrasted to PD;   F  \u200a=\u200a10.02,   p  \u200a=\u200a0.002, FWE-corrected at voxel level) ( ). We did not find a correlation of this fusiform gyrus activation with either UPDRS or Hoehn and Yahr scores in the PD patients. Neither was a correlation seen with the WAIS block design task or illusion of FW-related forward self-motion in either HC or the PD groups. \n   Main difference between healthy controls and Parkinson patients.  \nThe F contrast of the differences between healthy controls (HC) and the entire Parkinson group (PD) highlights the left fusiform gyrus, shown in a glass brain view (A) and by sections in both transversal and coronal sections (B). Responses of the left fusiform gyrus in the experimental conditions are shown for HC and PD patients (C). Conventions and abbreviations are as in  . \n  \n\n### Distant Effects of Right V5 \n  \nAs FW contrasted to SW revealed a general reduction of visual cortex activation in PD and no associated premotor activation, we tested whether particularly the right visual motion area V5 (x 48, y \u221270, z 0) might nevertheless have a stronger influence on premotor regions in PD than in HC. Functional connectivity using PPI revealed significant effects in V1/V2 of HC ( ) while in PD_nFOG additional effects were particularly seen in the medial prefrontal cortex, pre-SMA (x \u22124, y 26, z 50, dorsally extending onto plane z 58), and the anterior lobes of the cerebellum (  p  <0.05, FWE cluster corrected) ( ). No significant distant effects were seen from right V5 in PD_FOG. Exclusive masking of the effects in PD_nFOG by the HC effects showed that the V5 effects on the medial prefrontal cortex (left dominant) and right cerebellum were stronger in this patient group than in HC ( ). \n   Functional connectivity of right V5.  \nCerebral regions that were identified by their functional connectivity with the right visual motion area V5 (using psychophysiological interaction, PPI) during wide-field radial optic flow (FW) contrasted to a wide stationary field (SW). These regions are displayed in glass brains\u00a0(A) and projected on sections (B) for healthy controls (HC), Parkinson patients without freezing of gait (PD_nFOG) and for the latter when exclusively masked with HC\u00a0at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.05. Thresholds are set at   p  \u200a=\u200a0.05 FWE corrected for whole brain volume with an extended voxel threshold of eight voxels. In addition, subthreshold effects in a transversal section at z\u200a=\u200a60 are shown for PD_nFOG, threshold T\u200a=\u200a4.5 (extended cluster threshold of eight voxels). T-values are displayed in the color bars. The corresponding graphs (C) show the contrast estimates and 90 percent confidence intervals (CI) for the maxima in the left fusiform gyrus, the pre-SMA and right cerebellum respectively. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWide-field radial optic flow, which generated the illusionary perception of forward self-motion in both HC and PD patients, was related with reduced visual cortex activation in PD patients. On the other hand, functional connectivity of right visual motion area V5 with medial prefrontal cortex (pre-SMA) and cerebellum was stronger in PD_nFOG than in HC. The latter might point at functional circuitry implicated in enhanced stimulus effects on movement (including locomotion) known to occur in PD. The conditions with gradual transition from wide-field flow to either narrow flow or a wide static field, which was considered to mimic a circumstance requiring a stronger internal effort to maintain (virtual) locomotion when visual support falls away, evoked (pre-)SMA activation only in HC and not in the two PD patient groups. The number of included patients in the PD_FOG group (  N  \u200a=\u200a7) was small, which is a reason to refrain from drawing firm conclusions concerning this PD subgroup. Keeping this restriction in mind, the obtained patterns of activation generally suggest that PD_FOG represented advanced PD relative to PD_nFOG (  N  \u200a=\u200a15), which also emerged from the UPDRS differences. Finally, we identified a distribution of activations related to non-specific \u2018change\u2019 in the presented patterns of stimuli. In HC, these activations included the dorsal occipital-parietal cortex lateral to the regions of wide-flow induced activation, together with fusiform gyrus and right premotor regions. These activations were less robust in PD, suggesting PD-related changes in visuospatial attention. \n\n### Reduced Visual Cortex Activation and Enhanced Distant Interactions in PD in Wide-field Flow \n  \nWide-field optic flow generated the illusionary perception of forward self-motion in all three groups. In HC, the flow-related activations comprised the visual motion area V5, ventrally extending on the right side, posterior V1/V2 and dorsal extrastriate visual cortex extending more strongly in the right parietal cortex. This dorsal pathway activation, representing circuitry implicated in dynamic visuospatial processing  ,  , was less robust in PD. Given the behavioral observations of stronger stimulus effects on motor control in PD than in HC, the reduction of PD visual cortex activation and the absence of dorsal premotor involvement in FW (contrasted to SW) might, at first sight, suggest the opposite effect, i.e. a reduced information flow onto motor-related circuitry. On the other hand, reduced visual activation may reflect a less elaborate level of information processing within the visual cortex. Such visual information is processed in a highly segregated fashion, with parvo (color) and magnocellular (motion) streams that can be distinguished at the retinal level and in the striate and extrastriate visual cortex  . In PD, these basic visual processing streams may be affected independently  . However, visual cortex processing is not only characterized by such segregation as integration plays an important role too  . Feedback is one of such integration processes, which is reflected e.g. in the variance whether visual motion input in V1 precedes or follows input in V5  \u2013 . Reduced visual activations and enhanced functional connectivity of right V5 with medial frontal-cerebellar circuitry in PD might thus reflect impaired visual cortex integration, with the consequence of dominating distant interactions along the segregated processing stream of visual motion funnelled through V5. \n\nEnhanced functional connectivity between visual processing sites and distant action-related regions, with a reduced contribution of intermediate occipito-parietal regions, might result in less fine-tuned responses to visual stimuli, i.e. inducing responses that are either too strong or too weak. Such unbalanced responses due to \u2018by-passing\u2019 optimal parietal processing in sensori-motor planning would be consistent with the role of the parietal cortex providing \u2018sensory\u2019 information for feedforward processing in motor planning  \u2013 . This means that in normal conditions, the predicted sensory consequences of planned movements are used to optimize preparation of such movements. Such parietal feedforward function is supported by interactions with the cerebellum  \u2013 . The association of medial prefrontal (pre-SMA) and cerebellar functions, inferred from the increased functional connectivity of right V5, might point at an alternative, compensatory strategy for impaired sensation-based feedforward processing in PD. The role of the (pre-)SMA in such compensation would fit its involvement in error detection and serial ordering  \u2013 . In this, compensation would be based on a mechanism of error correction facilitated by a \u2018wider reference frame\u2019 for assessing predictions. Wider referencing implies that sensory predictions are not restricted to immediate movement fragments but are made in the context of a larger time scale with movement patterns constituting series of events  \u2013 . \n\n\n### Interrupting Wide-field Optic Flow and Activation of the (pre-)SMA \n  \nNarrowing the wide flow field evoked a single significant cluster of (pre-)SMA activation in HC and not in the two PD groups (FtN contrasted to StN). This confirmed the main hypothesis of our study. A lower contrast estimate in PD_FOG than in PD_nFOG might hint at more (pre-)SMA impairment in PD_FOG. Interrupting wide-field flow by gradual deceleration (FtS contrasted to StN) did also reveal medial frontal activation comprising SMA and pre-SMA in HC, while at this focus of maximum activation, a strong reduction was seen in PD_FOG relative to PD_nFOG. It should be recognized that the activation increase resulting from FtN contrasted to StN was most specifically associated with the interruption of perceived forward self-motion because possible effects of e.g. attention to change, due to narrowing itself, was balanced by narrowing a static dot field (StN). The other condition of interruption (deceleration, FtS) was controlled for non-specific change by similarly using StN, although FtS and StN were not optimally balanced for visual field dimensions. In both FtN and FtS, recruitment of the (pre-)SMA is considered to reflect its contribution to an internal drive to continue virtual locomotion when external support from visual flow falls away. This is consistent with the crucial involvement of the SMA and pre-SMA in the internal generation of movements, relative to externally driven action  ,  . The fact that our PD patients were compromised in such SMA recruitment fits the previously described functional impairment of this important outflow target of the basal ganglia  ,  ,  \u2013 . \n\nAs phrased before, the small number of patients with FOG does not allow final conclusions concerning changes in circuitry related to this symptom. However, reduced activations and higher UPDRS motor scores suggest that PD_FOG concerns a more advanced stage of disease, although the Hoehn and Yahr range between 2 and 2.5 indicates that differences were subtle. Reduced (pre-)SMA activation in PD at the loss of (virtual) gait-support thus appears to be a more general than a specific indicator related to FOG, pointing at an important role in visuospatial coordination which fails at specific epochs of changing visual motion in PD. Previous fMRI activation studies addressing FOG in PD made use of visuomotor tasks that included either imagery walking in virtual reality   or actual bipedal movements providing visual feedback by virtual progression in a displayed corridor  . Snijders and co-workers found hyperactivity in the \u2018mesencephalic motor region\u2019 during gait imagery in PD_FOG (relative to PD_nFOG), while reduced activations were seen in medial frontal regions. In the study of Shine and co-workers, reduction of bipedal movements (virtual FOG) was induced by visual instructions that inflicted an increased cognitive load in PD patients. These changes resulted in lateral fronto-parietal activation increases and decreased activation of the sensorimotor cortex and caudate nucleus. Controlled for the visually presented cognitive load, region of interest analysis showed reduced activation in the \u2018mesencephalic motor region\u2019, which correlated with the FOG severity. \n\nFoci of reduced medial frontal activations associated with PD in general as well as PD_FOG was a common finding in our study and that of Snijders and co-workers, including the variance in the condition-specific foci of maximum activation within SMA, pre-SMA and cingulate motor cortex. With regard to effects specifically associated with FOG, e.g. on the \u2018mesencephalic motor region\u2019, final conclusions cannot be drawn from our study due to the low number of PD_FOG patients. Moreover, one may assume that in the Snijders study, compared to a strict visual stimulus paradigm, motor imagery did recruit more extended motor-related circuitry, indeed enabling identification of such FOG-related change in mesencephalic activation which we did not. In this respect, these studies are complementary because our study highlighted the PD-associated functional changes in medial frontal and visual cortex regions when challenged by a specific visual motion stimulus. In addition, we demonstrated a distribution of activations associated with non-specific \u2018change\u2019 in the presented visual pattern that resembled previously described spatial attention networks  \u2013 . The lateral fronto-parietal regions of activation decrease in our PD patients (relative to HC) were similar to the fronto-parietal activations associated with inhibited bipedal movements due to cognitive load in the PD patients of Shine et al.  . While in their study, an increased cognitive demand was intrinsically associated with both a decrease of bipedal movements and the consequent slowing of virtual progression in the displayed corridor, our analysis enabled a dissociation between global attention to spatial change and the specific effect of interrupting wide-field flow, i.e. interrupting the illusionary perception of forward self motion. \n\n\n### Attention to Non-specific Spatial Change \n  \nThe absence of right PMd activation was a reason to explore subthreshold responses in this cortical region, which revealed that responses at this location were specifically evoked by change of the stimulus pattern, i.e. FtN, FtS as well as StN. Moreover these responses were significantly stronger in HC than in PD. Contrasting the conditions characterized by \u2018change\u2019 to the \u2018stable\u2019 stimulus patterns FW and SW resulted in a distribution of robust activations bilaterally comprising the fusiform gyrus, dorsolateral visual, parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, together with right-dominant PMd activation. Particularly the dorsal parietal-PMd-prefrontal pattern of activations pointed at a functional network implicated in spatial attention processing  \u2013 . Although subjects were not instructed to explicitly detect changes in the presented stimulus patterns, differences between the conditions made it plausible to infer that the \u2018change\u2019-related distribution of activations indeed represented a neuronal mechanism of processing covert spatial attention. In PD patients such mechanism seems to be impaired. \n\nWhile goal-directed attention to distinct features in a visual scene involves top-down processing, covert attention points at bottom-up mechanisms of detecting unpredictable change  \u2013 . The fusiform gyrus can be recruited in both ways. The circumstance of covert attention (to change) in our experiment provides the main argument to assume that its activation is particularly due to bottom-up processing, while fusiform gyrus participation in an otherwise dorsal visual pathway points at a visuospatial function associated with novelty detection or saliency processing  ,  . Classically, the fusiform gyrus plays a prominent role in the ventral visual stream concerning e.g. shape and object recognition, which is distinguished from dorsal pathway processing of visuospatial characteristics  ,  . On the other hand, early ventral occipito-temporal contributions to spatial processing are particularly revealed in experimental settings with objects placed outside a target point of central fixation  ,  \u2013 . Functional coherence of the fusiform gyrus and parietal cortex, as we found in the \u2018change\u2019 conditions of our experiment, may therefore be associated with the assessment of \u2018objects\u2019 (or basic shapes) in a dynamic environment. Such assessment becomes relevant during e.g. locomotion, when unexpected (extra-fovealy projected) obstacles need to be avoided  ,  ,  . Changes in the visual patterns we employed indeed occurred in primarily the peripheral visual field. This held for narrowing the dot field, both in flow and static mode, as well as for deceleration, which implied that the largest change of radial dot speed occurred in the peripheral part of the display. An additional argument that \u2018change\u2019-related activations predominantly occurred in the peripheral visual field can be concluded from the anterior calcarine activation, which topologically represents the peripheral field  ,  . \n\nIn addition to our proposal that impaired visual motion processing in PD leads to impaired motor preparation due to reduced feedforward processing, one may also consider that impaired novelty detection in a changing visually recorded environment may lead to delate motor adjustments. This seems consistent with the previously suggested disruption of (right-hemisphere) visual and \u2018executive-attention\u2019 networks in PD_FOG  . A consequence would be that in visual circumstances requiring stronger internally driven motor control, this may not only fail in PD due to impaired medial prefrontal function, but the initial cue for such recruitment may not be strong enough either. On the other hand, the specificity of our (pre-)SMA activation in HC at interrupting the illusion of forward self motion was due to contrasting two balanced \u2018change\u2019 conditions (FtN versus StN), thus pointing at a response strongly associated with higher-order network consequences of visual motion processing such as e.g. motor intention. The general \u2018change\u2019 activations included lateral but no medial prefrontal regions, neither in HC nor in PD. This underscores the distinction between neuronal circuitries related either to general visual attention or to specific visual motion processing in our paradigm. One might oppose that lateral fronto-parietal activations related to the \u2018change\u2019 conditions may similarly reflect top-down visual processing  ,  . We agree that the latter may play a role too and that in PD, impaired attention may contribute in various ways to dysfunction of motor behavior, including gait  ,  . The fact, however, that our design did not include an explicit attention condition, favors a dominance of bottom-up attention-related processing. \n\n\n### Right Hemisphere Impairment in PD Visuomotor Control \n  \nThe absence of a correlation between FOG and the WAIS block design task did not provide support for a relation between FOG and right-hemisphere dysfunction in PD, although such correlation has previously been reported  . The low number of PD_FOG patients may be due to this negative result. On the other hand, the correlation between (pre-)SMA activation during FtN and the WAIS block design task indicates that impaired right hemisphere function is associated with the reduced ability to recruit an internal drive to maintain virtual locomotion when the perceived forward self-motion is interrupted. This might support the discussed option that impaired bottom-up visual motion processing fails to provide the optimal cues for (pre-)SMA activation. More support for involvement of the right hemisphere came from differences between patients with right and left dominant symptoms during wide-field optic flow. In this condition, PDR patients (dominated by left hemisphere disease) showed more activation of the dorsal stream (including the right posterior parietal cortex) compared to PDL patient (dominated by right hemisphere disease). These results point at consistency with previously described right-hemisphere dominance concerning visuomotor transformations  ,  , including gait   and optic flow-derived visuospatial perception in PD  . Furthermore, they fit well with a previously suggested relation between left symptomatic PD and freezing of gait occurrence  . \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur findings indicated that the compromised ability of PD patients to internally generate action for maintaining virtual locomotion when external support of wide-field flow falls away is based on impaired (pre-)SMA activation. Reduced dorsal occipito-parietal activation during wide-field flow in PD was argued to reflect reduced visuo-spatial integration, with the effect that predicted sensory consequences of movements cannot be optimally implemented in motor preparation. This impaired occipito-parietal function was associated with enhanced functional connectivity of a segregated magnocellular functional stream through right visual motion area V5 with distant medial fronto-cerebellar circuitry. In this way, compensation of impaired early-stage feedforward processing is logically based on a shift to more distant fronto-cerebellar feedforward processing. The latter implies, however, that motor responses to visual motion stimuli may be either too strong or too weak in PD. In addition, we identified a seperate pattern of activations related to non-specific stimulus change which pointed at covert spatial attention and impairment of such function in PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3995937, "text_md5": "5e60fa4a0512f9dc56023c54d7907c4d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 86], "journal": [87, 95], "publication_year": [97, 101], "title": [112, 216], "keywords": [230, 230], "abstract": [243, 2110], "body": [2119, 57464]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24755754, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0095861", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995937", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3995937"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995937\">3995937</a>", "list_title": "PMC3995937  Parkinson-Related Changes of Activation in Visuomotor Brain Regions during Perceived Forward Self-Motion"}

Regional brain atrophy and genetic expression was co-registered to a common 86 region brain atlas and robust multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify genetic predictors of regional brain atrophy. Top candidate genes from GWAS analysis, as well as genes implicated in trans-synaptic alpha-synuclein transfer and autosomal recessive PD were included in our analysis. We identify three genes with expression patterns that are highly significant predictors of regional brain atrophy.

Neural circuit dysfunction in PD is pronounced throughout the brain, leading to motor deficits, as well as symptoms that include depression and visuospatial disturbances ( ). The advent of functional neurosurgery in PD has led to improved outcomes for some patients with PD ( ). However, pharmacological therapeutic strategies remain limited to dopamine replacement; an approach introduced more than 50\u202fyears ago ( ). New treatment paradigms are needed, but our understanding of how to develop them is still limited. \n\nOne promising approach is to target genes that have been implicated in PD either by large genome wide association studies (GWAS) in humans or by experimental studies in animal models. Variation in multiple genes, including alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and tau (MAPT), increases PD risk in GWAS studies ( ). Many additional lines of evidence have established a role for synuclein in PD pathogenesis and progression. In addition to its role as a risk factor in sporadic PD, genetic variants of synuclein cause rare forms of familial PD ( ). A leading hypothesis postulates that transfer of synuclein between cells explains both the anatomical and temporal progression of PD-related circuit dysfunction and atrophy ( ;  ,  ). \n\nA recent study by   identified four proteins that may mediate trans-synaptic transfer of synuclein in a mouse model of PD. Deletion of one of them, lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG3) which directly binds synuclein preformed fibrils, prevents substantia nigra neuron death and corresponding behavioral deficits. Given these findings, we sought to determine whether the regional expression of the genes involved in synuclein transfer in Mao et al., as well as ten top candidate genes (of 24 genes with significant genome-wide association) identified from the PD GWAS meta-analysis by  , and the three genes strongly associated with the typical form of autosomal recessive PD ( ), can predict the regional pattern of atrophy in PD. These genes do not comprise a complete list of genes implicated in PD, but do represent a set of genes with high a priori probability of being associated with regional PD atrophy. \n\nTo investigate the relationship between regional genetic expression and atrophy, we utilized two large well-validated projects with high quality regional imaging and genetic data. We derived regional PD atrophy patterns from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) component of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) ( ) and regional microarray expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) ( ;  ). As gene expression data is derived from healthy normal subjects, we specifically address whether expression patterns in the normal healthy brain predict PD atrophy. Such expression patterns may represent vulnerability networks or conduits by which PD pathogenesis can occur in the presence of the appropriate initiating factors ( ;  ). Using a similar approach, Romme and colleagues recently showed that expression of schizophrenia-related genes is related to the pattern of cortical disconnectivity ( ), suggesting that relationships between regional genetic expression and brain atrophy in PD may be detectable with our analysis. \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, we find that two genes implicated in synuclein transfer, LAG3 and RAB5A, demonstrate expression patterns that are highly predictive of PD regional atrophy. Furthermore, high expressing LAG3 regions in the occipital cortex exhibit markedly more atrophy in patients with hallucinations, suggesting that this gene may be particularly important in mediating visuospatial disturbances that are often present in PD. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Regional volumetric analysis \n  \nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database ( ). Whole brain PPMI MRI data was utilized for PD (n\u202f=\u202f149 subjects, n\u202f=\u202f378 MR studies) and healthy control (HC, n\u202f=\u202f64 subjects, n\u202f=\u202f127 MR studies) cohorts. Basic subject meta-data is shown in  . Additional details regarding these subjects, including study inclusion and exclusion criteria, are available at the PPMI website ( ). Sagittal 3D T1-weighted MR images were obtained with MPRAGE or SPGR sequences with the following parameters: slice thickness 1.2\u202fmm, slice gap 0\u202fmm, voxel size 1\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.2\u202fmm, and matrix 256\u202f\u00d7\u202f256\u202f\u00d7\u202f170\u2013200. Data were acquired at PPMI centers using scanners from three different manufacturers (GE, Siemens, and Philips). Repetition (TR) and echo (TE) time followed manufacturer recommendations for the relevant sequences. MR images were aligned to an 86 region cortical ( ) and subcortical FreeSurfer ( ) atlas as described by  , and regional volumes were computed using FreeSurfer version 5.1. All analysis was performed with this atlas, and other brain parcellation schemes were not used. MRI scans that did not pass FreeSurfer quality control were excluded from analysis. For this purpose initial FreeSurfer segmentation outputs were rated as \u201cPass\u201d, \u201cPartial\u201d or \u201cFail\u201d by the operator based on visual inspection in the tkmedit tool, as well as the numerical quality flag returned by the FreeSurfer software. Scans that rated either Partial or Fail were excluded from analysis. Regional volumes were normalized by total intracranial volume. Regional atrophy in PD subjects was quantified by the regional atrophy T-score. For healthy cohort regional volume   x   and PD cohort regional volume   y  , with number of samples   n   and   m  , and with variances \u03c3  and \u03c3 , the T-score s is given by the equation  . A violin plot of T-scores was computed and displayed using the Matlab routine   violin   (Holger Hoffman;  ). \n\n\n### Regional gene expression analysis \n  \n17 genes of interest implicated in PD were selected for whole brain expression analysis. The four genes identified as having roles in trans-synaptic synuclein spread in   were analyzed (LAG3, APLP1, NRXN1 and RAB5A). The ten genes with the lowest p-values from the Nalls et al. GWAS meta-analysis for which ABA expression data was available were included: BST1, GBA, GPNMB, HLA-DQB1, LRRK2, MAPT, NUCKS1, SNCA, STK39 and TMEM175. Genetic data for MCC1 and TMEM229B was not available. The three genes strongly associated with typical autosomal recessive PD ( ) were also included (PINK1, PARK2 and PARK7). Comparison models were created from 51 Alzheimer disease related genes, comprising: ADAM10, ADRA1D, ADRA1A, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRB1, ADRBK2, AP2A2, AP2B1, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, APOE, APP, BDNF, AP2M1, AP2S1, CRYAB, DBH, FKBP5, FOS, GSK3A, GSK3B, DNAJA1, HSPA1A, HSPA1L, HSPA5, HSPB1, JUN, MAOA, MAOB, MAPT, MTF1, PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PRNP, SLC6A2, THY1, ALDH1A2, BAG3, HS3ST2, STUB1, ALDH1L1, AP005668.1, CDC37, BACE1, HSPB8, CDC37L1, PDGFC, and PDGFD ( ). For each gene, data was obtained from the publicly available human ABA ( ). The ABA includes 926 brain regions, with each region having microarray expression levels from a set of 58,692 probes that correspond to 29,181 distinct genes. The 926 brain regions were mapped to the 86 region Desikan FreeSurfer atlas. As the ABA and Desikan atlas are defined in the same stereotactic space, this was done by collecting all sample locations from ABA that fell within the same Desikan region, using the sample coordinates supplied by the ABA. ABA samples within a 1\u202fvoxel margin of gray matter were assigned to the nearest gray matter region. Given the voxel size of 1\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f1.2\u202fmm, the maximum distance to a gray matter region of samples assigned in this way is equal to the length of the voxel diagonal, or 1.85\u202fmm. No cortical samples were assigned to subcortical regions. All samples within the same region were then averaged for each gene. Despite differing probe characteristics, a well validated probe weighting procedure has not been identified, and we chose to simply average all probes corresponding to a single gene. White matter tracts were not mapped and were excluded from analysis as done in previous research that successfully linked gene expression to AD vulnerability ( ). Expression for each gene was averaged for six subject brains. Of these six, four had data from the left hemisphere while the other two had data for both hemispheres. More information on normalization across brain samples can be found at help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/2818165/Normalization_WhitePaper.pdf. \n\n\n### Univariate correlation analysis \n  \nUnivariate correlation of regional gene expression with regional atrophy was quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Multiple comparison correction was performed with the Bonferroni method (17 gene comparisons, with threshold p-value\u202f=\u202f.05/17\u202f=\u202f2.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ). \n\n\n### Robust multivariable regression analysis \n  \nRobust multivariable linear regression was performed with the Matlab routine   robustfit   with atrophy T-score as the dependent variable and average gene expression values (as z-scored expression across all probes and subjects in each brain region) as independent variables. Regression was performed across the entire 86 region atlas. Multiple comparison correction was performed with both Bonferroni method (17 gene comparisons, with threshold p-value\u202f=\u202f.05/17\u202f=\u202f2.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ) and Benjamini-Hochberg method (false discovery rate 0.05). Each method yielded the same significant predictors. Simple multivariable linear regression was performed to estimate overall model R , F, and p-value. Additional robust regression analysis was performed in the same way for left hemisphere data only. \n\nFor comparison to the proposed model, two types of model simulation were performed. Firstly, one million simulated 17 gene models were generated in which the PD-related gene z-scored expression data was randomly permuted across brain regions for each gene. Secondly, one million 17 gene models were derived from a set of 51 Alzheimer related genes. As for the PD-related genes, these AD gene models were normalized by z-scoring expression data for each gene separately. 17 unique genes were randomly selected from the set of 51 genes for each round of simulation. Simple multivariable linear regression was then performed to determine each model R  and summary statistics were generated describing the distribution of simulated model R . \n\n\n### LASSO regression analysis \n  \nLASSO regression ( ) was performed with the MATLAB routine   lasso   with 10 fold cross-validation. A simplified model was obtained by minimizing mean squared error by changing the tuning parameter lambda. \n\n\n### Differential atrophy of highest and lowest expressing regions \n  \nEach significant genetic expression predictor in the full regression model was analyzed by computing the average atrophy T-score for the regions \u226410th percentile of average gene expression (for that gene) and \u226590th percentile of average gene expression. The average T-scores for each percentile group were compared using an unpaired t-test. \n\n\n### Structural covariance analysis \n  \nPairwise Pearson correlation coefficients across all average regional volumes in PD patients were computed. Correlation coefficients were confirmed to be described by a Gaussian distribution. Bonferroni correction was performed across all comparisons (threshold p-value\u202f=\u202f.05\u202f/\u202f((86\u202f\u2217\u202f85)/2)\u202f=\u202f1.37\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ). Correlation coefficients with p-values greater than the threshold p-value were considered to be not statistically significant and were set to 0. The average correlation coefficient across all brain regions was computed (i.e. the mean of the correlation matrix upper triangle, excluding autocorrelation values). The same analysis was performed considering regions with LAG3 expression greater 90th percentile, NUCKS1 expression greater than 90th percentile, and RAB5A regions with expression less than 10th percentile. Gene-specific average correlation coefficients were compared to whole brain average correlation coefficients with an unpaired   t  -test. \n\n\n### Behavioral analysis \n  \nMovement Disorder Society sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) ( ) data was obtained from the PPMI database. The PD cohort was separated into a group with a history of hallucinations and a group without a history of hallucinations. Atrophy T-scores (relative to the HC cohort) for the high expressing LAG3 regions were computed for each of these subgroups. Regional T-scores for subjects with hallucinations were divided by the regional T-scores for subjects without hallucinations to derive the relative T-score change. Average relative T-score changes were calculated for a group comprising the lingual gyrus and cuneus and for another group of other high expressing LAG3 regions excluding these regions. Average relative T-score changes were compared using an unpaired   t  -test. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Regional atrophy \n  \nRegional atrophy in PD subjects was computed across an 86 region atlas with the ultimate goal of determining genetic predictors of the overall atrophy pattern ( ). The occipital lobe was the most atrophic area on average, followed by the temporal lobe and basal ganglia. The parietal and cingulate cortex demonstrated little atrophy.   \nRegional brain atrophy pattern in Parkinson disease.

Three categories of genes are included, as shown in  : four spreading synuclein genes from  , ten top GWAS hits (meta-analysis p-value ranging from ~10  to ~10 ) from  , and the three genes associated with typical autosomal recessive PD ( ). Regional expression for each gene is shown in  . Distinct expression patterns are evident for this set of candidate genes indicating that while these genes may all be involved in PD risk or pathogenesis, there is considerable heterogeneity in gene expression across the brain.   \nRegional genetic expression profiles. For each of the 17 genes of interest, the regional genetic expression profile is shown with a sphere centered on each brain region with radius proportional to the normalized microarray expression value. Gene expression was normalized by the maximum expression value for that gene to allow for comparison of regional patterns across different genes. \n  Fig. 2     \nGenes of interest. Symbols, names and analysis categories for each of the 17 genes of interest used in multivariable analysis. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n### Prediction of regional atrophy by genetic expression profiles \n  \nWe next sought to determine whether regional expression of the genes of interest can predict regional atrophy. Univariate correlation between atrophy T-score and normalized gene expression was computed separately for each gene of interest. After correcting for multiple comparisons none of the univariate correlation coefficients was significant ( ), possibly suggesting that noise obscures underlying relationships between these variables or that the relationship between atrophy and genetic expression is more complex than can be elucidated by univariate analysis.   \nUnivariate correlation between atrophy and genetic expression. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed separately for atrophy T-score and z-scored regional expression of each gene of interest. After multiple comparison correction, none of the univariate correlation coefficients are significant. \n  Table 2   \n\nTo determine whether this is the case, we performed a robust multivariable linear regression analysis with atrophy T-score as the dependent variable and the normalized (z-scored) expression of each of the genes of interest as independent variables. Robust multivariable methods are particularly well suited to detecting underlying relationships between variables in complex datasets by minimizing the effects of outlier bias ( ). Using this approach, we find that LAG3, RAB5A and NUCKS1 are each highly significant predictors of atrophy T-score ( A) even after correcting for multiple comparisons. LAG3 and NUCKS1 expression are positively correlated with atrophy, while RAB5A expression is negatively correlated with atrophy. The overall fit of the regression model was estimated with simple linear regression, yielding R \u202f=\u202f0.42 and p\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 , indicating that regional gene expression explains a considerable amount of variance in the regional atrophy pattern.   \nGenetic predictors of regional atrophy. (A) Regression coefficients and p-values for each gene from a robust multivariable regression model with regional T-score as the dependent variable and regional z-scored expression values for each gene as independent variables. Genes that are bolded remain significant predictors after multiple comparison correction with either Bonferroni or Benjamin-Hochberg methods. (B) Cumulative probability plots of R  from simulated regression models with randomly permuted PD-related genetic expression values across brain regions (purple, n\u202f=\u202f10  simulated models), and random AD-related genes (orange, n\u202f=\u202f10  simulated models), using regional atrophy as the dependent variable. Mean simulated R , and R  from the proposed PD-related gene model, are denoted. (C) Mean T-scores (\u00b1SEM) for the brain regions \u226410th percentile (blue) (n\u202f=\u202f9 regions) or \u226590th percentile (red) (n\u202f=\u202f9 regions) of gene expression for each of the significant predictors in (A). LAG3 high-expressing and low-expressing regions demonstrate significant differences in mean atrophy T-score (NUCKS1, p\u202f=\u202f.69; LAG3, p\u202f=\u202f.045; RAB5A, p\u202f=\u202f.25). \n  Fig. 3   \n\nTo determine the predictive power of other possible genetic models, we first simulated one million 17 gene models by randomly permuting genetic expression values across brain regions for each gene in our proposed model. These simulated models therefore address whether the spatial distribution of gene expression in the proposed model better predicts the atrophy pattern than other possible distributions. Simulated model R  was estimated with simple multivariable linear regression. The simulated model R  is normally distributed with mean of 0.2 and standard deviation of 0.061. As an additional control, we compared our proposed model to one million simulated 17 gene models derived from a set of 51 Alzheimer disease related genes ( , in press). As most of the AD-related genes have not been implicated in PD pathology, the fit of resultant models therefore estimates the predictive power of mostly spurious associations. The AD gene simulated model R  is normally distributed with mean of 0.31 and standard deviation of 0.070. The higher mean R  for these models may be related to roles for some of the AD-related genes in trans-synaptic transmission and protein aggregation, which may be relevant to both AD and PD. The proposed PD gene model outperforms nearly all simulated models, as shown in  B. \n\nBecause all of the six Allen Brain subjects had data from the left hemisphere, and two of the six had data from both hemispheres, we repeated our robust regression analysis using only left hemisphere data. Despite the loss of statistical power from eliminating half of the regions in the analysis, we obtained similar results with LAG3 remaining a highly significant predictor ( ). NUCKS1 and RAB5A had two of the lowest p-values in this analysis (p\u202f=\u202f.033 and p\u202f=\u202f.088), although neither was significant after multiple comparison correction. Because only two subjects had right hemisphere expression data we were unable to analyze the right hemisphere exclusively, although comparison of the two hemispheres may reveal additional laterality-related differences that are functionally relevant. \n\n\n### Differential atrophy of highest and lowest expressing LAG3 regions \n  \nWe further analyzed the expression of significant predictors from the full model by comparing the average atrophy T-score for the highest (\u226590th percentile) and lowest expressing (\u226410th percentile) brain regions for each of the significant predictor genes. Atrophy was significantly greater in high expressing LAG3 regions as compared with low expressing regions ( C). Differences in both NUCKS1 and RAB5A atrophy were not statistically significant, suggesting that while their expression profiles predict atrophy, there is less difference in atrophy at the extremes of expression values. \n\n\n### Genetic predictor selection by LASSO \n  \nTo determine whether a simpler model could be rigorously derived from our full multivariable model, we employed least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) ( ) regression. By changing the tuning parameter lambda, LASSO regression minimizes model mean squared error (MSE) and in the process reduces non- or weakly-predictive independent variable regression coefficient to zero. The most highly predictive variables with non-zero coefficients remain in the model. We hypothesized that this technique should retain the three previously identified highly significant predictors LAG3, RAB5A and NUCKS1 in the simplified model. Indeed, the model with the lowest MSE included only five predictor variables: LAG3, RAB5A, NUCKS1, LRRK2 and PARK2 ( ). Although most variables were eliminated, this model is unlikely to result from overfitting as 10-fold cross-validation was utilized to minimize this possibility. Although LRRK2 and PARK2 were not significant predictors in the full model, these results suggest that they may play a role in regional atrophy, possibly below the resolution of technique in this study. Importantly, these results are consistent with the full robust multivariable regression analysis, in that a small number of independent variables predict regional atrophy.   \nLASSO regression analysis. (A) Model mean squared error (MSE) as a function of the tuning parameter lambda. MSE is minimized with lambda\u202f=\u202f0.080. (B) Gene regression coefficients as a function of lambda. As lambda increases to the value which minimizes model MSE all regression coefficients decay to zero, with the exception of five remaining predictor variables: LAG3, LRRK2, NUCKS1, PARK2, and RAB5A. (C) Gene regression coefficients for the model with minimum MSE. The three significant predictors from the robust regression analysis are shown in bold. \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n### Correlated atrophy of high expressing LAG3 regions \n  \nBecause there was markedly more atrophy in high expressing LAG3 regions, we further assessed these regions for the presence of correlated atrophy. We hypothesized that the presence of correlated atrophy may be due to either the presence of high levels of LAG3, elevated interregional connectivity promoting synuclein transfer, or both. To answer this question, we computed the average pairwise correlation coefficient for high expressing (\u226590th percentile) LAG3 regions, and for the entire brain. Pairwise correlation coefficients measure the strength of correlated volume changes between brain regions across PD subjects. Thus, two brain regions that frequently atrophy together across PD subjects will exhibit a high correlation coefficient. We employed multiple comparison correction to decrease detection of false positive correlations and set correlation coefficients below the significance threshold to zero. The remaining non-zero correlation coefficients therefore represent significant correlated atrophy between two brain regions. The high expressing LAG3 regions exhibited significantly higher average atrophy correlation than that observed across the entire brain ( A\u2013C), suggesting that high levels of LAG3 or differential white matter connectivity may drive coordinated atrophy of these regions. In contrast, neither NUCKS1 high-expressing nor RAB5A low-expressing regions demonstrated correlated atrophy different from that of the whole brain ( C).   \nAtrophy of high expressing LAG3 regions.

The sphere radius centered on each brain region is proportional to microarray expression. Pipes connecting the brain regions are color-coded by the pairwise atrophy correlation between those brain regions using the same color scale as in (B).

LAG3 average r is significantly greater than that for whole brain (p\u202f=\u202f1.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 ), while NUCKS1 and RAB5A average r are not (p\u202f=\u202f.66 and 0.14, respectively). (D) Change in average T-score for subjects with hallucinations versus those without hallucinations. A group comprising the lingual gyrus and cuneus (left) demonstrates a significant difference in T-score across subject groups (p\u202f=\u202f.014), while a group comprising the other high expressing LAG3 regions (right) does not (p\u202f=\u202f.84). \n  Fig. 5   \n\n\n### Hallucinations related to selective atrophy of LAG3 high expressing lingual gyrus and cuneus \n  \nAs the set of high expressing LAG3 regions is enriched in occipital cortical regions, we next sought to determine whether visuospatial processing may be affected by atrophy of these regions. The lingual gyrus and cuneus, in particular, have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of visual hallucinations ( ). To this end, we analyzed MDS-UPDRS data in the same cohort of PD patients. We hypothesized that the lingual gyrus and cuneus would exhibit more atrophy in subjects reporting hallucinations than in those that have not experienced hallucinations. We combined data from these two brain regions and computed the change in T-score across subject groups. As predicted, the average atrophy T-score for these brain regions is approximately 4-fold greater in subjects with hallucinations ( D). In contrast, there was no difference in average atrophy for the other high expressing LAG3 regions across these subject subgroups. These findings support the hypothesis that dysfunction of the lingual gyrus and cuneus is related to visuospatial disturbance. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study we used the PPMI and ABA databases to characterize the regional PD atrophy pattern with high spatial resolution, and to identify genes with expression patterns that are significantly predictive of regional atrophy. Similar to other groups, we found that there is atrophy of both cortical and subcortical brain regions ( ;  ;  ). The basal ganglia are notably atrophic, the degree of which may correlate with the degree of motor impairment ( ). However, we found that the occipital and temporal lobes demonstrate even more atrophy. The prominence of posterior cortical atrophy has been described in prior studies, such as by Tinaz et al. in which these areas were shown to exhibit disproportionate cortical thinning ( ). These findings reinforce the importance of non-motor symptoms that often reduce quality of life for PD patients, such as the cognitive and memory deficits that correlate with temporal atrophy ( ); and the visuospatial deficits that correlate with occipital atrophy ( ). \n\nWe found that there are multiple genes in the normal brain with expression patterns that are highly correlated with the PD regional atrophy pattern. A certain number of genes in the human genome are expected to have regional expression profiles similar to that of the PD atrophy pattern purely by chance. Our approach to identifying genes with expression causally related to PD atrophy was designed to be highly stringent to minimize the likelihood of identifying these false positive genes. To that end, we analyzed only genes with high a priori probabilities of being involved in PD pathogenesis. We used robust regression analysis to minimize the influence of outlier data, stringent multiple comparison correction, LASSO feature selection, and large scale model simulation, to identify our small subset of candidate genes comprising LAG3, NUCKS1, and RAB5A. Because these gene expression patterns exist in the normal healthy brain, it is possible that PD utilizes these normal patterns of expression as conduits for spatial propagation after disease initiation has occurred. \n\nThe power of combining imaging data with ABA genetic expression data has also been recently demonstrated by other groups. For example, Rittman et al. compared genetic expression with regional brain connectivity in PD and found that synuclein expression did not correlate with loss of functional connectivity ( ). In an imaging-genetic expression study of schizophrenia, Romme et al. showed that particular classes of schizophrenia-related genes had expression profiles that correlated with brain disconnectivity ( ). This group used a slightly different analysis approach, in which multiple genes within a certain gene class, such as synaptic function, were separately correlated with the brain disconnectivity pattern. Using this approach, particular gene classes were shown to be more predictive of brain disconnectivity than others, providing important mechanistic insight into schizophrenia pathogenesis. Along similar lines, Powell et al. recently showed that the DISC1 genetic expression profile is associated with age-related changes in white matter disconnectivity in schizophrenia ( ). Other studies have found that genetic expression poorly predicts brain pathology. For example, the Alzheimer disease atrophy pattern is poorly explained by single AD-related genetic expression profiles, despite accurate prediction of spreading dysfunction by trans-synaptic mechanisms ( , in press). \n\nOne of the atrophy-predictive genes in our study, NUCKS1, is a highly significant predictor of PD risk in GWAS studies. NUCKS1, a gene involved in DNA damage response ( ), is positively correlated with atrophy. Little is known about the function of NUCKS1. However, its role in DNA damage response suggests that it could be involved in cell-autonomous pathology that contributes to dysfunction when regional accumulation of synuclein mediated damage occurs. The two other genes with expression correlated with regional atrophy, LAG3 and RAB5A, are genes that are implicated in trans-synaptic synuclein transfer. LAG3 expression is positively correlated with atrophy, while RAB5A expression is negatively correlated with atrophy. Elevated LAG3 levels may contribute to regional dysfunction and atrophy by promoting binding and endocytosis of extracellular synuclein preformed fibrils ( ). Increasing the intracellular concentration of synuclein has deleterious effects such as interference with mitochondrial fusion ( ) and reduction of neurotransmitter release by inhibition of synaptic vesicle clustering ( ). In contrast, RAB5A may act as a protective factor, possibly by sequestering synuclein or promoting its disposal within the cell. The role of RAB5A as an important mediator of endocytic pathways ( ) positions it to potentially control the transport of synuclein inside the cell. \n\nOther well validated PD risk factors such as synuclein itself, tau, GBA and the PARK genes ( ) do not have expression patterns similar to that of the PD atrophy pattern, suggesting that these genes may serve as initiation factors rather than determinants of disease propagation. Particularly intriguing is the absence of a correlation of SNCA expression with the regional atrophy pattern. There is ample evidence that increasing gene dosage of SNCA by duplication or triplication causes familial cases of Parkinson disease, possibly by increasing the prevalence of pathological aggregates of synuclein ( ). However, our results suggest that normal expression patterns of SNCA do not predict the ultimate regional pattern of degeneration. These results are concordant with another recent study in which synuclein expression did not correlate with loss of functional connectivity in PD ( ). One hypothesis that reconciles these findings is that increasing synuclein expression may initiate disease in one or several brain regions, while additional pathways, potentially including LAG3 and RAB5A, control regional propagation. Similar arguments may apply to other risk factors such as GBA, tau and PARK genes. \n\nThe identification of LAG3 and RAB5A as the genes with expression most highly associated with regional atrophy strongly indicates that PD atrophy patterns are mainly dependent on cell non-autonomous function, rather than impairment of cell-autonomous function. This provides indirect support to the emerging concept - based on histopathological studies - that most proteinopathies, including PD, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, spread in stereotypical patterns from one brain region to another ( ). Multiple studies suggest that misfolded synuclein can spread via a trans-neuronal \u201cprion-like\u201d mechanism, as can other proteins such as tau, beta-amyloid, TDP-43 and Huntingtin, which are implicated in Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia and Huntington disease, respectively ( ;  ;  ;  ). Misfolded proteins trigger misfolding of same-species proteins by a   corruptive templating   process, which in turn is thought to cascade along neuronal pathways ( ,  ). \n\nTransmission of misfolded synuclein is thought to follow network projections, thus suggesting that connectivity is a determinant of susceptibility. Our group was one of the first to demonstrate that a connectivity-based model of spread, encoded in a graph-theoretic network-diffusion model, was able to capture the brain-wide pattern of trans-neuronal spread in Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia ( ). Similar conclusions were also made in a study using functional connectivity networks ( ). Given our current findings, in which the most highly implicated genes are involved in pathology transfer between cells, it is likely that a similar non-cell autonomous process is involved in PD pathophysiology. \n\nThe occipital cortex is selectively enriched in high expressing LAG3 regions, which may be particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of the visuospatial deficits that are prominent features of PD in some patients ( ). Indeed, we found that patients reporting hallucinations demonstrated markedly more atrophy of the cuneus and lingual gyrus, two higher order visual processing centers. These findings also provide support to the hypothesis that the LAG3 pathway mediating synuclein transfer may be closely related to PD pathology. \n\nBecause the relevant gene expression patterns are present in the normal brain, it may be possible to target LAG3 and RAB5A in a pre-symptomatic or early stage of the disease. In this context, decreasing LAG3 function, or increasing RAB5A function, may be therapeutically beneficial. Multiple LAG3 antagonists are currently in clinical trials, primarily as adjuncts to other forms of cancer immunotherapy ( ). One of these trials is designed to assess responses of glioblastoma to anti-LAG3 monoclonal antibodies ( , trial ID  ), suggesting that anti-LAG3 mAb may be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. If these agents prove safe in initial studies, it may be warranted to attempt a small clinical trial in PD patients. We predict that inhibition of LAG3 function may impede the spread of synuclein and possibly slow the progression of disease. \n\nDespite identifying several gene predictors of spatial atrophy, there are several limitations to our approach which we hope to address with future work. The first is that while we study a subset of genes with high a priori probability of being involved in regional atrophy patterning, there are genes which may be involved which are not included in our analysis. Although there are methodological issues with including larger number of genes in our analysis (e.g. multiple comparisons and increased false negative detection), there are probably other genes excluded from our analysis which play a functional role in the spatial propagation of disease. As we learn more about the spread of PD pathology throughout the brain, we hope to further leverage our combined imaging-genetic approach to identify additional genes important in this process. For instance, analysis of additional endocytosis-related genes which may regulate trans-synaptic alpha-synuclein transfer, and genes controlling alpha-synuclein aggregation may be particularly promising. \n\nAnother limitation of our approach is related to the specificity of the ABA genetic expression data. Although there are multiple expression probes for each gene of interest, the specificity of some of these probes has been questioned. For example, one of the four MAPT probes has been reported to have only 88% homology to the MAPT gene ( ). We did not attempt to correct for probe non-specificity, and for completeness have included all available ABA probes for all genes. Further investigation of appropriateness criteria for probe inclusion, exclusion and differential weighting for studies using ABA data is warranted. \n\nThe third important limitation of our study is that imaging and genetic data are derived from different subject populations. While we are able to use high quality imaging data for PD subjects, no data similar to the ABA exists for this population. The incredibly resource intensive creation of the ABA from a small number of healthy subjects underscores how difficult it currently remains to derive similar data from subjects within specific disease populations. For that reason, we are limited to comparing genetic expression from healthy subjects and atrophy data from PD subjects. It is possible that genetic expression patterns are altered in important ways in PD subjects, but we cannot answer that question with our current resources. Based on our results, we hypothesize that PD pathogenesis exploits pre-existing genetic expression networks present in healthy people, but further investigation is required in this area. Identification of such disease-enabling networks in the healthy brain may be extremely important, as these networks may be amenable to prophylactic or therapeutic manipulation in pre-disease or early disease states. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5984599, "text_md5": "90dec4d7d3219c97e01f55cee0b65af4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 83], "journal": [84, 99], "publication_year": [101, 105], "title": [116, 241], "keywords": [255, 341], "abstract": [354, 1906], "body": [1915, 40891]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29868450, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2018.01.009", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984599", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5984599"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984599\">5984599</a>", "list_title": "PMC5984599  Regional expression of genes mediating trans-synaptic alpha-synuclein transfer predicts regional atrophy in Parkinson disease"}

This paper aims to establish correlations between articulation disorders in PD patients and factors such as the patients\u2019 sex, age, education and residence. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study included 92 patients with idiopathic PD diagnosed by means of multiple neurological examinations, biochemical tests, MRI and CT scanning carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria. A speech and language test involved the assessment of the mobility of the speech organs as well as the reflexes inside the oral cavity. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment was applied for an objective evaluation of dysarthria. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe study revealed the existence of significant relationship between the functionality of articulators in PD patients and their education and residence. Big city dwellers demonstrated lower incidence of disorders within speech organs, particularly those affecting mobility of the soft palate while eating. Disorders of moderate intensity were more frequently found in subjects living in villages. Subjects with a university education displayed better position of the lips at rest and better performance of both lips and the mandible while speaking. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAbnormal functioning of the articulatory organs was observed more frequently in PD patients residing in rural areas than in those inhabiting urban areas. As for education, our cohort university graduates displayed a better position of the lips at rest and better performance of the lips and jaw during speaking than those with secondary and vocational education. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most frequently occurring neurodegenerative conditions of the central nervous system. In many cases its onset is heralded by gradually increasing speech decline. Speech disorders in PD are normally associated with the pathogenetic conditioning of the disease, particularly bradykinesia and rigidity. Speech and voice evaluation is usually carried out in the context of duration and severity of the disease as well as L-dopa dosage [ \u2013 ]. \n\nSo far a limited number of studies evaluating speech disturbances in PD patients have been documented and published. Some researchers focused mainly on the abnormality of movement within the lips and jaw [ \u2013 ]. It was established that the slowness of the lower lip movement was related to dysarthric articulation disorders. Other researchers claimed that PD constitutes a factor contributing to the impairment in the mobility of the speech organs [ \u2013 ]. Reduced stability of movement coordination in the speech organs in PD patients was also shown [ ]. \n\nAvailable publications describing speech disorders in PD patients in the context of demographic or social circumstances such as sex, age, education or place of residence, provide inconclusive results [ ]. PD generally prevails in the elderly with the mean age of 58\u00a0years. Elderly people tend to be afflicted with speech disorders due to anatomic changes, loss of teeth and lower muscle tone [ ,  ]. It has been established that PD patients lose the loudness of voice with age [ ]. Other studies of voice loudness in PD patients indicate that there is a connection between patients\u2019 age and pitch lowering [ ]. The latest research into the performance of the articulatory organs carried out on elderly subjects and PD patients in an initial stage of the disease shows that there is no difference between those groups [ ]. Studies into the relationship between sex and the severity of articulatory disorders in PD patients also provided ambiguous results. \n\nSome researchers point to the existence of differences between the loudness of vowels uttered by male and female PD patients. \n\nSeveral studies demonstrated that the incidence of PD in ethnic groups populating the same place is similar, but may vary depending on the geographical location of the place [ ,  ]. It is assumed that living in the countryside contributes to a higher incidence of PD [ ,  ]. This is associated with the impact of environmental factors. We attempted to find out whether those factors could also be responsible for speech deterioration in PD or an early onset of the articulatory organs disorders in PD patients. \n\nA limited number of papers which would attempt to analyse the course of PD in patients of various educational backgrounds encouraged us to look into this unexplored question. Patients with a university education tend to make more effort to preserve their communication skills and overall bodily fitness. They are also less likely to display deterioration of cognitive functions [ ,  ]. A better education normally means a higher economic status, better quality of life and a better access to healthcare [ ]. Hence, it can be assumed that the quality of articulation in well-educated PD patients will be different from that in their less educated counterparts. Any publications on the relationship between the severity of articulation impairment in PD and the patients\u2019 residence are also hard to come by. \n\nSome researchers claim that articulation disorders in PD are caused by progression of the disease [ ]. Further research into the issue seems to be well worthwhile as the ambiguities concerning the functioning of the articulatory organs and the risk factors responsible for their deterioration are numerous. Looking into the correlation between the incidence of the articulatory organs disorders and variables like sex, age, place of residence or education might help to understand the specifics of the symptoms better, give a more effective diagnosis and plan the rehabilitation of PD patients more effectively. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study was carried out on a cohort of 92 patients with diagnosed idiopathic PD who met the following criteria: age over 40, lack of significant psychotic changes, able stadium 1-4 on a scale M.M. Hoehn and M.D. Yahr (H&Y), no stupor symptoms present, retained L-dopa response, absence of clinical depression or mood disorders other than those relating to the \u2018off\u2019 phase. Criteria of exclusion included: undergone deep brain stimulation procedure (DBS), substantial discoordination of movement deficit, acute dyskinesias, pathological changes in the larynx, cognitive functions disorders (the Mini Mental State Examination scale was applied and subjects who scored \u226424 points were excluded from the cohort), other neurological diseases. \n\nThe study group contained 33 women (35.9%), and 59 men (64.1%), aged between 26 and 86 (mean age 65.2). 55 (59.8%) were big city dwellers, 24 (26.1%) lived in towns and 13 (14.1%) in villages. Seventeen patients had a university education, 28 (30.4%) completed secondary schools, 30 (32.6%) were trade school graduates and the remaining 17 (18.5%) received a primary education. \n\n### Data collection \n  \nPD was diagnosed by means of multiple neurological examinations, biochemical tests, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Computed tomographic (CT) scanning in accordance with the United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria. Duration of the illness, measured from the occurrence of the first symptoms of PD, varied from 1\u00a0month to 27\u00a0years (mean length 7.5\u00a0years). Further examination of the group using the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) produced scores ranging between 10 and 70 pts. (mean score 37.2 pts.). The study subjects had not received any neurological speech therapy. Daily intake of L-dopa ranged from 150 to 2000\u00a0mg (mean dosage 570.9\u00a0mg). \n\nThe data concerning gender, age, education and place of residence were collected by means of our own questionnaire. \n\nPerformance of the articulatory organs was assessed by means the standardized scale Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA). One of the most important tests for evaluating articulation organs is the FDA. The FDA is a standardized test which relies on a 9-point rating scale applied to a patient. It provides information based on the observation of the oral structures, functions and speech. It has good feasibility (missing data <5%), a high reliability of the total score (0.94), an excellent inter-rater agreement for the total score (0.96) and moderate to large construct validity for 81% of its items. It is well correlated with the gold standard for disease severity assessment in PD, the Movement Disorder Society -Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (MDS-UPDRS). The test evaluates the following functions: saliva control, swallowing, breathing, tongue movements, lips, the soft palate, the jaw, length of phonation as well as the pitch and loudness of voice. A 5-point rating scale (a \u2013 e) is used for the assessment, where letter \u2018a\u2019 represents norm, \u2018b\u2019 mild severity, \u2018c\u2019 moderate, \u2018d\u2019 considerable severity, \u2018e\u2019 profound severity. FDA is also used to assess the severity of the articulatory organs disorders and to monitor the effects of treatment [ ]. The test was conducted by a clinical speech therapist with 12\u00a0years experience of treating neurological conditions, predominantly PD. We used an older version of the test because of the jaw test, which currently is not available in the updated version. \n\nPatients with considerable deviation from the norm were referred for laryngological consultations so that any other conditions within the speech organs could be ruled out. \n\nThe subjects were examined in \u2018OFF\u2019 phase. Patients are considered to be ON when medication is working and OFF when the benefit abates. Some scales assess motor manifestations or complications of treatment, and ratings may vary tremendously depending upon whether observations are recorded during the ON or OFF phase for those with such medication-induced fluctuations [ ]. \n\nThe study was approved by the Pomeranian Medical University Commission \u2013 of Ethics -Resolution no KB-0012/07/10. \n\n#### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe distribution of continuous variable (age) was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. To verify whether speech and language test results were determined by selected socio-demographical indices \u03c7  (relation to gender, place of residence and level of education), Kruskall-Wallis or Mann-Whitney (in relation to age) tests were applicated, as appropriate. The statistical significance was adopted at two-side   P   value <0.05. All statistical analyses for this study were performed using the StatView computer software version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) [ ,  ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe successfully conducted speech and language evaluations in all patients (  n  \u2009=\u200992, 100%) recruited for the study. We found no association between the sex and age of the study participants and each determinant of the mobility of the speech organs as well as the reflexes inside the oral cavity. The results are presented in Tables\u00a0  and   respectively.   \nStudy group characteristics \n    \nThe association between age and particular speech determinants in the study group by means of Kruskall-Wallis test \n  \n\nStatistical analyses proved that the place of residence determines only the evaluation of the palate while eating (  p  \u2009=\u20090.017). A majority of big town dwellers (  n  \u2009=\u200943, 78%) demonstrated normal movement of the vocal organs. By contrast, a mild disorder of speech organs occurred in 61% of village residents. Detailed results are presented in Table\u00a0 . Furthermore, we found that a better education background of the patients corresponded with higher performance of the lips at rest, in motion and while speaking spontaneously as well as more efficient motion of the lower jaw in speech (0.0002; 0.0252; 0.0105; 0.0333 respectively) (Tables\u00a0  and  ).   \nThe speech tests results in terms of gender calculated by \u03c7  analyses.

Data are presented as number of cases \n  \n*-statistically significant \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nSpeech disorders in PD tend to vary in character and often have an early onset. Due to such a considerable variety and individual pattern of the disorders it seems advisable to consider all factors contributing to their presence [ ]. Assessment of the relationship between age, educational background, sex and place of residence appears to be an important element determining further treatment of PD patients, particularly the non-pharmacological one. \n\nDocumented results of research analysing the association between articulation efficiency in PD patients and their age are scarce and controversial [ ,  ,  ]. A group of elderly healthy subjects were compared to a group of younger PD patients. The former were found to have a lower mobility of the jaw and lips than their younger counterparts [ ,  ]. Other studies, however, did not confirm the findings [ ]. Also, an analysis of similar articulation regions in PD patients of various ages showed that the older patients have lower mobility within the jaw, which consequently affects the quality of respiratory and phonation functions [ ]. \n\nOur study however revealed no correlation between age and the performance of the speech organs. \n\nWe carried out the research in an attempt to establish the impact of educational background on the efficiency of speech organs. No relevant scientific publications are available in existing literature. We found that highly educated patients tended to display increased efficiency in proper positioning of the lips at rest, a lower severity of disorders affecting the movements of the vocal organs and lower jaw during the production of speech. This might be due to a higher communicative awareness prevailing in the group, which results in more care being taken to proper movement of the speech organs. The likelihood of PD patients controlling their speech has been mentioned by other authors [ ]. This feature probably contributes to an increased ability to correct articulation inaccuracies among highly educated patients. \n\nIt has been scientifically proven that the course of PD in males is not the same as in females. Recent research has revealed that men are more likely than women to lose their voice loudness and the quality of speech. They also take more pauses while speaking [ ] and display disturbed prosody [ ,  ]. Evaluation of the efficiency of the larynx in men and women showed that women display a higher incidence of phonation disorders, glottis insufficiency and frequent laryngeal tremor. The differences might be attributed to a possibly faster progression of the disease in men as well as an increased number of abnormalities within the articulatory organs. \n\nAcoustic voice analysis in PD patients confirmed the difference between the fundamental frequency in men and women [ ]. The study revealed that there is no difference between the performance of the articulatory organs in men and women [ \u2013 ]. \n\nWe were also first to try to establish the existence of a link between the efficiency of the speech organs in PD patients and their place of residence. Our study revealed that city dwellers displayed significantly better performance of the soft palate while eating, which probably results from the fact that those patients tend to take a better care of proper verbal expression, articulation, or are better educated. It could also be that they have better access to medical treatment and medication control, just because healthcare is better in urban areas. \n\nIt may be also connected with a higher incidence of PD in rural areas. The use of pesticides and presence of heavy metals in well water are often quoted as contributory environmental factors of PD incidence in human population. Since well water is hardly ever used for consumption in Poland, pesticides and heavy metals might account for the main threat. Exposure to environmental risk factors might accelerate the onset of PD disorders, which in turn results in a higher prevalence of impaired mobility of the articulatory organs [ \u2013 ]. \n\nA higher number of abnormalities in the functioning of the articulatory organs occurring among the residents of rural areas might result from a poorer access to healthcare, and consequently delays in starting proper treatment [ \u2013 ]. \n\nOur study of the impact of environmental factors on the severity of the articulatory organs disorders in PD individuals is by no means exhaustive. It is just an introduction to further research based on more precise and accurate methodology. However, detecting the small changes in the articulatory organs might contribute to an early diagnosis of PD. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe study revealed significant association between the functionality of articulators in PD patients and their educational background and place of residence. Big city dwellers demonstrated lower incidence of disorders within speech organs, particularly those affecting mobility of the soft palate while eating. Disorders of moderate intensity were more frequently found in subjects living in villages. Subjects with university education displayed better position of the lips at rest and better performance of both the lips and the mandible while speaking. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5740885, "text_md5": "8fb8a5c76aad7d10b8d28182d3c1cd07", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 122], "journal": [123, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 274], "keywords": [288, 335], "abstract": [348, 2078], "body": [2087, 17752]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29268713, "doi": "10.1186/s12883-017-1003-2", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740885", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5740885"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740885\">5740885</a>", "list_title": "PMC5740885  The analysis of relationship between selected sociodemografic factors and disorders of speech organs in Parkinson`s patients"}

The objective of this study was to investigate   PP  2A in   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe compared the state of   PP  2A methylation, as well as the expression of its methylating enzyme, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (  LCMT  \u20101), and demethylating enzyme, protein phosphatase methylesterase (  PME  \u20101), in postmortem brains from   PD   and   DLB   cases as well as age\u2010matched Controls. Immunohistochemical studies and quantitative image analysis were employed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n LCMT  \u20101 was significantly reduced in the substantia nigra (  SN  ) and frontal cortex in both   PD   and   DLB  .   PME  \u20101, on the other hand, was elevated in the   PD SN  . In concert with these changes, the ratio of methylated   PP  2A to demethylated   PP  2A was markedly decreased in   PD   and   DLB   brains in both   SN   and frontal cortex. No changes in total   PP  2A or total B55  \u03b1   subunit were detected. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nThese findings support the hypothesis that   PP  2A dysregulation in   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies may contribute to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein and to the disease process, raising the possibility that pharmacological means to enhance   PP  2A phosphatase activity may be a useful disease\u2010modifying therapeutic approach. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nProtein phosphorylation is a tightly regulated posttranslational modification that impacts nearly all cellular processes. A balance is normally maintained through the actions of multiple kinases and phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously expressed conserved enzyme, with its catalytic C subunit constituting up to 1% of total cellular proteins, and accounts for the majority of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in the brain. ,   In neuronal cells, most of the C subunit is associated with a conserved scaffold\u2010like A subunit, and one of several different regulatory B subunits that confer different substrate specificities on the resulting trimeric holoenzymes. The binding of different B subunits to the AC dimer is regulated by reversible carboxyl methylation of the C subunit. ,  ,   Thus, PP2A methylation is critical for its selective phosphatase activity toward different phospho\u2010protein substrates. The methylation status of PP2A is governed by the opposing activities of a PP2A\u2010specific leucine carboxyl methyltransferase (LCMT\u20101) and a PP2A\u2010specific methylesterase (PME\u20101). ,  ,  \n\n \u03b1  \u2010Synuclein is an abundant protein in the brain that misfolds and polymerizes into fibrillar form in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are pathologic hallmarks of   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).  \u03b1  \u2010Synuclein is extensively phosphorylated at Ser  in PD and DLB brains. ,  ,   Additionally, hyperphosphorylated and misfolded   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein accumulates in neurons of transgenic mice that express human   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein, ,   and hyperphosphorylation exacerbates   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein toxicity in   Drosophila  .  In vitro, phosphorylation of   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein at Ser  promotes its oligomerization and fibrillization. \n\nWe demonstrated previously in in vitro experiments and in cultured neuroblastoma cells that the main enzyme that dephosphorylates   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein is the B55  \u03b1   containing isoform of PP2A.  We also identified a naturally occurring serotonin derivative in coffee, eicosanoyl\u20105\u2010hydroxytryptamide (EHT), that inhibits PME\u20101\u2010dependent PP2A demethylation, thereby stabilizing the PP2A heterotrimeric holoenzyme AB55  \u03b1  C that dephosphorylates   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein.   \u03b1  \u2010Synuclein transgenic mice maintained on a diet supplemented with EHT exhibited dramatically reduced   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation in the brain, accompanied with enhanced neuronal integrity and reduced neuroinflammation as well as improved motor performance. \n\nBased on these preclinical observations, we hypothesized that alterations in PP2A methylation may contribute to the pathology of human   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies.,  particularly in light of decreased PP2A activity reported in the brains of individuals with DLB and   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein triplication.  Abnormal regulation of PP2A has been noted in another neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD), with decreased phosphatase activity and reduced PP2A methylation in postmortem brains. ,   Furthermore, PP2A has been shown to be the major phosphatase acting on phospho\u2010tau,  and EHT ameliorates the neurodegenerative phenotype in a rat model of AD. \n\nThis study examines the state of PP2A methylation in postmortem brains of patients with PD and DLB as well as the expression of the two enzymes that control PP2A methylation, LCMT\u20101, and PME\u20101. The results show robust abnormalities compared to control brains consistent with compromised PP2A activity that can contribute to an abnormally elevated phosphorylation state of   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein in these disorders. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Brain samples \n  \nHuman postmortem brain tissue sections that were fully characterized clinically and neuropathologically were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program of Sun City, Arizona.  Deidentified samples from eight subjects in each of the diagnostic groups consisting of Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and non\u2010neurological controls (Controls) were studied (Table  ). The three groups were age\u2010matched with mean age at death of 79 \u00b1 2.8 years for PD cases, 82 \u00b1 2.6 years for DLB, and 84 \u00b1 2.1 years for Controls (not significant). Gender distribution was equal for both PD and DLB cases, while the Control group included five males and three females. Only one PD case had a positive family history of tremor. Family history among DLB cases included two AD, two others dementia, and one tremor. All PD cases were tested for glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and LRRK2 mutations; three were found to have GBA mutations, and one had LRRK2 mutation. None of these GBA or LRRK2 mutants had positive family history. Postmortem interval (PMI) was \u22643 h in all but one PD subject. United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores in the \u201cpractically\u2010defined off state\u201d in all but three subjects were 39.4 \u00b1 8.5 for PD, 35.7 \u00b1 11.4 for DLB, and 10.4 \u00b1 4.3 for Controls (  P   < 0.05 for difference between PD and Controls). Mean Mini\u2010Mental State Examination scores were 18 \u00b1 3.6 in the PD group, 8.8 \u00b1 3.1 in DLB and 27.1 \u00b1 0.8 in Controls (  P   < 0.01 for difference between DLB and Controls). Lewy bodies were detected in PD and DLB brains but in none of the Controls. Neuropathological stage of   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathy assigned according to the Unified Staging System for Lewy Body Disorders   showed all DLB cases to be in stage 4, PD cases ranged from stages 2 to 4, and all the Controls were in stage zero. All PD\u2010affected brains had severe depigmentation of the substantia nigra, while those with DLB had mild to moderate depigmentation, and all but one Control had no or mild depigmentation.  Concomitant Alzheimer pathology was also present. Mean neuritic plaque density determined according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD)   was 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 for PD, 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 for DLB, and 1.0 \u00b1 0 for Controls (  P   = 0.001 for difference between DLB and Controls, and   P   < 0.01 for PD vs. DLB), and neurofibrillary tangles assessed using Braak staging   showed mean scores of 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 for PD, 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 for DLB, and 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 for Controls (  P   = 0.01 for difference between DLB and Controls, and   P   < 0.05 for PD vs. DLB). Demographic and neuropathological details are provided in Table  . \n  \nPostmortem brain tissue samples, and the clinical and neuropathologic profile of study subjects \n    \n\n### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nFor immunohistochemical analysis, 40   \u03bc  m free\u2010floating formalin\u2010fixed sections of the substantia nigra and middle frontal gyrus of the cerebral cortex stored at 4\u00b0C were used. After washing with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), tissue sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. To enhance epitope antigenicity, samples were incubated in preheated sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for 30 min at 75\u00b0C. Sections were then blocked using 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: antibody for LCMT\u20101 (also known as PPMT) (1:100, a kind gift from Egon Ogris) ; 07\u2010095 for PME\u20101 (1:500, Millipore); 6A3 for methylated\u2010PP2A (1:200, generated at Princeton University) ; 1D6 for demethylated\u2010PP2A (1:1000; Millipore) ; 06\u2010222 for total PP2A C subunit (1:500, Millipore); and 2G9 for total B55  \u03b1   subunit of PP2A (1:500, Millipore). Sections were washed with PBS\u2010Tween (PBS\u2010T) three times and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing again with PBS\u2010T, sections were incubated with biotinylated HRP complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine (DAB) for color development. Hematoxylin\u2010stained adjacent sections of the substantia nigra (SN) were used to count neuromelanin\u2010containing neurons. All samples across different diagnostic groups were stained under the same conditions. For image analysis, tissue sections were observed under a Nikon Eclipse 55i light microscope, images were captured using NIS\u2010Elements D software (Nikon), and the area occupied by immunoreaction in each image was quantified using the thresholding tool in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The mean areas for each disease group were then compared to that of the Control group. Signals in the SN were normalized against the density of residual neuromelan\u2010containing neurons. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nGraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis and graphic representation. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. Differences among the three groups in the levels of LCMT\u20101, PME\u20101, methylated PP2A, demethylated PP2A, total PP2A, and B55  \u03b1   were analyzed using one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Differences in clinical and demographic characteristics (age, Mini\u2010Mental State Examination, postmortem interval, motor UPDRS, Braak stage, and neuritic plaque density) were analyzed using Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA with post hoc Dunn's multiple comparison test.   P   < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA marked decrease in the area occupied by immunoreaction for the PP2A methylating enzyme LCMT\u20101 was found in the SN of both PD and DLB brains, and a lesser, but still significant, decrease was detected in the cortex of both diseases in comparison to Controls (Fig.  ). In SN, LCMT\u20101 immunoreaction was decreased by 63% in PD (  P   < 0.0001) and 55% in DLB (  P   < 0.0001), while in the cortex, this was reduced by 30% in PD (  P   < 0.01) and by 28% in DLB (  P   < 0.01) compared to Controls. Conversely, the demethylating enzyme PME\u20101 was elevated in the SN in PD (  P   < 0.01) but not in DLB, and a trend to increased levels was noted in cortex in both disease groups (  P   = 0.05 for a 76% increase in PD vs. Controls;   P   = 0.17 for a 60% increase in DLB vs. Controls) (Fig.  ). As LCMT\u20101 and PME\u20101 signals were normalized against the number of residual melanized neurons, and PME\u20101 expression is increased in the SN, these findings indicate that the observed decrease in LCMT\u20101 expression in SN (Fig.  ) is not explained by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the marked decrease in LCMT\u20101 in the SN of both PD and DLB, despite only mild to moderate depigmentation in the latter, also suggests that neuronal loss cannot adequately account for the decrease in LCMT\u20101 expression in these conditions. \n  \nComparison of   LCMT  \u20101 expression in Parkinson disease (  PD  ), dementia with Lewy bodies (  DLB  ), and Control brains.

Tissue sections from the substantia nigra (A\u2013D) and middle frontal gyrus of the cerebral cortex (E\u2013H) were immunohistochemically stained for   PME  \u20101. (A\u2013C) Representative images of   PME  \u20101 immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra. (D) Optical density values for   PME  \u20101 staining intensity in the nigra, normalized against the number of neuromelanin\u2010containing neurons, in Controls (  n   = 8),   PD   (  n   = 7), and   DLB   (  n   = 8). ** ANOVA   P   < 0.01 compared to Controls.

None of the differences were significant. Scale bar = 100   \u03bc  m. \n  \nIn agreement with the robust decrease in LCMT\u20101 expression in the SN of both PD and DLB brains, and increased PME\u20101 expression in PD, methylated PP2A expression was markedly down\u2010regulated in SN in both conditions compared to Controls (Fig.  ). Methyl\u2010PP2A was reduced by 70% in PD (  P   < 0.001) and by 73% in DLB (  P   < 0.0001) (Fig.  A\u2013D), while no significant differences were detected in the levels of demethylated PP2A (Fig.  E\u2013H). Total PP2A expression (Fig.  J\u2013M), and total B55  \u03b1   subunit levels were no different among the three groups (Fig.  N\u2013Q). The finding that the proportion of methylated PP2A out of total PP2A is decreased by 60% in PD (  P   < 0.01) and by 65% in DLB SN (  P   < 0.001) compared to Controls (Fig.  D) indicates that the catalytically active form of PP2A is diminished due to a decrease in its methylating enzyme LCMT\u20101 (Fig.  ), with contribution from increased expression of the methylesterase PME\u20101 (Fig.  ). As all these analyses are normalized against the number of neuromelanin\u2010containing neurons, the decrease in LCMT\u20101 expression represents a pathologic marker and not a reflection of dopaminergic neuronal loss in these conditions. Furthermore, the pathologic imbalance of the methylation state of PP2A is evident from the marked decrease in the ratio between methylated PP2A and demethylated PP2A in the SN in both PD and DLB brains (Fig.  I). Interestingly, a case with PD and homozygous N370S GBA mutation had the lowest level of methylated PP2A. However, the small numbers of cases analyzed in this study preclude making conclusions about a possible link between genetic background and PP2A dysregulation. \n  \nImmunoreactivity patterns of methylated\u2010  PP  2A, demethylated\u2010  PP  2A, total   PP  2A, and total B55  \u03b1   subunit in the substantia nigra of Parkinson disease (  PD  ), dementia with Lewy bodies (  DLB  ), and Control brains. Tissue sections from the substantia nigra were immunohistochemically stained using antibodies against methylated\u2010  PP  2A (6A3), demethylated\u2010  PP  2A (1D6), total   PP  2A (06\u2010222), and total B55  \u03b1   subunit (2G9).

Scale bar = 100   \u03bc  m. \n  \nIn frontal cortical tissue, the decline in methyl\u2010PP2A expression was significant only in DLB brains but not in PD brains (Fig.  A\u2013D). The immunoreactive signal of methyl\u2010PP2A was decreased by 31% in DLB (  P   < 0.05), but not significantly in PD (  P   = 0.18) compared to Controls. Demethylated PP2A, on the other hand, was increased in PD cortex by 147% (  P   < 0.01) and not in DLB (  P   = 0.34) (Fig.  E\u2013H). Similar trends were found with the ratios of methyl\u2010PP2A and demethyl\u2010PP2A to total PP2A (Fig.  D, H). As a result, the ratio of methyl\u2010PP2A over demethyl\u2010PP2A was significantly decreased in both PD (67%,   P   < 0.0001) and DLB cortices (57%,   P   < 0.0001) (Fig.  I). No changes were noted in total PP2A or total B55  \u03b1   in either disease condition compared to Controls. These findings suggest that there is proportionately less enzymatically active methylated PP2A relative to the inactive demethylated form in cortical tissue of both advanced PD and DLB. \n  \nImmunoreactivity patterns of methylated\u2010  PP  2A, demethylated\u2010  PP  2A, total   PP  2A, and total B55  \u03b1   subunit in the cortex of Parkinson disease (  PD  ), dementia with Lewy bodies (  DLB  ), and Control brains.

Since the main dephosphorylating enzyme of   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein is the B55  \u03b1   containing heterotrimeric isoform of PP2A,  and methylation of the C subunit of PP2A enhances the incorporation of the regulatory B55  \u03b1   subunit into the catalytically active holoenzyme, ,  ,   the markedly decreased expression of the methylating enzyme LCMT\u20101 in these conditions, and increased expression of the demethylating enzyme PME\u20101, lead to a striking decrease in the methylated form of PP2A. These dysregulatory changes are not only particularly prominent in the substantia nigra pars compacta but also present in the cortex. \n\nThe impact of these maladaptive changes in the brain is profound considering that PP2A is the master regulator of the cellular phospho\u2010regulatory network and plays key roles in regulating cytoskeletal integrity and signal transduction. ,  ,   Considering the deleterious consequences of a dysfunctional PP2A, it is unlikely that the changes observed in these postmortem brain analyses represent a protective effect in surviving neurons. In relation to   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies in particular, PP2A catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phospho\u2010Ser  \u03b1  \u2010synuclein, and the methylation state of the PP2A C subunit regulates this activity.  Accordingly, the finding of decreased PP2A methylation in this study provides a molecular mechanism for the reduced PP2A activity reported in   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies   and is likely a significant contributor to the hyperphosphorylation of aggregated   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein in these disorders. ,  \n\nThe striking association between decreased levels of PP2A methylation and decreased levels of LCMT\u20101 suggests that a primary regulatory locus for PP2A methylation is LCMT\u20101. In assessing the regulatory parameters that might control PP2A carboxyl methylation in the CNS, there has been a focus on factors that underlie methylation metabolism such as levels of the methyl donor, S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAM), the competitive inhibitor, S\u2010adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), or the methylation cycle intermediate homocysteine. Accordingly, there is considerable evidence that SAM and SAH levels play a substantial role in regulating PP2A. ,  ,  ,  ,   Conditions of methylation and one carbon stress have been shown to cause DNA hypomethylation at loci that appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. ,  ,   Similar epigenetic mechanisms may function directly or indirectly to reduce the expression of LCMT\u20101 and increase the expression of PME\u20101. This might provide a transcriptional mechanism to enforce the regulatory consequences of one\u2010carbon/methylation stress on PP2A activity, and at the same time, conserve methyl groups under conditions of methyl deficiency. In this regard, it is worth noting that L\u2010dopa therapy appears to exacerbate methylation deficiencies and results in hyperhomocysteinemia due to the action of catechol\u2010O\u2010methyl transferase (COMT). ,  \n\nConsiderable evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD   and DLB.  Evidence has also been reported that PP2A phosphatase activity is sensitive to oxidative stress,  and this sensitivity is proposed to be mediated by oxidation of a pair of vicinal cysteines located near the phosphatase active site of the C subunit.  Additionally, PP2A oxidation by exposure to micromolar levels of hydrogen peroxide has been shown to completely block its methylation by LCMT\u20101.  Furthermore, the X\u2010ray crystal structure of a complex between LCMT\u20101 and PP2A supports the notion that the formation of a disulfide crosslink between these cysteine residues might preclude formation of a productive LCMT\u20101\u2010PP2A complex and, thereby, block the methyltransferase activity of LCMT\u20101.  Thus, the oxidative stress environment in   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies may contribute to the decreased methylation of PP2A and its activity. \n\nBesides the mechanisms that can reduce PP2A methylation, several additional factors would be expected to contribute to the state of PP2A dysregulation in   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies. Pathologic   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein accumulation itself may be an inhibitor of PP2A activity resulting in a vicious cycle exacerbating the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of pathogenic proteins including   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein and tau in Lewy body disease. ,   Overexpression of   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein, particularly its A53T mutant which causes dominantly inherited PD and dementia, increases intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species in SH\u2010SY5Y neuroblastoma cells ,  contributing to oxidative stress\u2010mediated dysregulation of PP2A. ,   Accordingly, A53T\u2010mutant   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein reportedly reduces PP2A activity more than the wild\u2010type isoform does.  And in the rat striatum,   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein overexpression using viral vector\u2010mediated gene transfer results in decreased expression of PP2A B and C subunits as well as decreased PP2A activity. This effect is associated with increased   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation as well as neuronal cell death and inflammation.  Interestingly, parkin, which is linked to recessively inherited PD due to loss of function mutations, reportedly prevents   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein\u2010mediated reduction in PP2A expression and activity and mitigates the pathology induced by   \u03b1  \u2010synculein.  The negative impact of impaired PP2A activity is also exerted on parkin functioning as well contributing to neuronal dyshomeostasis. Inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid in cultured primary neurons reduces parkin expression level and K48\u2010linked polyubiquitination, which is implicated in parkin\u2010mediated mitophagy, suggesting that reduced PP2A activity impairs the machinery necessary for mitophagy leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. \n\nAnother mechanism through which   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein accumulation leads to impaired PP2A activity is through the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which has strong genetic link to PD and is decreased in sporadic PD brains. ,   In this regard, accumulation of oligomeric and phosphorylated   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein with age in the brains of cynomolgus monkeys is associated with decreased expression and activity of GCase, as well as reduced activity of PP2A particularly in brain regions that are susceptible to   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathy\u2010related neurodegeneration. This inverse association between GCase activity,   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation, and PP2A activity is also demonstrated in cultured neuronal cells, whereby inhibition of GCase activity leads to increased   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation and reduced methylated PP2A levels and activity. ,   Inhibition of autophagy due to loss of GCase function is also associated with inactivation of PP2A,  while activation of autophagy with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or metformin stimulates PP2A and reduces   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation in neuronal cells. ,  ,   GCase dysfunction may reduce PP2A activity through impaired lysosomal function and consequent   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein accumulation. In addition, GCase can also modulate PP2A directly through the product of its enzymatic activity, ceramide, which is an activator of PP2A  ,   and of autophagy.  Thus, a reduction in GCase activity decreases the production of ceramide leading to reduced PP2A activity. This may explain why accumulation of   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein in GCase mutants can be reversed by ceramide. \n\nThe present findings point to parallels in the dysregulation of PP2A, and in particular its methylation state, between   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies and Alzheimer's disease.  Decreased phosphatase activity toward abnormally phosphorylated tau had been recognized in AD brains.  Evidence for the mechanism of this decrease in phosphatase activity comes from the finding that LCMT\u20101 is decreased in AD brains, associated with decreased levels of methylated PP2A, and closely matching tau pathology.  In addition, levels of B  \u03b1   containing PP2A critical for regulating tau   are decreased in tangle\u2010bearing neurons correlating with increased tau pathology.  And the sensitivity to exogenously administered A  \u03b2   oligomers is reduced in the brains of transgenic animals overexpressing LCMT\u20101 and exacerbated in mice overexpressing PME\u20101.  In this study, although DLB cases have more advanced concomitant AD\u2010like pathology than PD cases (Table  ), the observation that indices of PP2A dysregulation in the cortex are not worse in DLB compared to PD suggests that   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathy is the primary driver of PP2A dysregulation in these two conditions. The finding that down\u2010regulation of LCMT\u20101 and changes in PP2A methylation are more prominent in the SN compared to the cortex in PD and DLB supports this notion and may be due to greater oxidative stress environment in the SN. Nevertheless, the contribution of concomitant AD pathology to these changes cannot be entirely excluded. Among the neurobiological consequences of altered LCMT\u20101 expression and PP2A methylation that relate to neurodegenerative diseases is neuritogenesis. Experimentally, in cultured neuroblastoma cells, enhanced expression of LCMT\u20101 increases methylated C and B  \u03b1   levels and promotes neuritogenesis.  These findings collectively suggest a global role of methylated PP2A in regulating brain protein homeostasis and neuronal survival in neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nThe above findings from postmortem brain analysis of PD and DLB patients suggest that efforts to enhance PP2A activity are a plausible therapeutic strategy in order to mitigate the neuropathology of   \u03b1  \u2010synucleinopathies. The ability of EHT, which prevents the demethylation of PP2A, in reducing   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation associated with improved neuropathological abnormalities and behavioral deficits in   \u03b1  \u2010synuclein transgenic mice   supports this conclusion. Enhancing PP2A activity has also been shown to mitigate the pathology in an AD model as well: EHT treatment resulted in substantial amelioration of AD\u2010like pathologies such as tau hyperphosphorylation, elevated amyloid\u2010  \u03b2   levels, and cognitive impairment in a rat model of AD generated by viral vector\u2010mediated expression of the PP2A endogenous inhibitor I2 , or SET protein, in the brain.  And in aged mice and in transgenic tauopathy models of AD, the use of another enhancer of PP2A activity, sodium selenite, has also been demonstrated to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation. ,   Thus, PP2A modulation may provide a common approach for treating neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with hyperphosphorylated pathogenic proteins. \n\n\n## Author contribution \n  \nExperiments were conceived by M.V., S.P.B., J.B.S., and M.M.M.

{"text": "Zhang, Y. N.\nParkinsons Dis, 2017\n\n# Title\n\nCan a Smartphone Diagnose Parkinson Disease? A Deep Neural Network Method and Telediagnosis System Implementation\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nParkinson's disease (PD) is primarily diagnosed by clinical examinations, such as walking test, handwriting test, and MRI diagnostic. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based PD telediagnosis method for smartphone. Classification of PD using speech records is a challenging task owing to the fact that the classification accuracy is still lower than doctor-level. Here we demonstrate automatic classification of PD using time frequency features, stacked autoencoders (SAE), and   K   nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. KNN classifier can produce promising classification results from useful representations which were learned by SAE. Empirical results show that the proposed method achieves better performance with all tested cases across classification tasks, demonstrating machine learning capable of classifying PD with a level of competence comparable to doctor. It concludes that a smartphone can therefore potentially provide low-cost PD diagnostic care. This paper also gives an implementation on browser/server system and reports the running time cost. Both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed telediagnosis system are discussed.  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a disorder of brain nervous system which can cause partial or full loss in movement, behavior, and mental processing, especially speech function [ ]. Generally, PD can be observed in elderly people and causes disorders in speech [ ]. At present, about 1% of the worldwide population over the age of fifty is suffering from PD [ ]. Until now, many effective methods and medicines [ \u2013 ] are invented for relieving the symptoms of PD. Therefore, an early-diagnosis in time and available treatment can improve the prognosis of PD [ ]. However, many patients diagnosed with PD are later found which resulted in delays in patient condition [ ]. Moreover, many patients with Parkinson's disease in the community still remain undiagnosed and more patients get worse because of poor medical conditions in low income areas [ ]. \n\nEven though many clinical examinations and diagnostic to PD have been proposed [ \u2013 ], it is important that we should exert more effort in automated diagnosis and telediagnosis [ ] in real world. In the research of Esteva et al. [ ], they deduced that billions of smartphones have the potential to provide medical care for skin cancer diagnosis. Inspired by this novel idea, a smartphone also has the potential to diagnose PD. Many clinical reports reveal that the dysphonic indicator is an important reference index in diagnosis [ ]. Therefore, our method is based on the study of vocal impairment symptoms (dysphonia) (90% of people with PD have such symptom) [ ]. \n\nThe purpose of this research is to design a machine learning based telediagnosis PD system for patients by using a smartphone. We found that deep neural network [ ] with   K   nearest neighbor (KNN) [ ] method can achieve better performance on available speech datasets than other comparative methods. Not only is the proposed telediagnosis system compared with other researchers' methods, but also the running time cost is tested in browser/server system. To conclude, the contribution of this paper includes (1) achieving high performance and (2) proposing a feasible implementation with empirical test. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows: in  , background and related works are presented. In  , the proposed method and telediagnosis system are described.   shows the experimental results. Conclusions are drawn in  . \n\n\n## 2. Background and Related Works \n  \n### 2.1. Parkinson's Disease and Speech Disorders \n  \nMany researchers have exerted much effort on PD in their researches. In 2006, Rao et al. [ ] discussed diagnosis and treatment for PD. The author insisted that psychosis is usually drug induced; further it can be managed initially by reducing antiparkinsonian medications. Jankovic and Aguilar [ ] reviewed approaches to the treatment of PD and the authors think that the new treatments are not necessarily better than the established conventional therapy and that the treatment options must be individualized and tailored to the needs of each individual patient. In 2010, Varanese et al. [ ] showed treatment of advanced PD, and the research paper concluded that supportive care, including physical and rehabilitative interventions, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and nursing care, has a key role in the late stage of disease. Yitayeh and Teshome [ ] reviewed the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment on balance dysfunction and postural instability in persons with Parkinson's disease and the author also presented meta-analysis results, in 2016. \n\nSo far, it has been reported that of the 89% of PD patients with voice and speech disorders [ ,  ], the reduced speech ability to communicate is considered to be one of the most important aspects of PD by many patients [ ]. The common perceptual features of reduced loudness (hypophonia), reduced pitch variation (monotone), breathy and hoarse voice quality, and imprecise articulation [ ], together with lessened facial expression (masked faces), contribute to limitations in communication in the majority of people with PD [ ]. \n\n shows the comparison of waveforms between people with PD and healthy people. Intuitively, it can be observed that the waveform of healthy people is smooth and continuous, but the waveform of people with PD contains unexpected vibrations. The reason for this phenomenon is that the people with PD lose the ability of precise muscle control [ \u2013 ]. The vibrations can be detected by time frequency analysis; moreover machine learning based audio analysis methods are appropriate for diagnosing PD. \n\n\n### 2.2. Machine Learning for Parkinson's Disease Diagnostic Care \n  \nMany researchers had proposed effective methods based on machine learning in automated diagnosis research. In 2014, Shahbakhi et al. [ ] proposed a method using genetic algorithm and support vector machine for analysis of speech for diagnosis of PD. Little et al. [ ] used support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian radical basis kernel to diagnose PD. Shahbaba and Neal [ ] showed a nonlinear model for the PD classification which is based on Dirichlet mixtures. Sakar and Kursun [ ] applied mutual information measure to combine with SVM. Those methods achieve high classification accuracy but telediagnosis PD needs a better method with higher classification performance. \n\nRecently, deep neural networks have shown potentials in speech recognition tasks; the classification and recognition accuracy is superior to conventional machine learning method. We proposed a method using deep neural network (stacked autoencoders, SAE) to reduce dimensions and   K   nearest neighbor classifier to diagnose PD. We also implemented a telediagnosis system based on the proposed method. Results of empirical test on smartphone are presented in  . \n\n\n\n## 3. Methodology \n  \n### 3.1. Structure of PD Telediagnosis Method and System Structure \n  \nThe proposed structure of the PD telediagnosis method is as shown in  . A patient provides personal information and speech records by following instructions of smartphone. The personal information includes gender, age, and a brief health history. Patient is also asked to read a given text; then the speech records of the patient are parsed to be time frequency based features which are extracted from the voice samples. After the processing of SAE and KNN, patient can receive the diagnosis result. \n\n shows the workflow of the proposed method in the view of machine learning, an appropriate set of time frequency features, SAE, and classifier dictated diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, the most important work is how to build a high accuracy diagnostic method. \n\n briefly illustrates the architecture of the proposed method on B/S (browser/server) structure and details are shown in  . The server should be installed on an operation system. In next step, an appropriate version of web service software should be deployed on this server. Usually a smartphone embedded Internet browser software (such as Google Chrome App). Therefore the smartphone can send/receive data (text and voice records) to server by Internet browser. The connection between smartphone and server can be 2/3/4G mobile network or WIFI. The server receives and processes audio files as Figures   and   present. Result of PD diagnosis will be displayed on patient's smartphone. This B/S structure is not limited to smartphone, but it is suitable for other electronic devices too, such as iPad, notebook, and even a smart watch. Moreover, the automated voice service system (such as banks' telephone services) should fulfill the same task as B/S structure theoretically. \n\n\n### 3.2. Speech Features \n  \nDysphonia [ ] is a typical speech problem of people with PD. Dysphonia is a human vocal problem which includes five major clinical features: loudness, decrease, breathiness, roughness, and exaggerated vocal tremor in voice. All those indications can be detected by analyzing time frequency in speech records. A set of 26 features is listed with the considering of the previous works held on this field of study [ ,  ]. \n\nIn  , 6 types of parameters are listed; they are frequency parameters, pulse parameters, amplitude parameters, voicing parameters, pitch parameters, and harmonicity parameters. 26 features are also presented in  . \n\n\n### 3.3. Stacked Autoencoders \n  \nAutoencoder [ ] has been wildly used in unsupervised feature learning and speech recognition tasks. It can be built as a special three-layer neural network: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the reconstruction layer (as shown in  ). \n\nAn autoencoder has two parts: (1) The encoder receives an input   x   \u2208   R   to the hidden layer (latent representation feature)   x   \u2208   R   via a mapping   f  : where   s   is the activation function, whose input is called the activation of the hidden layer, and {  W  ,   b  } is the parameter set with a weight matrix   W   \u2208   R   and a bias value vector   b   \u2208   R  . \n\n(2) The decoder maps the hidden representation   x   back to reconstruction   x   \u2208   R   via mapping function   f  : \n\n s   is the activation function of the decoder with parameters {  W  ,   b  },   W   \u2208   R  ,   b   \u2208   R  . The input of   s   is defined as the activation of the reconstruction layer. Parameters are learned through backpropagation by minimizing the loss   L  (  x  ,   x  ):  \n\nIn ( ),   L  (  x  ,   x  ) consists of the reconstruction error   L   and the   L   regularization of   W   and   W  . By minimizing the reconstruction error   L  , the hidden feature should be able to reconstruct the original input   x   as much as possible. \n\nThe stacked autoencoders (SAE) [ ] are multiple layers of autoencoders. They are a deep learning approach for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. As   shows, there are n autoencoders which are trained one by one. The input vectors are fed to the first autoencoder. After finishing training the first autoencoder, the output hidden representation is propagated to the second auto layer. A typical activation function is sigmoid function which is used for activation functions   s   and   s  . After this pretraining stage, the whole SAE is fine-tuned [ ] based on a predefined objective. The last hidden layer of the SAE encoder can further cooperate with other applications, such as SVM for classification task. \n\n\n### 3.4. KNN Classifier \n  \nThe KNN [ ] classifier is quite simple: given a speech record of undiagnosed patient   s  , the system finds the   K   nearest neighbors to give diagnosis result. Formally, the decision rule can be written as  \n\nAbove, KNN(  S  ) indicates the set of   K   nearest neighbors of speech records   S  .   \u03b4  (  S  ,   c  ) is the classification for undiagnosed patient   s   with respect to class   c  , and  \n\nFor undiagnosed patient, the patient could be given diagnosis result.   K   of KNN is 1 in this paper. \n\n\n\n## 4. Experimental Results \n  \n### 4.1. Speech Datasets, Evaluation Criteria, and Classifiers \n  \nFor comparison, we chose two research papers [ ,  ] and the PD speech datasets they had used. We use Matlab as programming tool and all classification algorithms are determined by grid search method. \n\nIn the first paper, Sakar et al. [ ] collected a speech dataset of diagnosis of PD and donated this speech dataset to UCI machine learning group for other researchers. This speech dataset contains a training set file, a testing set file, and a ZIP package of WMA files. Betul Erdogdu Sakar et al. designed a novel speech test; PD patients were asked to say only the sustained vowels \u201ca\u201d and \u201co\u201d three times. Their work of speech dataset collection was finished at Istanbul University and we call the dataset \u201cIstanbul Dataset\u201d in the following experiments. \n\nIn the second paper, Ma et al. [ ] proposed a kernel extreme learning machine with subtractive clustering features weighting approach. Their method compared with 15 researches' methods. Total 16 methods are compared in their research paper, and the method of Ma et al. gained top position. The dataset of their research was created by Little et al. [ ] of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. We call the dataset \u201cOxford Dataset\u201d in the following experiments. \n\nAccuracy, sensitivity, and other performance indexes are compared among those classifiers and these performance indexes are defined as follows:   \nSensitivity: \n  \nSpecificity: \n  \n F  -score: \n  \nMCC: \n  where TP, FP, TN, and FN are the true and false positive and true and false negative classifications of a classifier and they are defined as shown in  . \n\nInvolved classifiers are kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), Multilayer perceptrons Support Vector Machine (MSVM), Radial basis function Support Vector Machine (RSVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), KNN, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayesian (NB) method. \n\n\n### 4.2. Experiment Results: Oxford Dataset and Algorithm Parameters \n  \nThe Oxford Dataset [ ,  ] consisted of voice measurements from 31 people and 23 of them were diagnosed with PD. There are total 195 samples comparing 147 PD and 48 healthy samples in the dataset. There are no missing values in the Oxford Dataset and each feature is real type value. The whole 22 features are contained in  . \n\nThe SAE of the proposed method has two hidden layer: layer 1 and layer 2. The size of layer 1 is set as 10, 9, or 8 neurons and the size of layer 2 is set as 8, 7, or 6 neurons. The batch size of SAE is 20 in training and fine tuning step. All comparative classifiers are optimized by grid search method. We use 50-50% training-testing method as Polat [ ] and Daliri [ ] did. This experiment method tests comparative approaches with much less training data than 10-fold cross validation. Each classifier was tested 10 times and the results are presented in tables. \n\n#### 4.2.1. Classifiers without Deep Neural Network on Oxford Dataset \n  \n summarized the detailed results of classification accuracy after 10 runs. From this table, it can be found that the classification performance of KNN is apparently differential. We can see that the KNN outperforms that with other 7 classifiers with a max, mean, and min accuracy of 90.53%, 82.76%, and 76.84%. All comparative classifiers give low classification results because the input samples are 22-dimensional data. \n\n\n#### 4.2.2. Classifiers with Deep Neural Network on Oxford Dataset \n  \nTables   and   presented the comparison result of the classification accuracy and other performance indexes.   lists details of accuracy. For SAE, the influence of two layers in dimension reduction has been investigated. In this study, two hidden layers are tested as a subgrid search. As seen from  , 1NN classifier gives more correct diagnosis results than other methods. \n\nComparing Tables   and  , other 7 classifiers gave more correct classification result with the using of SAE (hidden layer 1 contains 9 neurons; hidden layer 2 contains 7 neutrons). KELM has obtained max classification accuracy as 98.81%; it is 16% higher than 82.23% in  . LSVM gives 96.71% classification accuracy after dimensional reduction by SAE 8-7. In SAE 10-7 row, MSVM increased 11% in terms of classification accuracy. RSVM gives 97.75% classification accuracy in the row of SAE 9-7. Similarly, CART produced average classification accuracy as 96% when applying SAE. LDA and NB also have got better performance than without using SAE; the classification accuracy of those 7 classifiers are improved by 10\u201315% with the using of SAE. \n\n\n\n### 4.3. Experiment Results: Istanbul Dataset and Parameters Settings \n  \nThe Istanbul University built a PD database. This database consists of training and test files. The training data belongs to 20 people with PD (6 females, 14 males) and 20 healthy individuals (10 females, 10 males) who participate in the PD database project at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, multiple types of sound recordings (26 voice samples including sustained vowels, numbers, words, and short sentences) are taken. A group of 26 linear and time frequency based features are extracted from each voice sample. Those features are presented in  , as   shows. \n\n28 PD patients are asked to say only the sustained vowels \u201ca\u201d and \u201co\u201d three times, respectively, which makes a total of 168 recordings. The same 26 features are extracted from voice samples of this dataset. The researchers of the Istanbul University declared that [ ] the PD dataset can be used as an independent test set to validate the results obtained on training set. The training file contains 1040 recordings and the testing file contains 168 files. Therefore, we used the training file and testing file to compare the proposed method with other methods. \n\nThe SAE of the proposed method has two hidden layer: layer 1 and layer 2. Layer 1 is set as 10, 9, or 8 neurons and layer 2 is set as 8, 7, or 6 neurons. The batch size of SAE is 20 in training and fine tuning step. \n\n#### 4.3.1. Classifiers without Deep Neural Network on Istanbul Dataset \n  \n summarized the results of classification accuracy. According to the declaration of Istanbul University, fixed training set and testing set are given. Only one run will obtain final result. From this table, it can be found that the classification performance of RSVM is apparently differential. We can see that the RSVM outperforms that with other 7 classifiers with a classification accuracy of 76.41%. All comparative classifiers give low classification results because the input samples are 26-dimensional data. The Naive Bayesian method gives worst result among all classifiers. \n\n\n#### 4.3.2. Classifiers with Deep Neural Network on Istanbul Dataset \n  \nTables   and   presented the comparison result of the classification accuracy and other 4 performance indexes.   lists details of classification accuracy. To SAE, two hidden layers are set as Oxford Dataset experiment. As seen from  , KNN classifier gives more correct diagnosis results than other methods. The max, mean, and min classification accuracy of KNN classifier are not affected by network structure of SAE. \n\nComparing Tables   and  , the other 7 classifiers gave more correct classification result with the using of SAE. And LSVM, RSVM, and CART show much more stability in classification accuracy. But KELM still did not obtain 100.00% classification accuracy,  . LSVM gives 92.00% classification accuracy after dimensional reduction by SAE 9-7. In SAE 10-7, SAE10-6, and SAE 9-6 row, LSVM did not give perfect performance. MSVM, LDA, and NB increased classification accuracy but still lack stability. In conclusion, every classifier has got better performance than without using SAE. \n\n\n\n### 4.4. Implementation on B/S System \n  \nAs   shows, our smartphone is running Android system and it was installed from Google Chrome web browser. The server installed Windows operation system and Internet Information Services. We also installed Matlab 2016a and Visual Studio 2013 on this server. Programming techniques contain Matlab, C#, and HTML5. \n\nWe used Chrome to connect server via 4G mobile network in the street; we send 28 test speech records (WMA files) of Istanbul Dataset; a transmission of 12.1\u2009MB data took less than 5 seconds to our laboratory. The server received speech records and ran the empirical experiments as Sections   and   present. No more than 2 minutes, results of all comparative classifiers were displayed on our smartphone. We also recorded our speech (as healthy samples) and send it to server for testing, but it should be noticed that a quite environment is necessary. It is hard to achieve satisfied classification accuracy in a noisy circumstance. \n\n\n### 4.5. Discussions and Future Work \n  \n summarized the comparative results achieved from related researches. It can be seen that the proposed method achieves better results than other methods and our method shows a relatively fewer training samples. The reduced training dataset is meaningful when applying the proposed method in reality. The performance of SAE and KNN is robust to number of hidden neutrons of deep neural network. \n\nWe focus on classification accuracy, sensitivity, and other performance indexes to evaluate machine learning based PD diagnosis method; then we choose a B/S structure to test the proposed architecture. Advantages contain time saving, being convenient, and low cost. But we did not achieve 100% correct classification accuracy on smartphone. We deduced that there are still potential problems: (1) a good enough microphone should be taken into consideration. (2) Speech denoising may be fulfilled by multiple microphones. (3) An evolutionary system can overcome big testing data in real world. The future investigation will pay much attention on an evolutionary telediagnosis PD system and solve above issues. Moreover, we also noticed that two public datasets cannot guarantee that a machine learning based telediagnosis system can be trained very well and it is hard to satisfy hospitals, clinics, and other medical institutions. And the stability and robustness of a telediagnosis system still need to be built urgently. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nFor building a convenient and feasible telediagnosis PD service via smartphone, we proposed a machine learning based method on browser/server architecture. In this paper, the proposed method contains stacked autoencoders and KNN classifier which is used to process speech records. The proposed method can remap time frequency features in low dimensional space. Results show that the proposed method with KNN classifier can give doctor-level classification results on public PD speech records. An experimental system is also built for testing; it is projected that telediagnosis of PD on a smartphone will be in the future. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5624169, "text_md5": "3baed308a5879a885a76b3353922eb2c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 12], "journal": [13, 27], "publication_year": [29, 33], "title": [44, 157], "keywords": [171, 171], "abstract": [184, 1346], "body": [1355, 23308]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29075547, "doi": "10.1155/2017/6209703", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5624169", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5624169"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5624169\">5624169</a>", "list_title": "PMC5624169  Can a Smartphone Diagnose Parkinson Disease?

We evaluated myocardial tissue characteristics at the preexcited segment in adult WPW syndrome patients and their implicated findings. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFor this prospective study, we enrolled 22 adult WPW syndrome patients (16 male, mean 45.4 \u00b1 17.8 years) with echocardiographic findings of regional wall motion abnormality in our electrophysiology clinic. Of these patients, 14 underwent radiofrequency ablation before cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging including cine and late gadolinium enhancement. The ventricular morphology, function and myocardial characteristics of the preexcited segment were analyzed. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA relatively high prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement (9/22, 40.9%) was observed exclusively at the basal septum. The septal accessory pathway was significantly more prevalent in patients with late gadolinium enhancement (  P   = 0.011). The prevalences of regional myocardial wall thinning and regional akinesia were significantly higher (  P   = 0.001 for both) and left ventricular function was significantly decreased in patients with late gadolinium enhancement (  P   < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant relationships between radiofrequency ablation and regional akinesia (  P   > 0.999), regional myocardial wall thinning (  P   > 0.999), late gadolinium enhancement (  P   = 0.662) and low ejection fraction (  P   > 0.999). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nMyocardial fibrosis was observed at the preexcited myocardium of adult WPW syndrome patients with septal accessory pathway, which could accompany regional akinesia and regional myocardial wall thinning and might be related to persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction even after radiofrequency ablation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) syndrome is defined as a congenital condition involving an abnormal conductive accessory pathway between the atrium and ventricle that bypasses the atrioventricular node [ , ]. This syndrome is of clinical importance because it is frequently associated with supraventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, sudden cardiac death is potentially possible due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia from the associated atrial fibrillation with rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway [ , ]. In addition, a rare cause of morbidity in WPW syndrome patients is heart failure, which may occur as a result of recurrent or sustained tachyarrhythmia [ ]. Recently, several literatures have reported a possible direct association between WPW syndrome and heart failure, regardless of the related tachyarrhythmia [ \u2013 ]. Eccentric ventricular preexcitation through the accessory pathway results in premature contraction of that ventricle, and this has been well documented in echocardiography [ , ]. Regional premature contractions are thought to be a possible mechanism for heart failure in WPW syndrome by inducing progressive ventricular dilatation with cardiac dysfunction similar to functional aneurysm [ , ]. In addition, heart failure in WPW syndrome has been associated with the septal accessory pathway and has a reversible nature with a temporal relation after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the septal accessory pathway [ , , , ]. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a rapidly evolving technology that might now be the most powerful imaging tool for noninvasive myocardial characterization through the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping technique. Recent research has supported the value of these techniques for the assessment of myocardial characteristics under multiple conditions [ , ]. We thought that the preexcited segment in WPW syndrome could have different myocardial characteristics from the normal myocardium, especially in adult patients who are exposed to the accessory pathway for a long period of time, and we thought that the different characteristics could be related to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, as far as we know, CMR findings for myocardial characterization in WPW syndrome patients have rarely been studied. Therefore, we evaluated the myocardial characteristics of the preexcited segment using CMR in adult WPW syndrome patients and their implicated findings through this study. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study population \n  \nThis prospective study was approved by our institutional review board and the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. A cardiologist and a radiologist reviewed the electrical medical record database and searched for new adult WPW syndrome patients (age \u2265 20 years) who had undergone echocardiography at their first examination in our electrophysiology (EP) clinics between January 2010 and December 2014, and 327 patients were identified. Of them, 77 patients (23.5%, 77/327) who had abnormal echocardiographic findings of regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA), which did not correspond with vascular territory and was noted at the expected preexcited segment, were selected. A flow diagram for the study population and exclusion criteria is summarized in  . After the exclusion criteria were applied, 22 patients (16 males with a mean age of 45.4 \u00b1 17.8 years) were finally enrolled. All 22 patients underwent CMR prospectively from January 2014 to May 2015. \n   Flow chart for the study population.  \nCMR = cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; RWMA = regional wall motion abnormality. \n  \n\n### Clinical characteristics \n  \nAll available clinical data were recorded after reviewing electronic medical records and/or after interviewing each patient with a standard questionnaire. Clinical presentation in terms of palpitation, chest pain and syncope was reviewed. The 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) during sinus rhythm at the time of diagnosis was reviewed. On ECG, we reconfirmed ventricular preexcitation by Kent fibers with a short PR interval, widened QRS complex with slurred upstroke and secondary repolarization changes. An automatic computerized system recorded the longest QRS duration exhibited by the leads and the accessory pathway location was determined [ ]. All study records from patients who underwent an EP study with RFA were reviewed for accessory pathways and related tachyarrhythmia. Data on performance of RFA and the approach method chosen for the ablation of the accessory pathway were also recorded. The accessory pathway locations were determined again in the EP study. From the results of the ECG and EP study, accessory pathway locations were categorized into one of the following three groups: septal (anteroseptal, midseptal and posteroseptal), right (right anterior, right lateral and right posterior), or left (left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterior) [ ]. In addition, the presence of significant coronary artery disease was evaluated based on coronary artery computed tomography or conventional coronary angiography records obtained within 3 years before CMR. \n\n\n### CMR protocol \n  \nCMR was performed with a 3.0-T imaging system (Magnetom Trio; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) and an 8-channel cardiac coil. After a localized scan, ECG-gated cardiac cine images were obtained with the following parameters: True fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequence, TR 3.31 ms, TE 1.44 ms, flip angle 50\u00b0, field of view 337 x 400 mm, matrix 216 x 216, 25 phases and slice thickness 8 mm without gap in the four-chamber, long-axis and short-axis planes encompassing the whole ventricles. LGE imaging was performed 10 minutes after injection of gadobutrol (0.2 mmol/kg, Gadovist; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at 2 ml/sec. Scanning parameters were as follows: segmented inversion recovery prepared turbo fast low-angle shot sequence, TR 9.9 ms, TE 4.9 ms, flip angle 20\u00b0, field of view 380 x 380 mm, matrix 320 x 320 and slice thickness 8 mm without gap in the four-chamber, long-axis and short-axis planes encompassing the whole ventricles. Data acquisition was synchronized with ECG in the mid-diastolic phase. An 11-heartbeat modified Look-Locker sequence with inversion recovery was used for T1 measurement of the myocardium [ ]. Scanning parameters were as follows: TR/TE = 2.43/1.01 ms, minimum inversion time 100 msec with inversion time increment 80 ms, field of view 308 x 380 mm , acquisition matrix 126 x 192, flip angle 35\u00b0, and slice thickness 8 mm. Short-axis images were acquired at the apical, mid and basal levels of the left ventricle. Images for T1 measurements were obtained before and 15 minutes after contrast administration. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nAll CMR images were transferred to dedicated software (CMR 42; Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Two observers (H.J.L and Y.J.K. with 9 and 12 years of experience in cardiac imaging, respectively) who were both blinded to each patient\u2019s clinical findings reviewed the images in consensus. From the cine images, observers evaluated the presence of regional myocardial wall thinning, which was defined as a myocardial wall thickness of 5.5mm or less on the end-diastolic image [ ]. To evaluate myocardial mechanics, a semi-automated feature tracking method was used to obtain information on the ventricular strains: radial, circumferential and longitudinal strains. Using the results for global strain, strain rate, and time to peak, observers determined the presence of RWMAs ( ) [ ]. Afterwards, both ventricular end-diastolic volumes with ejection fractions were calculated by semi-automatically tracing the endocardial contours at end-systole and end-diastole in each short-axis image from the apical to basal ventricle. Patients were regarded as having low ejection fraction if the left ventricular ejection fraction was < 50%. Myocardial LGE was defined as a region with an apparent high signal intensity of > 5 standard deviations of the remote normal myocardium. If LGE was detected, its pattern was further classified and the location was recorded. Myocardial extracellular volume fraction was measured using pre- and post-contrast T1 map images with the following equation: Extracellular volume fraction (%) = (\u0394R1 /\u0394R1 ) x (1 \u2013hematocrit) x 100, for which R1  is R1 in the myocardium, R1  is R1 in the blood, and \u0394R1 is the change in relaxivity before and after gadolinium chelate administration, respectively [ ]. \n   Strain curves for the regional wall motion abnormalities.  \nRepresentative longitudinal strain curves are shown with the blue curve representing a normal contraction, the red a premature contraction, and the green hypokinesia or akinesia. Regional premature contraction was defined with the early systolic peak during the systole with decreased time to peak (red solid arrow) and overall decreased absolute values of global strains compared to the normal curve. An additional systolic peak (second or third) (red open arrows) could also indicate premature contraction. Regional hypokinesia or akinesia was defined with decreased absolute values of global strains and mild increased time to peak. \n  \n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using statistical software (SPSS version 23.0 for Windows, SPSS). Continuous variables were expressed as mean values with standard deviations and categorical variables were expressed as percentages. We divided the patients into two groups according to the presence of LGE, and compared clinical characteristic and other CMR findings between the two groups. Additional analyses were done in which the study population was divided into two groups according to the performance of RFA or the presence of RWMA. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to appraise the differences between the two groups for continuous variables and the chi-square contingency tables or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to evaluate the differences between the two groups for categorical variables. A   P   value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical characteristics \n  \nThe clinical characteristics of the study population are summarized in  . The mean age of the patients was 43.6 \u00b1 17.2 years at first diagnosis. All patients underwent ECG at the time of diagnosis and had ventricular preexcitation caused by Kent fibers on ECG. Palpitations were present in all patients. Of the patients with palpitations, chest pain was additionally documented in 6 patients and syncope in 4 patients. Fourteen patients of the study population underwent an EP study with RFA due to documented supraventricular tachyarrhythmias prior to CMR. The median time interval from first diagnosis to RFA for the 14 patients was 65.5 (IQR, 54.8\u201387.5) days. Accessory pathways were classified based on mainly ECG findings because not all patients underwent an EP study. For the 14 patients who underwent an EP study, both the ECG and EP study classified the accessory pathways identically. There was no patient with multiple accessory pathways. No recurrence was observed in patients with RFA. In addition, we observed no significant coronary artery disease in 16 patients on coronary computed tomographic angiography or conventional coronary angiography. The other 6 patients did not undergo coronary evaluation. \n   Comparison of clinical characteristics according to the presence of LGE.        \n\n### CMR findings \n  \nMedian time interval from first diagnosis to CMR was 499.5 (IQR, 352.8\u2013754.0) days. Median time interval from RFA to CMR was 465.5 (IQR, 276.5\u2013709.5) days for the 14 patients with RFA. The CMR findings from the study population are summarized in  . On CMR, RWMA was noted at the preexcited segment in 13 patients (13/22, 59.1%) and all of these findings were observed at the basal septum. Regional premature contractions were noted in 6 patients with a septal accessory pathway and 1 patient with a right posterior accessory pathway close to the inferior septum. Regional akinesia instead of premature contraction was noted in 6 patients with a septal accessory pathway. On the cine images, regional myocardial wall thinning was noted at the basal septum in 6 patients with a septal accessory pathway (6/22, 27.3%). The mean values of the end-diastolic volume were 90.8 \u00b1 30.9 ml/BSA and 78.8 \u00b1 15.8 ml/BSA, and ejection fractions were 56.7 \u00b1 12.0% and 58.0 \u00b1 5.8% for the left and right ventricles, respectively. From the functional results, 7 patients (7/22, 31.8%) were classified as having low ejection fraction with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction of < 50%. LGE at the preexcited segment was present in 8 patients with a septal accessory pathway and 1 patient with a right accessory pathway (9/22, 40.9%). All demonstrated LGEs were detected at the basal septum (both the anterior and inferior septum in 5 patients and only the inferior septum in 4 patients). The patterns of LGE were as follows: ill-defined patchy LGE in 4 patients and linear endocardial and/or epicardial LGE not corresponding with vascular territory in 5 patients. All of the 6 patients who did not undergo coronary evaluation did not show LGE on CMR. The native T1 value of the myocardium was measured as 1253.9 \u00b1 41.6 msec and myocardial extracellular volume fraction was measured as 27.2 \u00b1 1.8%. \n   Comparison of CMR findings according to the presence of LGE.        \n\n### Differences in clinical and other CMR findings according to the presence of LGE \n  \nAmong clinical findings, the QRS duration was significantly longer in patients with LGE compared to patients without LGE (  P   = 0.021). The prevalence of septal accessory pathway was significantly higher in patients with LGE compared to patients without LGE (  P   = 0.011). In addition, the prevalence of lateral accessory pathway was significantly lower in patients with LGE compared to patients without LGE (  P   = 0.046). Other findings did not show significant differences between the two groups. Among CMR findings, a significantly higher prevalence of regional myocardial wall thinning was observed in patients with LGE (  P   = 0.001). The prevalence of akinesia was also significantly different between the two groups (  P   = 0.001) with akinesia being more prevalent in patients with LGE. However, for premature contractions, there was no significant difference between the two groups (  P   > 0.999). The mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly larger (  P   = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly decreased (  P   < 0.001) in patients with LGE. Likewise, the prevalence of low ejection fraction was significantly higher in patients with LGE (7/9, 77.8%) than patients without LGE (0/13, 0.0%) (  P   < 0.001). In addition, patients with LGE showed significantly decreased right ventricular ejection fraction compared to patients without LGE (  P   = 0.001). The mean values of myocardial native T1 and extracellular volume fraction were significantly higher in patients with LGE compared to patients without LGE (  P   < 0.001 and 0.006, respectively), especially at the septum (  P   < 0.001 for both), but not for the lateral wall of the left ventricle (  P   = 0.284 and 0.793, respectively). \n\n\n### Comparison of major findings according to performance of RFA \n  \nThe major findings were compared according to performance of RFA and the results are summarized in  . Among the 14 patients who underwent RFA before CMR, 9 patients showed no RWMA but 5 patients still had RWMA on CMR even after successful RFA. The prevalence of regional premature contractions was significantly lower in patients who underwent RFA (  P   = 0.002). However, we observed no significant differences in the prevalences of regional akinesia and regional myocardial wall thinning between the two groups (  P   > 0.999 for both). In addition, there were no significant differences in the prevalences of LGE and low ejection fraction between the two groups (  P   = 0.662 and > 0.999, respectively). \n   Comparison of major findings according to performance of RFA.        \n\n### Relationships between major findings with a set diagram \n  \nA set diagram was drawn to describe logical relations between the major findings ( ). All 9 patients without RWMA received RFA before CMR and did not show low ejection fraction as well as LGE. Among the 13 patients with RWMA at the preexcited segment, 7 patients showed low ejection fraction and all these patients had LGE. Of the 7 patients with low ejection fraction, 1 patient had regional premature contractions and 6 patients had regional akinesia with myocardial wall thinning ( ). Of the 6 patients without low ejection fraction from regional premature contractions, 2 patients showed LGE and 4 patients did not. All patients with regional akinesia had a septal accessory pathway; 4 patients underwent RFA and 2 patients did not. In addition, we observed that the prevalence of the septal accessory pathway (92.3%,12/13) was significantly higher in patients with RWMA compared to patients without RWMA (22.2%, 2/9) (  P   < 0.001) from the diagram. The prevalence of LGE in patients with RWMA (69.2%, 9/13) was also significantly higher than in patients without RWMA (0.0%, 0/9) (P < 0.001). \n   Set diagram for the logical relations between the major findings.  \nRed circles indicate patients with septal accessory pathways, green circles indicate right accessory pathways and blue circles indicate left accessory pathways. Patterns within the circles indicate patients who did not undergo radiofrequency ablation. EF = ejection fraction; LGE = late gadolinium enhancement; RWMA = regional wall motion abnormality. \n     A 67-year-old female patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.  \nShe underwent an electrophysiologic study due to frequent palpitations. Radiofrequency ablation was applied to the posteroseptal accessory pathway through the transseptal approach (asterisk) (A). One year later, the patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Four-chamber and short-axis cine images show regional myocardial wall thinning (about 5.1mm) at the basal inferior septum on the end-diastolic phase (arrows) (B, C). Decreased global longitudinal strain is noted at the basal septum with the feature tracking method, which suggests regional akinesia (D). The left ventricular ejection fraction is 47.6%. Linear endocardial and epicardial late gadolinium enhancements not corresponding with the vascular territory are noted on the four-chamber and short-axis late gadolinium enhancement images (open arrows) (E, F). \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe evaluated myocardial characteristics of the preexcited myocardium using CMR in adult patients with WPW syndrome. In our results, we observed a relatively high prevalence of LGE in the study participants (9/22, 40.9%) exclusively at the basal septum. The prevalence of septal accessory pathway was significantly higher in patients with LGE. In addition, the prevalences of regional myocardial wall thinning and regional akinesia were significantly higher in patients with LGE. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly larger and both ventricular ejection fractions were significantly decreased in patients with LGE. The native T1 value and extracellular volume fraction were significantly increased in patients with LGE, especially at the septum, which might support the presence of myocardial fibrosis. In addition, there were no significant relationships between RFA and abnormal CMR findings such as regional akinesia, regional myocardial wall thinning, LGE and low ejection fraction in the present study. \n\nAlthough we included patients with RWMA observed on echocardiography, only 13 patients (13/22, 59.1%) had RWMA on CMR. This is probably because the patients without RWMA on CMR underwent RFA before undergoing CMR. As ventricular preexcitation in the manifest WPW syndrome occurs at the myocardium close to the ventricular insertion of the accessory pathway, we thought that abnormal findings in the myocardium on CMR might be exclusively observed at the basal left ventricle [ ]. In addition, all these abnormal findings were observed at the preexcited segment in patients with a septal accessory pathway, namely the basal septum, with the exception of 1 patient with a right posterior accessory pathway who had a preexcited segment close to the inferior septum. Hypothetically, this finding might be related to the relatively shorter conduction time between the sinus node and septal accessory pathway [ , , ], which might have more effects on the myocardium compared to the right or left accessory pathways. \n\nRecently published literatures have reported that non-physiologic activation through the accessory pathway can directly lead to heart failure [ \u2013 , , , ]. According to this hypothesis, abnormally decreased local preload by premature contractions can decrease the workload of the preexcited myocardium, which might induce regional myocardial wall thinning [ \u2013 ]. Regional myocardial wall thinning could then induce the systolic bulging of the corresponding segment, which in turn progresses to heart failure. Likewise, these findings were exclusively observed at the basal septum in patients with a septal accessory pathway. Previous research has also reported that regional myocardial wall thinning and/or heart failure in WPW syndrome are reversible and that cardiac function can be restored after RFA. However, in the present study, we observed 9 patients (9/22, 40.9%) with LGE at the basal septum, which could suggest myocardial fibrosis. Also, regional myocardial wall thinning, regional akinesia and low ejection fraction were only present in patients with LGE. In addition, there were no significant differences between these abnormal findings and the performance of RFA. In the set diagram, we observed that 3 of the 7 patients with regional premature contractions showed LGE, with 1 patient showing low ejection fraction while the other 2 patients did not. The 4 patients with regional premature contractions without LGE did not present with low ejection fraction. From these findings, we deduced that continuous premature contractions might cause regional myocardial wall thinning, which might proceed to myocardial fibrosis and lead to gradual worsening of the RWMA from premature contractions to akinesia along with the occurrence of persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction even after successful RFA. \n\nThe hitherto published literatures have almost all focused on echocardiographic findings in pediatric patients, whereas we focused on CMR for adult patients, who might be diagnosed later in life and who might be exposed to the accessory pathway for a long period of time. Hence, we observed different findings such as myocardial fibrosis that could be related to persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction even after successful RFA. We thought that our research could also help explain why three pediatric patients in a previous study had irreversible heart failure in spite of RFA [ ]. Expectably, we observed that premature contractions were not noted in patients with RFA except for 1 patient with right posterior accessory pathway, who had a short time interval between RFA and CMR. Prior studies have suggested that premature contractions of the ventricle can persist after successful RFA probably due to the existence of a cardiac memory, and that these abnormal contractions might gradually return to normal contractions over a 1-month period [ , ]. However, from the results of the present study, we assumed that a few patients could have myocardial fibrosis before RFA, which might progress to regional myocardial wall thinning and akinesia, and ultimately to persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction in spite of RFA. From a different perspective, performing RFA would be a critical determinant of myocardial fibrosis. However, there was no significant difference in LGE according to RFA in the present study. In addition, RFA is usually applied to a very small area near the atrioventricular annulus after accessory pathway localization, but the areas of LGE were much larger than what would be expected with just ablation. Further prospective studies using CMR with a large study population might be necessary to confirm these findings. \n\nThis study has some limitations. First, we included a small number of patients in this preliminary study. Second, we selected eligible patients with grossly visible RWMA on echocardiography because non-visible RWMA can be related to very small areas of preexcited segment, and it would be difficult to characterize myocardium on CMR considering spatial resolution. In actual practice, however, not all patients with WPW syndrome would undergo echocardiography. This ultimately raises the possibility of a selection bias, and consequentially the incidence of LGE might have been higher than its actual value. Third, although we prospectively performed CMR in this study, not all patients underwent the EP study and clinical follow-up varied among the patients. To investigate clinical findings related to myocardial fibrosis and heart failure in patients with WPW syndrome, further prospective studies with larger populations are necessary. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe observed a relatively high prevalence of myocardial fibrosis at the preexcited myocardium of adult WPW syndrome patients, exclusively at the basal septum with septal accessory pathway in the present study. In some cases, myocardial fibrosis accompanied regional akinesia and regional myocardial wall thinning. These abnormal findings might have occurred from continuous premature contractions by the septal accessory pathway and might be related to persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction even after successful RFA. A further prospective study using CMR with a large population is necessary to identify myocardial characteristics at the preexcited myocardium in WPW syndrome, which might provide new perspectives for the disease and help develop management strategies in the future. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5983519, "text_md5": "134f1d0c727a8329ba993a4577ac2cf5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 122], "journal": [123, 131], "publication_year": [133, 137], "title": [148, 297], "keywords": [311, 311], "abstract": [324, 2334], "body": [2343, 28613]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29856866, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0198218", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983519", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5983519"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983519\">5983519</a>", "list_title": "PMC5983519  Altered myocardial characteristics of the preexcited segment in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: A pilot study with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging"}

Our objective is to present a case of upper cervical epidural abscess in a patient with PD and to review upper cervical spine infection. We present the patient\u2019s presentation, physical examination, imaging findings, and management as well a review of the literature. A 66-year-old male with PD presented to the emergency department (ED) following referral by a neurologist for a presumed C2 fracture. The preceding history was 1 week of severe neck pain requiring a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was initially interpreted as a C2 fracture. On admission from the ED, further review of the MRI appeared to show anterior prevertebral abscess and an epidural abscess. The patient\u2019s neurological examination was at baseline. In the span of 2 days, the patient developed significant motor weakness. A repeat MRI demonstrated expansion of the epidural collection and spinal cord compression. Surgical management consisting of C1 and C2 laminectomy, irrigation, and debridement from anterior and posterior approaches was performed. Postoperatively, the patient did not recover any motor strength and elected to withdraw care and died. Spinal epidural abscess requires a high index of suspicion and needs prompt recognition to prevent neurological impairment. Upper cervical spine infections are rare but can lead to lethal consequences. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nUpper cervical (occiput to C2) epidural abscess is an uncommon condition. Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) usually represent a surgical emergency because of concurrent neurological deficits. In upper cervical spine infections, degradation of the odontoid ligaments with subsequent atlantoaxial subluxation or dislocation is a risk. The incidence of osteomyelitis at this level has increased significantly over the past decades primarily due to immunocompromised hosts, intravenous drug use, and infective endocarditis. However, there remains a lack of literature on factors influencing neurological impairment or the prediction of neurological and functional recovery.  Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with progressive neurological deficit as well as musculoskeletal abnormalities,  which means a higher index of suspicion is required for rarer conditions in the atlantoaxial skeleton. In this study, we present a patient with PD who developed quadriplegia following C1\u2013C2 epidural abscess. \n\n\n## Case Report \n  \nInstitutional review board approval was not required for this study. The patient is a 66-year-old male with PD for the last 12 years and osteoporosis (T score: 3.1). He initially presented to his neurologist with a 1 week history of neck pain. There was no history of antecedent trauma, and the patient was unaware of any precipitating factors. The patient\u2019s baseline neurology was positive for mild rest tremor in both hands. He had also been exhibiting speech changes consistent with PD and in particular a quieter muffled voice for which he was undergoing Lee Silverman voice treatment. The patient did not show any other changes typical of his condition such as rigidity, bradykinesia, postural/gait changes, or micrographia. He was independently mobile, and his wife reported he was able to mow the lawn and shovel snow, despite his condition. He was being medicated with carbidopa\u2013levodopa and entacapone and calcium carbonate/Vitamin D for his osteoporosis. Neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable with normal tone in all limbs, 5/5 power in all myotomes, normal sensation in all dermatomes, normal coordination and proprioception, and active reflexes 2+ which were not brisk. He had no ankle clonus. Hoffman test was negative. Cranial nerves were intact, and pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine was ordered by the neurologist, which was read as a fracture of the lateral mass of C2 with possible involvement of the odontoid with subdural collection ( ). The patient was sent to the emergency department for management. A computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine did not show any fractures. He was admitted to the medicine service and noted to be afebrile with an initial white blood cell (WBC) of 15.2 (normal: 4.2-9.1), C-reactive protein of 248 (normal 0-10), and 84.5% neutrophils (normal: 34%-67.9%). \n  \nSagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating the fluid collection anterior to the C1\u2013C2 spinal cord (white arrow) and prevertebral fluid collection (open arrow). \n  \nAn orthopedic spine consult was requested, and on examination, the patient had no motor deficits. On review of the MRI, no fracture was identified, but there was concern regarding the prevertebral fluid collection, and an otolaryngology (ENT) consultation was requested. The ENT team did not believe that surgical debridement was necessary at this point, and following discussion with the interventional radiologists, a CT-guided aspirate was not recommended, as the collection was not sizeable enough to safely aspirate or drain. Blood cultures were positive for alpha-hemolytic   Streptococcus  . The patient was started on vancomycin. \n\nThe patient was assessed daily by the orthopedic team and remained stable clinically and neurologically for the next 48 hours. Unfortunately 2 days later, the patient\u2019s neurology deteriorated rapidly and significantly overnight with the period being approximately 8 hours. On immediate evaluation by the orthopedic team, he was found to have flaccid quadriparesis in all 4 extremities with a sensory level at T2. His reflexes diminished to 1 throughout and had downgoing toes on Babinski testing. His rectal tone remained intact. An urgent MRI of the cervical spine demonstrated significantly increased epidural collection, C2 osteomyelitis, and increased anterior prevertebral collection ( ). After discussing with the patient and family, a decision was made for urgent posterior decompression, irrigation, and debridement followed by anterior-based irrigation and debridement with the ENT service. A microscopic-assisted C1 and C2 laminectomy was performed, and the epidural abscess was drained. During the decompression, the bone quality was consistent with the patient\u2019s known osteoporosis. Pus communication from the anterior to the posterior prevertebral tissue via the C1\u2013C2 lateral mass articulation was noted ( ). Unfortunately, the patient did not regain any motor function. Intraoperative cultures returned as alpha-hemolytic   Streptococcus  . On postoperative day 5, the patient and his family elected to withdraw ventilator support after consulting with palliative care of his end-of-life wishes. The patient died within 3 hours of ventilator support removal. \n  \nA, Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken 3 days later demonstrating significant increase (arrow) in the epidural abscess. B, Communication (arrow), via the left C1\u2013C2 joint, of the paravertebral collection to the epidural collection can be seen. C, Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of C2 demonstrating epidural abscess collection compressing the spinal cord. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nSpinal epidural abscess was first described almost 250 years ago.  Upper cervical epidural abscess (UCEA; occiput to C2) in particular remains rare,  and to the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first case of UCEA in a patient with PD. \n\nPrevious reports on UCEAs have shown various etiologies including tonsillectomy,  otitis media,  laryngitis/rhinopharyngitis/parotitis,  iatrogenic,  hematogenous spread,  and immunocompromised hosts (intravenous drug use, diabetes, and HIV).  Sometimes, cases remain idiopathic. In our patient, we were unable to conclusively give an etiology for his condition, however, positive blood cultures are strongly suggestive of a hematogenous route of infection with intraoperative cultures confirming the same organism. \n\nUpper cervical epidural abscess can present with a variety of signs and symptoms including neck pain and stiffness, headaches, visual disturbance, focal neurology, raised inflammatory markers, and pyrexia. Magnetic resonance imaging is the ideal imaging modality to identify early changes, neural compromise, and to delineate specific soft tissue anatomy.  Identifying the causative organism is possible in up to 75% of cases,  with CT-guided biopsy crucial in the diagnostic pathway.   Streptococcus   species and   Staphylococcus aureus   are by far the most common causative organisms,  and in our patient, an alpha-hemolytic   Streptococcus   was isolated. \n\nTwo main modalities for the management of epidural abscess are used, either intravenous antibiotics or antibiotics with surgical decompression.  Nonoperative management with antimicrobials alone may be sufficient in some cases.  The type of management remains largely case dependent, with medical management alone being reserved for those with significant comorbidities rendering them unfit for surgery, patients with extensive SEA without neurological sequelae, and those with complete paraplegia lasting more than 48 hours.  Patients with rapidly developing neurological signs and those with worsening markers and radiological signs, despite conservative management should be treated operatively if possible. Patients with a destructive osteomyelitis or instability may need further surgery for arthrodesis/instrumentation as part of a combined single-stage or separate second-stage procedure. \n\nA review of the literature specific to UCEA management and outcome indicates early diagnosis and identification of the causative organism leads to a good outcome both operatively and nonoperatively ( ). \n  \nA Review of Cases With UCEA, Focusing on Presentation and Management. \n      \nBabat et al have previously warned of the increased complications of spinal surgery in patients with PD due to the combination of neuromuscular pathology and poor bone stock due to demineralization in addition to the degenerative risks of the general population.  Those with PD were also found to have abnormal bone metabolism due to inadequate levels of vitamin D, thereby leading to decreased Z scores and bone mineral density as reported by Sato et al.  This was built on by Johnell et al who further demonstrated a higher risk of osteoporotic bone fractures in those with PD.  This is particularly relevant for our study, as a vertebral fracture has been described as a potential cause of epidural abscess formation,  mainly through the formation of a hematoma that can lead to an infection nidus.  Parkinsonian patients are certainly more prone to traumatic incidents compared to the normal populations partly due to the above-mentioned issues with bone density. However, this could also be related to medications such as levodopa. Parkinson disease is known to affect balance and gait, and levodopa is administered in order to help with mobility, however, it does not improve balance.  The combination of poor balance and poor bone quality leads to an increased incidence of falls and fragility fractures such as the hip. \n\nIt is important to differentiate between a cervical fracture and an UCEA. The majority of cervical fractures will have a preceding high- or low-energy traumatic event. Cervical tenderness may be present in both fractures and UCEA. Upper cervical epidural abscess will more likely present with atraumatic cervical spine pain and tenderness and neck stiffness on range of movement. Systemic signs and symptoms are more likely with UCEA if hematogenous spread is present including signs of sepsis, changes in heart rate and temperature as well as raised inflammatory markers. On imaging, especially with CT, one should be able to diagnose the presence or absence of cervical fractures as was performed in our case. In either unstable cervical spine fractures or UCEA, serial neurological examinations should be performed. \n\nIn conclusion, UCEA remains a rare occurrence with no common identifiable cause. Neurologic compromise can result in high morbidity as encountered in our case even with prompt surgical management. We wish to highlight the need for a particular high index of suspicion for UCEA in a patient with PD having neck pain and raised inflammatory markers. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4647191, "text_md5": "c1497b4b9736c0943367068f9dcaf56c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 56], "journal": [57, 84], "publication_year": [86, 90], "title": [101, 168], "keywords": [182, 265], "abstract": [278, 1762], "body": [1771, 12641]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26623170, "doi": "10.1177/2151458515604356", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647191", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4647191"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647191\">4647191</a>", "list_title": "PMC4647191  Upper Cervical Epidural Abscess in a Patient With Parkinson Disease"}
{"text": "Fling, Brett W. and Cohen, Rajal G. and Mancini, Martina and Carpenter, Samuel D. and Fair, Damien A. and Nutt, John G. and Horak, Fay B.\nPLoS One, 2014\n\n# Title\n\nFunctional Reorganization of the Locomotor Network in Parkinson Patients with Freezing of Gait\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nFreezing of gait (FoG) is a transient inability to initiate or maintain stepping that often accompanies advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and significantly impairs mobility. The current study uses a multimodal neuroimaging approach to assess differences in the functional and structural locomotor neural network in PD patients with and without FoG and relates these findings to measures of FoG severity. Twenty-six PD patients and fifteen age-matched controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging along with self-reported and clinical assessments of FoG. After stringent movement correction, fifteen PD patients and fourteen control participants were available for analysis. We assessed functional connectivity strength between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the following locomotor hubs: 1) subthalamic nucleus (STN), 2) mesencephalic and 3) cerebellar locomotor region (MLR and CLR, respectively) within each hemisphere. Additionally, we quantified structural connectivity strength between locomotor hubs and assessed relationships with metrics of FoG. FoG+ patients showed greater functional connectivity between the SMA and bilateral MLR and between the SMA and left CLR compared to both FoG\u2212 and controls. Importantly, greater functional connectivity between the SMA and MLR was positively correlated with i) clinical, ii) self-reported and iii) objective ratings of freezing severity in FoG+, potentially reflecting a maladaptive neural compensation. The current findings demonstrate a re-organization of functional communication within the locomotor network in FoG+ patients whereby the higher-order motor cortex (SMA) responsible for gait initiation communicates with the MLR and CLR to a greater extent than in FoG\u2212 patients and controls. The observed pattern of altered connectivity in FoG+ may indicate a failed attempt by the CNS to compensate for the loss of connectivity between the STN and SMA and may reflect a loss of lower-order, automatic control of gait by the basal ganglia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nBalance and gait are impaired in the majority of older people, especially those with age-related, neurological degeneration such as Parkinsonism. Advanced PD is often accompanied by freezing of gait (FoG), a transient inability to initiate or maintain stepping  . Historically, freezing episodes have typically been reported in relation to repetitive lower limb movements; however, an emerging body of literature also reports   upper limb   freezing within these same patients  . Freezing of the upper and/or lower limb(s) significantly impairs mobility and limits independent function, but the neural underpinnings of freezing episodes remain poorly understood. A growing body of work suggests that these deficits in upper and lower limb movements require increased cognitive control of previously automated actions  . Recent work suggests that dysfunction of top-down inhibitory control may serve a critical role in disorders of movement initiation observed in AHDH, Huntington disease, schizophrenia and PD  . \n\nAnticipatory postural adjustments are crucial for gait initiation prior to voluntary movement and are mediated by the supplementary motor area (SMA)  ,  ,  . Impairment in inhibiting or blocking a stepping response until postural preparation is complete may be responsible for \u2018start hesitation\u2019 FoG in PD. Progressive dysfunction of circuits involving the SMA has previously been implicated in impaired step initiation in FoG associated with later stages of PD  ,  . In particular, inhibition of the SMA with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation altered the timing of anticipatory postural adjustments, and this effect was larger the more severe the PD  . These data indicate FoG may be related to dysfunction of linking step initiation with postural weight shifts. \n\nIn addition to the SMA, multiple subcortical regions are involved in locomotion, specifically the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the mesencephalic and cerebellar locomotor regions \u2013 (CLR and MLR, respectively)  . Interestingly, these are all principal areas that demonstrate metabolic increases with disease progression implicating these key motor and cognitive hubs as markers of disease progression in PD  . Our recent work demonstrated reduced structural connectivity between the pedunculopontine nucleus (a principal nucleus of the MLR) and the CLR, STN, and SMA, along with multiple regions of the frontal and prefrontal cortex in the right hemispheres of Parkinson\u2019s patients with FoG  . Furthermore, Shine and colleagues   reported   decreased   neural activity within the STN and the MLR in PD patients during freezing episodes, the magnitude of which was positively correlated with the severity of clinical FoG. Conversely, Snijders et al.   reported   increased   activity within the MLR of PD patients who experience FoG during motor imagery of normal walking, i.e. in-between freezing episodes. \n\nWhereas these task-based functional MRI studies provide isolated regions of neural activity, resting state functional connectivity analysis allows for integrative assessments of distributed neural systems. A limited body of work demonstrates functional connectivity differences within PD patients who experience freezing episodes compared to those who do not  ; however, functional connectivity within the locomotor network has yet to be explored. Taken together, these results implicate compromised structural integrity and potential functional disconnection between subcortical and cortical regions of the locomotor network in individuals who experience FoG; however, functional connectivity within the locomotor network has yet to be explored. \n\nIn the current study, we use a novel multimodal neuroimaging approach to assess differences in functional and structural connectivity of the locomotor network between PD patients with (FoG+), those without (FoG\u2212) freezing of gait, and age-matched healthy controls. We hypothesized that FoG+ patients would have reduced functional and structural connectivity within the locomotor network compared to both FoG\u2212 and control participants. Furthermore, we predicted that these declines in structural and functional connections would be strongly related to freezing severity. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Standard Protocol Approvals, Registration, and Patient Consents \n  \nOregon Heath & Science University Institutional Review Board approved this study and all participants gave their informed, written consent before beginning the experiment. \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nData were collected from 26 patients with PD and 15 age-matched controls. Participants were recruited through the Parkinson\u2019s Center of Oregon clinic at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Individuals were excluded if they could not safely walk 20 feet without walking aids, or if they had a joint replacement, musculoskeletal or vestibular disorder, dementia, claustrophobia, severe tremor, or metal in their bodies. Due to violation of strict movement thresholds during functional imaging (described below) eleven patients with PD and one healthy control were excluded from further analysis; thus, data presented are from fifteen patients with PD (14 male; age 64.7\u00b16.0 years; duration of disease 9.1\u00b16.2 years) and fourteen healthy controls (5 male; age 66.9\u00b17.8 years). Of the fifteen PD patients, eight were classified as FoG+ based on a score of >3 on the new freezing of gait questionnaire (NFOGQ)  . Seven patients scoring \u22643 were classified as FoG\u2212. All PD patients were tested in the \u201cOFF\u201d state, after 12\u201318 hour overnight withdrawal from anti-parkinsonian medications to mitigate the pharmacological effects on neural activity. Diffusion imaging data of the entire study population has previously been reported  . \n\n\n### Freezing of Gait Assessments \n  \nAll participants provided self-rated assessments of their freezing severity by filling out the NFOGQ  . Recent work has called into question the accuracy of such self-rated measurements   so we also used more objective clinical assessments of freezing. Because FoG is notably difficult to provoke in the laboratory or clinic setting, clinicians examined trials in which participants performed tight clockwise and counter-clockwise turns, a task known to elicit freezing  . Participants wore 3 inertial sensors (Opal by APDM, Portland, OR) mounted on the posterior trunk and on each shank while turning in place for 2 minutes under two different conditions: i)   single task  , turning 360\u00b0 to their right, then turning 360\u00b0 to their left, and repeating this at their own comfortable pace for 2 minutes, ii)   dual task   (wearing headphones producing a tone in the left or right ear), turning 360\u00b0 to their left or right depending on the side in which a tone was produced. The power spectral density (PSD) was calculated for each trial from the antero-posterior shank accelerations using a 4 s Hanning window with 50% overlap (using the Welch method). The total power was then normalized to the area under the PSD for each subject. A Freezing Ratio was calculated as the square of the total power in the 3\u20138 Hz band, divided by the square of the total power in the .5\u20133 Hz band  ,  . Turning trials were also video recorded and two experienced neurologists who specialize in movement disorders subsequently reviewed and provided a clinical measure of freezing severity. Scores were based upon on ordinal scale from 0\u20134 where: 0\u200a=\u200a absent, 1\u200a=\u200a mild, 2\u200a=\u200a moderate, 3\u200a=\u200a significant interference with movement, and 4\u200a=\u200a severe with risk for falls. The raters were blinded to whether the patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease were identified as having freezing of gait or not based upon their self-assessed NFOGQ score; each patient\u2019s average score and the objective Freezing Ratio in the two turning conditions were used to compare with functional connectivity. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nParticipants were scanned on a 3.0 T Siemens Magentom Tim Trio scanner with a 12-channel head coil at Oregon Health and Science University\u2019s Advanced Imaging Research Center. One high-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (orientation\u200a=\u200aSagittal, echo time\u200a=\u200a3.58 msec, repetition time\u200a=\u200a2300 msec, 256\u00d7256 matrix, resolution 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.1 mm. total scan time\u200a=\u200a9 min 14 sec) was acquired. One BOLD-weighted functional image was acquired with a T2*-weighted EPI (repetition time\u200a=\u200a2000 msec, echo time\u200a=\u200a30 msec, flip angle\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, field of view\u200a=\u200a240 mm, 33 slices covering the whole brain, resolution\u200a=\u200a3.8 mm , total scan time\u200a=\u200a10 min 6 sec). Steady-state magnetization was assumed after three volumes (\u223c 6 sec). Subjects were instructed to remain still and fixate on a standard fixation cross, projected in the center of their visual field. Three sets of diffusion-weighted images were collected using a 30-gradient direction, whole-brain echoplanar imaging sequence (TR\u200a=\u200a9,100 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a88 ms, field of view\u200a=\u200a240 mm , b value\u200a=\u200a1,000 s/mm , isotropic voxel dimensions\u200a=\u200a2 mm ) and three images in which the b value was equal to zero. A static magnetic field map was also acquired using the same parameters as the diffusion weighted sequence. \n\n\n### Functional Image Preprocessing \n  \nAll functional images were preprocessed in an identical method to best alleviate known types of artifacts  . These steps included 1) removal of central spike caused my MR signal offset, 2) correction of odd versus even slice intensity differences due to interleaved acquisition without gaps, 3) correction for head movement within the run, and 4) within-run intensity normalization to a whole brain mode value of 1000. Atlas transformation of the functional data was computed for each individual via the MP-RAGE scan  . The functional data was then resampled into atlas space on an isotropic 3-mm grid, combining movement correction and atlas transformation in one interpolation  . All subsequent operations were performed on the atlas-transformed volumetric time series. \n\nConnectivity preprocessing followed prior methods  . These steps included: 1a) a temporal band-pass filter (0.009 Hz<f <0.08 Hz), 1b) spatial smoothing (6 mm full width at half maximum). All data were computed with and without smoothing; unless otherwise stated, all results reported were drawn from the no smoothing condition, 2) regression of six parameters obtained by rigid body head motion correction, 3) regression of the whole brain signal averaged over the whole brain, 4) regression of ventricular signal averaged from ventricular region of interest (ROI), and 5) regression of white matter signal averaged from white matter ROI. Regressions of the first order derivatives from steps 3\u20135 were also included in the correlation preprocessing. These preprocessing steps are thought to best reduce variance that is unlikely to reflect neuronal activity  . \n\n\n### Motion Correction \n  \nIn an effort to account for inter-acquisition subject motion that could potentially be problematic for correlation analysis, an additional motion correction step was implemented as described by Power and colleagues  . This method, titled framewise displacement (FD), calculates a time series of volume-to-volume motion from the movement measures created by the aforementioned rigid body motion correction. This is calculated for all six parameters by the equation FD   \u200a=\u200a|\u0394  d  |+|\u0394  d  |+|\u0394  d  |+|\u0394\u03b1 |+|\u0394\u03b2 |+|\u0394\u03b3 |, where \u0394d   \u200a=\u200ad    \u2013 d   , (the same holds true for the other five parameters [  d  d  d   \u03b1    \u03b2    \u03b3   ]). Essentially, this formula sums the absolute values of the volume-to-volume changes in six directions. The rotational measures were first converted to millimeters by calculating surface displacement on a sphere of radius 50 mm, which is the approximate distance from the cerebral cortex to the center of the head. This method \u2018scrubs\u2019 the data by removing any volume that exceeds a set threshold (in this case 0.5 mm) from the time series. The correlation analysis was performed on the remaining concatenated volumes. If greater than 50% of the functional volumes (>150 out of 300) exceeded the threshold, participants were excluded from analysis. Due to excessive movement, one healthy control participant, four FoG\u2212 participants, and seven FoG+ participants were excluded. \n\n\n### fcMRI Region of Interest Selection \n  \nWe selected the SMA, STN, MLR and CLR as locomotor hubs, all of which have previously been identified as neural regions (by chemical or electrical stimulation within the cat)  ,  ,   known to initiate and pace gait ( ). All regions of interests (ROIs) were analyzed in Talairach space. For those ROIs that were initially identified within MNI space (MLR and CLR), the Lancaster transform was used to convert into Talairach space  . A 10-mm sphere was created at the peak coordinates of the SMA on the midline (  x  \u200a=\u200a0,   y  \u200a=\u200a\u22127,   z  \u200a=\u200a55) as identified by activation likelihood estimates identified in the three-dimensional locations and boundaries meta-analysis of motor regions by Mayka and colleagues  . For all sub-cortical ROIs a 6-mm sphere was created bilaterally for the STN, MLR and CLR. The STN lies ventral to the thalamus, and lateral and caudal to the hypothalamus. Peak coordinates for the STN (  x  \u200a=\u200a\u00b111,   y  \u200a=\u200a\u221214,   z  \u200a=\u200a\u22123) were chosen from the task-related activation ROI template of the human basal ganglia identified by Prodoehl et al.  . The MLR lies ventral to the inferior colliculus, in the upper pons; it comprises the pedunculopontine and cuneiform nuclei. Peak coordinates for the MLR (  x  \u200a=\u200a\u00b16,   y  \u200a=\u200a\u221230,   z  \u200a=\u200a\u221219) were selected similar to our recent work  , and were informed by local field potential recordings   and immunohistochemistry  . The CLR is located in the cerebellar midline, slightly dorsal to the fastigial nuclei; peak coordinates (  x  \u200a=\u200a\u00b17,   y  \u200a=\u200a\u221252,   z  \u200a=\u200a\u221216) were identified based on recent imaging of the supraspinal locomotor centers in the brainstem and cerebellum  . \n   Locomotor hubs used as regions of interest for functional connectivity analysis.  \nX\u200a=\u200a7 is chosen for display as it is the only slice on which all ROIs have some overlap. Please refer to the Methods section for coordinates describing the centroid of each sphere. \n  \nAs discussed in the Introduction, the SMA is thought to contribute to the generation of anticipatory postural adjustments, which act to stabilize supporting body segments prior to movement. Because dysfunction of the SMA has been implicated repeatedly in contributing to altered step initiation, functional connectivity strength was restricted to analyses between the SMA and the bilateral sub-cortical locomotor hubs assessed by correlation coefficients between each ROI pair (e.g., SMA \u2013 left STN). The mean time series from the SMA was correlated with the mean time series from each of the six sub-cortical ROIs using Pearson\u2019s coefficient of correlation (r) for each participant. We examined normality of distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all functional connectivity pairs. Assumptions for parametric statistics were met, so we compared the strength of functional connectivity between the SMA and the six sub-cortical ROIs for the three groups (controls, FoG\u2212, FoG+) using a repeated-measures ANCOVA. UPDRS score was included as a covariate for all comparisons. Significant main effects were subjected to post-hoc analyses using a two-tailed Tukey\u2019s HSD test to correct for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics v. 19). A p-value \u22640.05 was considered significant. \n\n\n### Diffusion Tensor Imaging Analysis \n  \nWe used the same methodology as employed in a previous study  . Diffusion data were processed using the tools implemented in FSL (Version 5.0;  ). The three raw data sets were first corrected for eddy current distortions and motion artifacts using the correction tool (FDT 1.0), then averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio   and subsequently skull-stripped (using FSL\u2019s brain extraction tool). The principal diffusion direction was estimated for each voxel as a probability density function, using Bayes\u2019 rules in order to account for noise and uncertainty in the measured data. As described elsewhere  , the implicit modeling of noise in a probabilistic model enables a fiber tracking procedure without externally added constraints such as fractional anisotropy threshold or fiber angle. Thus, fiber-tracking in or near cortical areas becomes more sensitive. The use of a 2-fiber model   also improves the modeling of crossing fibers. By sending out 25,000 streamline samples per seed voxel, we mapped the probabilistic connectivity distributions for each voxel in each ROI (see below). For each individual, the fractional anisotropy images were normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by using a linear (affine) registration and Fourier interpolation through the FMRIB linear image registration tool. \n\nWe performed probabilistic fiber tractography to assess   structural   connectivity strength within the locomotor network. Due to the lack of a well-defined template of the CLR\u2019s boundaries and the limited data identifying anatomical connections between the CLR and the SMA, we did not attempt to identify fiber tracts connecting these two regions. Thus, probabilistic fiber tracking was initiated from every voxel within the binarized region of interest in each participant\u2019s native diffusion space to delineate the following tracts: (1) rSTN \u2013 SMA; (2) lSTN \u2013 SMA; (3) rMLR \u2013 SMA; and (4) lMLR \u2013 SMA. The STN was defined using the human basal ganglia human area template created by Prodoehl et al.   and the SMA was defined using the human motor area template as defined by Mayka et al.  . The MLR was defined using the template recently described by Fling et al.   (See   for ROIs). Seed-masks were determined in MNI space and transformed to subject diffusion space. Streamline samples (25,000) were sent out from each voxel, with a step length of 0.5 mm and a curvature threshold of 0.2. For each connection pair, the number of samples reaching the target mask was divided by the number of voxels in the seed mask, and resulting values were used as an indicator of relative structural connectivity strength across participants  ,  . For the structural connectivity pairs we again examined normality of distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Assumptions for parametric statistics were met, so we compared the strength of structural connectivity for the three groups (controls, FoG\u2212, FoG+) using a repeated-measures ANCOVA. For all comparisons, UPDRS score was again included as a covariate. Significant main effects were subjected to post-hoc analyses using a two-tailed Tukey\u2019s HSD test to correct for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics v. 19). A p-value \u22640.05 was considered significant. Where significant main effects were identified, functional and structural connectivity strength were entered as independent variables for linear regression analysis to identify associations with metrics of freezing including: (1) NFOGQ, (2) Clinical FoG rating, (3) Objective Freezing Ratio and were corrected for multiple comparisons. \n   Structural connectivity ROIs in the A) sagittal, B) coronal, and C) axial plane.  \nThe SMA, as defined by Mayka et(2006) is shown in blue. The STN, as defined by Prodoehl et al (2008) is shown in yellow. The MLR, as defined by Fling et al. (2013), is shown in purple. All ROIs are overlaid on the MNI 1 mm template and are displayed in neurologic convention (right\u200a=\u200aright). Similar ROIs for the SMA and MLR were used in the left hemisphere (not displayed here). \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \nParticipant characteristics and freezing assessments can be viewed in  . Briefly, no difference was observed in disease severity between FoG+ and FoG\u2212, although there was a trend towards greater severity in the FoG+ group as assessed by UPDRS motor scores (  P  <0.16) and Hoehn and Yahr (  P  <0.15  )  . Patients classified as FoG+ had significantly longer disease duration than FoG\u2212. The objective Freezing Ratio was significantly higher in FoG+ participants compared to FoG\u2212, in both the single- and dual-task conditions (P<0.001). Additionally, neurologists who were blinded to participants\u2019 self-reported FoG status rated freezing as significantly more severe in FoG+ participants than in FoG\u2212 participants (  P  <0.001). Inter-rater reliability for neurologist scoring was high (ICC\u200a=\u200a0.98), and only one FoG\u2212 participant received a rating greater than 0 from the neurologists (a score of 1 from one of the two neurologists). \n   Patient characteristics.        \n### Locomotor Network Functional Connectivity Strength \n  \nNo group difference was observed with regards to the percentage of frames excluded for functional runs, and was therefore not included as a covariate in the statistical model ( ). Group differences were observed for four of the six functional connectivity comparisons: rSTN \u2013 SMA (F \u200a=\u200a4.2;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.024), lMLR \u2013 SMA (F \u200a=\u200a4.9;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.016), rMLR \u2013 SMA (F \u200a=\u200a5.2;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.013), and lCLR \u2013 SMA (F \u200a=\u200a4.3;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.026) (see  ). No group differences were observed for rCLR \u2013 SMA (F\u200a=\u200a1.79;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.19) or lSTN \u2013 SMA (F\u200a=\u200a0.776;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.57). Post-hoc   t-  tests for rSTN \u2013 SMA connectivity show significantly stronger communication for FoG\u2212 compared to FoG+ (  t\u200a=\u200a  3.37;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.006), but not compared to controls (  t\u200a=\u200a  1.71;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.2). No difference was observed between controls and FoG+. Conversely, FoG+ show significantly stronger connectivity between lMLR \u2013 SMA compared to both controls (  t  \u200a=\u200a2.95;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.008) and FoG\u2212 (  t\u200a=\u200a  2.98;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.012). Similar group differences were found between rMLR \u2013 SMA with FoG+ demonstrating greater connectivity than controls (  t\u200a=\u200a  2.97;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.008) and FoG\u2212 (  t\u200a=\u200a  3.2;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.008). Finally, connectivity strength between lCLR \u2013 SMA was significantly stronger in FoG+ than controls (  t\u200a=\u200a  3.08;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.006), but not significantly greater for FoG+ than FoG\u2212 (  t\u200a=\u200a  1.97;   P\u200a=\u200a  0.075). For the latter three post-hoc comparisons, no differences were observed between controls and FoG\u2212 participants (  P  >0.7). \n   Functional connectivity strength between the SMA and the other locomotor hubs.  \nFoG+ patients show greater connectivity to the MLR and CLR, but reduced connectivity to the STN. **  P  <0.001, *  P  <0.05. \n  \nThe overall pattern of these results demonstrated a re-organization of functional communication within the locomotor network in FoG+ patients whereby the SMA communicated with the MLR and CLR to a greater extent than in control participants or FoG\u2212 PD patients.

Nor were group differences in structural connectivity strength observed within either the lSTN \u2013 SMA (F\u200a=\u200a0.3; P\u200a=\u200a0.72) or lMLR \u2013 SMA loop (F\u200a=\u200a0.94; P\u200a=\u200a0.41). Post-hoc comparisons for the rSTN \u2013 SMA loop demonstrate greater connectivity for control participants in comparison to both FoG\u2212 (  t  \u200a=\u200a2.12;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.02) and FoG+ (  t  \u200a=\u200a1.83;   P  \u200a=\u200a0.04) groups. No difference was observed between the two PD sub-groups (P\u200a=\u200a0.8;  ). The overall pattern of these results demonstrate similar reductions in   structural   connectivity strength between the rSTN \u2013 SMA in both PD sub-groups, despite the notable difference observed in   functional   connectivity of this loop for FoG\u2212 compared to FoG+. \n   Structural connectivity between the SMA and right STN, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging.  \n A)   Normalized z-scores for structural connectivity strength between the rSTN \u2013 SMA.

Briefly, higher functional connectivity between the lMLR-SMA pair ( ), as well as between the lCLR \u2013 SMA pair, was strongly correlated with higher clinical ratings of FoG and self-reported NFOGQ scores in FoG+. Similarly, the higher functional connectivity between the rMLR \u2013 SMA pair was strongly related with higher Freezing Ratio during turning under the dual task condition in FoG+ ( ). It is worth noting that disease duration was not related to functional connectivity strength for any of the identified seed pairings, nor were any significant relationships between structural connectivity strength and measures of freezing found. \n   Associations between locomotor network functional connectivity and freezing severity.  \n A)   Functional connectivity strength of the lMLR \u2013 SMA loop was positively correlated with clinical rating of FoG severity during the single task turning condition (r\u200a=\u200a0.71).

These locomotor regions and their contributions to gait have recently been reviewed  ,  , and a growing body of literature has begun to explore the clinical implications of dysfunction within these neural hubs. The current findings demonstrate a reorganization of functional communication within the locomotor network in FoG+ patients whereby the higher order motor cortex (SMA) responsible for gait initiation communicates with the MLR and CLR to a greater extent than for FoG\u2212 or controls. Conversely, FoG\u2212 had significantly greater functional connectivity than FoG+ in the hyperdirect pathway between rSTN and SMA. The observed pattern of altered connectivity in FoG+ does not appear to serve a useful compensatory role, but rather may contribute to FoG, as evidenced by the positive association between ratings of FoG severity and increased functional connectivity in the MLR \u2013 SMA and CLR \u2013 SMA loops. Our results complement a growing body of literature indicating that age- and disease-related deficits in upper and lower limb movements are reflective of an increased need for cognitive, or higher-order motor control of previously automated actions  . \n\n### Locomotor Network Functional Connectivity \n  \nNeural regions underlying locomotor function have traditionally shown diminished functional activation in patients with PD. For example, previous work in PD patients has reported decreased activity of the SMA during gait   and diminished pre-movement electroencephalographic potentials over SMA prior to step initiation  ,  . Furthermore, Shine and colleagues   recently reported   decreased   fMRI neural activity within the STN and the MLR during freezing episodes, the magnitude of which was positively correlated with the severity of clinical freezing of gait. It is worth noting that a small number of fMRI   and PET imaging   studies have reported increased activity in the MLR in between FoG episodes providing evidence that neural activity during walking   or with imagined stepping   which may differ from neural activity during an actual freezing episode. That is to say, the increased activity in MLR during imagined normal gait   may be compensatory in-between FoG episodes when there is normal walking. With increased strain on the system (e.g. turning), this fragile and vulnerable compensation system (with decreased structural connectivity) fails, leading to FoG episodes  . \n\nWhereas studies of fMRI and PET provide insight into specific areas of activity during movement, resting state fcMRI allows for the assessment of integrated, spatially disparate neural networks. The current study allows for a greater understanding of how communication between these neural locomotor hubs is crucial for the appropriate coordination of posture with gait and the ability to adapt to changing environments that elicit freezing \u2013 e.g. turning, doorways, or crowded areas. We report that PD patients who experience freezing episodes have significantly greater communication between the SMA and the MLR and between the SMA and CLR than either FoG\u2212 or controls. The observed pattern of altered functional connectivity in FoG+ may be indicative of neural reorganization changes that may contribute to FoG rather than serving a compensatory role. We speculate that this altered pattern of connectivity within the locomotor circuitry may coincide with increased cognitive control of gait  . \n\n\n### Locomotor Network Structural Connectivity \n  \nThe current results provide the first evidence of altered structural and functional connectivity of the locomotor network within the same cohort of PD patients. Structural connectivity between locomotor hubs was analyzed via probabilistic fiber tractography. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, both PD sub-groups had reduced structural connectivity along the hyperdirect rSTN \u2013 SMA loop, despite the significant group differences in functional connectivity between these same regions. It is also important to note that the structural connectivity loss is similar in both PD groups, even though the FoG\u2212 group had significantly shorter disease duration. While it appears that structural connectivity changes occur quickly between the STN \u2013 SMA in PD, the changes in functional connectivity do not appear to be linear. Similar to previous work   the current data show that early in PD progression (e.g. the FoG\u2212 group) there was an   increase   in functional communication from the STN to the SMA, whereas later in PD progression (the FoG+ group) there was a significant   reduction   in functional connectivity. Thus, although PD patients with and without FoG show similar structural decline along the hyperdirect loop between the rSTN \u2013 SMA, we speculate that FoG\u2212 patients compensate for this loss with significantly greater functional communication as we report here. \n\nConsistent with right hemisphere involvement in response inhibition  , we have recently demonstrated reduced structural connectivity of the pedunculopontine nucleus with the cerebellum, thalamus and multiple regions of the frontal cortex solely in the right hemisphere of patients with FoG+  . Additionally, the more left hemisphere-lateralized the pedunculopontine nucleus tract volume in FoG+, the poorer the performance on cognitive tasks (Stroop task) requiring the initiation of appropriate actions and/or the inhibition of inappropriate actions  . Taken together there is mounting evidence speculating that deficits in conflict resolution (cognitive inhibition) is a principal component of freezing within PD  . \n\n\n### Cortical Contributions to FoG \n  \nAbnormal communication between cortical and subcortical structures in the presence of increased cognitive load has been proposed as a principal component underlying FoG  . Progression to more advanced PD (when FoG occurs) is likely associated with a progressive involvement of cortical structures such as the SMA  . Anticipatory postural adjustments that shift body weight to the stance leg for gait initiation are primarily mediated by the SMA  ,  ,  . It has been hypothesized that the SMA receives internal cues from the basal ganglia in order to coordinate and link together sub-movements (e.g. anticipatory postural adjustment and step initiation)  . As a result of basal ganglia dysfunction with PD progression, the SMA may lose its ability to sequence and coordinate postural adjustments and stepping. This is evidenced by studies demonstrating that anticipatory postural responses are smaller in PD   and may occur repeatedly without leading to a step  . In agreement with previous imaging work in humans   and electrophysiological recordings demonstrating excessive synchronization in basal ganglia-cortical circuitries in both humans  ,  ,   and animal PD models   we report greater functional connectivity in the rSTN \u2013 SMA loop in early stage PD patients (i.e. FoG\u2212) than in controls. While previous work   suggests that overactivity of the hyperdirect pathway plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of PD  ,  , the current results suggest that the increased activity along this loop may serve a compensatory role in PD patients who do not experience FoG, whereas this compensation is lost over time, or was never present, in FoG+ individuals. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThe current study has several limitations. Due to our strict motion correction procedures for processing of the functional imaging our sample size was noticeably reduced from the original cohort; however, when including all participants the results remain consistent ( ). Further, for those participants included within the FoG\u2212 and FoG+ groups there is a noticeable difference in disease duration. This is often an issue when attempting to match disease characteristics between groups due to the onset of freezing episodes late in disease progression  . The increased disease duration provides the nervous system with more time to compensate for the disease-related changes, which may be reflected within our imaging results. Furthermore, early in disease progression, PD symptoms tend to be more asymmetric, possibly influencing the laterality differences seen in our FoG\u2212 group. This is tempered by the fact that both PD groups\u2019 most affected side was evenly distributed and that the full cohort of data does not demonstrate laterality ( ). It is also worth noting that the current study did not find significantly reduced structural connections between the rMLR \u2013 SMA in FoG+ patients as was found in recent work  . This is likely due to the smaller cohort investigated in the current study as a result of the strict motion correction processing implemented for the functional imaging. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current study provides the first evidence of altered structural and functional connectivity of the locomotor network within the same cohort of PD patients. These results demonstrate compromised structural integrity and abnormal functional communication between subcortical and cortical regions of the locomotor network in individuals who experience FoG. Increased functional connectivity between the SMA and the MLR and CLR may be reflective of a maladaptative compensation in FoG+. The loss of structural connectivity and the subsequent reduction in functional communication observed within FoG+ between the rSTN \u2013 SMA potentially represents a loss of the ability to inhibit competing motor programs (anticipatory postural adjustments) and to initiate the correct movement (gait). Because of the STN\u2019s demonstrated association with inhibitory control the current findings add to the literature that implicates a role for executive dysfunction within the inhibitory domain leading to motor impairment in the form of FoG. The observed pattern of reduced structural and functional connectivity between the rSTN \u2013 SMA in a small sample of FoG+ patients, provides a specific target for cognitive neurorehabilitation   within these individuals. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4061081, "text_md5": "411be423f0c4e25303ed94bc7ebe7164", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 137], "journal": [138, 146], "publication_year": [148, 152], "title": [163, 257], "keywords": [271, 271], "abstract": [284, 2346], "body": [2355, 38372]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24937008, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0100291", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061081", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4061081"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061081\">4061081</a>", "list_title": "PMC4061081  Functional Reorganization of the Locomotor Network in Parkinson Patients with Freezing of Gait"}

We implemented FreeSurfer to obtain cortical thickness estimates to contrast patterns of cortical thinning across groups and their clinical correlates. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, a largely similar pattern of regional cortical thinning was observed relative to controls apart from a more severe loss within the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In Parkinson disease dementia, regional cortical thickness was indistinguishable from controls and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting an \u2018intermediate\u2019 pattern of regional cortical change. In terms of global cortical thickness, group profiles were controls\u2009>\u2009Parkinson disease dementia\u2009>\u2009dementia with Lewy bodies\u2009>\u2009Alzheimer\u2019s disease (F \u2009\u2a7d\u2009123.2,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001), where percentage wise, the average difference compared to controls were \u22121.8%, \u22125.5% and \u22126.4%, respectively.

There was preservation of the medial temporal lobe structures in dementia with Lewy bodies compared with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, supporting its inclusion as a supportive biomarker in the revised clinical criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies. However, there was less global cortical thinning in Parkinson disease dementia, with no significant regional difference between Parkinson disease dementia and controls. These findings highlight the overlap across the Alzheimer\u2019s disease/Parkinson disease dementia spectrum and the potential for differing mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) are common forms of dementia in older age, while in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), development of dementia (Parkinson disease dementia [PDD]) occurs in up to 80% of people aged 15\u201320\u2009years after PD diagnosis. Although the neuropsychiatric and cognitive presentation in PDD is broadly similar to DLB ( ), there are differences including timing of the cognitive, neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms as well as treatment responses and underlying neuropathology ( ). \n\nStructural imaging changes are well characterised in AD with temporoparietal atrophy shown to be a relatively specific disease biomarker ( ). In Lewy body disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported greater cortical atrophy in DLB than in PDD ( ;  ), while relative preservation of the medial temporal lobes compared to AD is a consistent finding across both conditions ( ;  ;  ), and significant medial temporal atrophy may indicate concomitant AD-related pathological change ( ). Studies reporting measures of cortical thickness (CTh) in DLB have shown changes in parietal, occipital, temporal and frontal cortices but to a lesser extent than in AD ( ). Cortical thinning has also been shown to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in PD ( ;  ;  ), with cortical changes becoming more widespread as the disease progresses. \n\nOur aim was to determine patterns of cortical thinning in a large and well-characterised cohort of older people with AD, DLB and PDD. Atrophic changes in DLB may lie somewhere between AD and PDD, possibly reflecting increased AD co-pathology, but no study has made direct comparisons between all the three dementia groups. We, therefore, utilised FreeSurfer to estimate CTh from structural MRI data to contrast patterns across these groups. We also investigated the clinical correlates of CTh in order to probe the clinical significance of the neurodegenerative process in these conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe investigation consisted of 245 individuals gathered from four independent study samples: 76 probable AD ( ), 65 probable DLB ( ), 29 PDD ( ) and 76 older controls. Sample characteristics were the following: study 1 (13 controls, 30 AD, 21 DLB and 16 PDD), study 2 (31 controls, 32 AD and 31 DLB), study 3 (17 controls, 13 AD and 13 DLB) and study 4 (15 controls and 13 PDD). People with probable AD, DLB and PDD were recruited from a community-dwelling population of patients referred to local old age psychiatry, geriatric or neurology services. Older cognitively normal control participants were recruited from patient spouses, friends and volunteers. Approval was sought from the Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland research ethics committees. All participants and/or nearest relatives gave written informed consent. All participants had clinical, cognitive, neurological and neuropsychiatric assessments. Cognitive function was evaluated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) ( ) and Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) ( ) tests, while motor parkinsonism was assessed using the unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale (UPDRS-III) ( ). For AD, DLB and PDD participants, neuropsychiatric features and cognitive fluctuations were measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) ( ) and the clinician assessment of fluctuations (CAF) scale ( ). \n\nStudy exclusion criteria across samples included contraindications for MRI, history of alcohol or substance misuse, severe neurological or psychiatric illness, focal brain lesions or presence of other severe or medical illness. \n\n\n### MRI \n  \nWithin 2\u2009months of their respective study assessments, all subjects underwent T1-weighted MRI on a 3-T MRI system (8-channel head coil, Intera Achieva scanner; Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), although there were slight variations in the three-dimensional (3D) MPRAGE sequence across samples.

Study 4: sagittal acquisition, matrix 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009180, TR\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, SENSE factor\u2009=\u20092, voxel output 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm . Image volumes were then orientated such that the axial plane was standardised to align with the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. \n\n\n### Cortical thickness \n  \nCTh estimates were derived for each participant from cortical surface reconstructions of the T1 images using FreeSurfer (version 5.1), the methodological details of which have been described ( ;  ;  ). In short, the analysis pipeline included non-uniform intensity correction, Talairach transformation, removal of non-brain tissue, segmentation of the white matter (WM) and deep grey matter (GM) structures, triangular tessellation of the WM\u2013GM boundary and then surface warping by tracking intensity gradients to optimally identify the WM\u2013GM and GM\u2013CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)/pial borders ( ;  ). Once cortical models were produced, surface inflation, spherical atlas registration and parcellation of the cerebral cortex into gyral and sulcal structures were performed, ( ) thereby generating a series of surface data. Representations of CTh were then calculated as the closest distance from the WM\u2013GM to pial boundaries at each vertex on the tessellated surface ( ). Examination at each step of image processing was performed to confirm the accuracies of segmentation, WM/pial surfaces and tissue classifications. Images with errors that could not be corrected were excluded. Images were then aligned to a common surface space (MNI 305) and smoothed with a 20-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) surface\u2013based Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographic and behavioural variables were tested for normality and variance homogeneity using Shapiro\u2013Wilk and Levene\u2019s tests, respectively. Where applicable, the data were examined using parametric (analysis of variance [ANOVA] F, Welch\u2019s ANOVA W) and non-parametric (Kruskal\u2013Wallis H, \u03c7 ) tests and interpreted as significant if   p  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.05. Analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS v.23.0.0.3. \n\nGroup effects and behavioural correlates on CTh were assessed vertex wise using the general linear model (GLM). CTh was modelled as a function of each group controlling for the effects of age, gender and MRI sequence (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]), CTh\u2009=\u2009\u03b2 .Con\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .AD\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .DLB\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .PDD\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .age\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .gender\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 .MRI_sequence\u2009+\u2009\u03bc\u2009+\u2009\u03b5 (where \u03bc is a constant and \u03b5 is error). An   F   contrast was derived to test whether any differences in mean CTh at each vertex existed between the four groups. The resultant surface map, converted to a binary brain mask, defined the surface subspace from which subsequent post hoc analyses were performed to establish which groups differed from each other. In particular, CTh was then modelled within the surface subspace as a function of two groups along with the nuisance covariates, where   T   contrasts generated specific pairwise comparisons (two-tailed   t   tests): Con vs AD, Con vs DLB, Con vs PDD, AD vs DLB, AD vs PDD and DLB vs PDD. Effects of measures (MMSE, CAMCOG , CAMCOG , NPI , NPI  and CAF ) on CTh were also investigated separately in AD, DLB and PDD. CTh was modelled as a function of covariate of interest, and where appropriate, controlling for effects of age, gender and MRI sequence. These contrasts tested whether the clinical variables significantly correlated with CTh in these conditions. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) ( ) probability threshold was applied (  P  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.05), controlling the expected proportion of type I errors among the suprathreshold vertices due to multiple testing across the surfaces. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics and behavioural characteristics \n  \n depicts the study characteristics. Age was broadly similar across groups; however, PDD patients were slightly younger than DLB patients. The male-to-female ratio was much greater in PDD than in AD, DLB and control participants. Global cognition (MMSE, CAMCOG ) and executive function were similar across AD, DLB and PDD, whereas memory (CAMCOG ), although comparable between DLB and PDD, was, as expected, more impaired in AD. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations were more severe in DLB and PDD than in AD, while UPDRS-III scores, again as expected, were significantly higher in DLB and PDD relative to AD and controls. \n  \nDemographic and group characteristics. \n      \n\n### Cortical thickness \n  \n illustrates the ANCOVA analysis (  n  \u2009=\u2009245), and   summarises the cluster data. Across groups, most of the cerebral cortex showed significant changes in CTh apart from areas of the inferior frontal, pre-post central gyri, paracentral, anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and medial occipital lobes, where regional CTh was similar.

Controls vs DLB: Cortical thinning was similarly widespread, i.e. in temporal, parietal and frontal lobes ( ). As in AD, areas of greatest change were in the posterior cingulate, lateral temporal and inferior parietal lobules. Entorhinal and parahippocampal changes were also apparent but to a lesser extent than AD.   summarises the cluster data. Controls vs PDD, DLB vs PDD: In PDD, CTh did not differ from healthy controls or participants with DLB ( ). DLB vs AD: Areas of significant thinning were confined only to the bilateral entorhinal cortex and left parahippocampal gyrus in AD compared to DLB. PDD vs AD: CTh was reduced in AD relative to PDD in temporal, frontal and parietal regions ( ).

For gCTh, dementia groups were lower than controls (  p  \u2009\u2a7d\u20090.006); PDD was greater than both DLB and AD (  p  \u2009<\u20090.001) but similar between DLB and AD. Percentage wise, the average (left and right hemispheres combined) reduction in gCTh relative to controls was \u22126.4%, \u22125.5% and \u22121.8% for AD, DLB and PDD, respectively. \n\n and   summarise the correlation results in AD, DLB and PDD. Significant effects on CTh were found for CAMCOG  and CAMCOG  in DLB. Lower CAMCOG  scores were associated with a pattern of decreased thickness in the bilateral medial frontal, middle temporal, inferior frontal and inferior parietal as well as right insula, right posterior cingulate, right fusiform and right medial orbitofrontal structures. Lower CAMCOG  scores were associated with a pattern of decreased thickness in the bilateral medial temporal/temporal poles, left inferior parietal, right cingulate, right superior temporal and right superior/orbito frontal regions. Interestingly, there were no significant relationships between CTh and any of the behavioural measures in AD or PDD. \n  \nVertex-wise analyses of cortical thickness (CTh) as a function of CAMCOG  and CAMCOG  in DLB.

A largely similar pattern of regional cortical thinning was apparent between AD and DLB relative to controls apart from a more severe loss within the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures in AD. In PDD, regional CTh was indistinguishable from controls and DLB, implying either a heterogeneous disease group or one with a degree of \u2018intermediate\u2019 cortical change. By averaging the regional values across the cortical surfaces, we derived measures of gCTh in these groups, where DLB, PDD and AD showed significantly lower gCTh than controls; however, PDD was also greater than DLB and AD, suggesting an \u2018intermediary\u2019 level of global cortical change in PDD. In percentage terms, the average reduction in gCTh compared to controls was \u22121.8%, \u22125.5% and \u22126.4% for PDD, DLB and AD, respectively. Cortical thinning was also associated with cognitive decline in DLB but not in PDD or AD. \n\nIn AD, there was a widespread pattern of change in CTh with the lateral temporoparietal and medial temporal areas particularly affected. Cortical thinning in AD has been extensively studied, and our results are consistent with those of previous reports ( ;  ). Relative to controls, a similar picture was associated with DLB, with evidence of some medial temporal thinning but to a lesser extent than AD. When AD and DLB are contrasted, the results suggest a largely shared pattern with the exception of the entorhinal and parahippocampal structures which are more affected in AD. It, therefore, seems that for established AD and DLB with similar levels of global cognition, DLB resembles an AD-like pattern but slightly upstream in terms of cortical thinning. An investigation of prodromal patients found CTh changes relative to controls in AD but not DLB ( ), while longitudinal studies in DLB have shown significantly lower rates of global atrophy compared to AD ( ), with higher rates of atrophy associated with increased concurrent levels of AD co-pathology (\u03b2-amyloid) ( ), which appears to support this view. \n\nCortical degeneration in DLB is heterogeneous and not entirely understood, although a contributory factor may be the presence of coexisting AD-related pathology (\u03b2-amyloid, tau). Positive emission tomography (PET) imaging has shown that around 50\u201360% of people with DLB have significant amyloid deposition ( ), with a high burden predicting a greater rate of cortical atrophy ( ). More recently, tau deposition has been reported in parietal structures in DLB utilising the tau PET tracer  F-AV-1451 ( ;  ). Amyloid-positive DLB cases had marked increases in cortical tau ( F-AV-1451 uptake) ( ), and similarly, others found increased temporoparietal and occipital tau binding correlated with global Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in DLB ( ). It seems that in DLB, people with a higher amyloid burden have additional cortical tau pathology which may then accelerate or contribute to the neurodegenerative process in DLB. Longitudinal studies utilising molecular imaging techniques (tau and amyloid) may offer insight into the evolutionary interaction of these pathologies and their effects on the clinical features, cortical atrophy and outcomes. \n\nThe pattern of regional cortical thinning associated with PDD was indistinguishable from healthy controls and patients with DLB, indicating either a heterogeneous group or one with \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels of cortical degeneration. In vivo Alzheimer proteinopathies are less common in PDD than in DLB, where studies have shown higher cortical amyloid deposition ( ) and more transitional tau retention in the former (DLB\u2009>\u2009PDD\u2009>\u2009controls) ( ). Pathologically, studies have also reported higher cortical \u03b2-amyloid and tau loads in DLB compared to PDD, which contribute to cortical neurodegeneration ( ). Therefore, less cortical thinning in PDD than in DLB is consistent with this notion. However, significant cortical thinning has been previously reported in people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD relative to controls, in contrast to our results ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Results of structural MRI change have been variable across studies utilising voxelwise, region of interest and CTh measures in PDD. Some report very little change, while others have reported widespread cortical deficits. This may be partly due to the differences in analysis methods. Some reported either uncorrected or Monte Carlo cluster-wise statistics. Cluster-wise approaches provide lower spatial sensitivity and infer a signal somewhere within a cluster. For liberal cluster thresholds, large clusters are often generated where it is then difficult to locate regions representing the true effects, and consequently, the degree of reported change may be overstated. One study that reported vertex-wise FDR-corrected results showed cortical thinning in the frontal, temporal and posterior parietal cortices in PDD (  n  \u2009=\u200915) ( ). Notably, average gCTh in PDD was similar in both studies, CTh (present study) 2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 and CTh (Zarei et al.) 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, and was greater than that in DLB, CTh (present study) 2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05. Variation in results may be partly due to global cognition (MMSE \u2009=\u200921.2, MMSE \u2009=\u200918.3), differences in cohort size and comparison group but also highlights disease heterogeneity in PDD. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to accurately assess heterogeneity in PDD. \n\nCortical thinning was associated with cognitive decline in DLB. Memory (CAMCOG ) related to a CTh pattern involving predominantly the temporal lobes and right frontal regions, whereas for global cognition (CAMCOG ), there was also a correlation with parietal and medial frontal areas. We did not detect significant effects between CTh and any of the behavioural measures in either AD or PDD. For AD, the lack of association may be due to floor effects as cortical degeneration occurs much earlier in the disease course. Cholinergic dysfunction is strongly associated with cognitive deficits, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations in PDD ( ) and may suggest that strategic loss of key corticopetal afferents from the basal forebrain rather than broad-scale cortical neuronal loss underpins cognitive impairment in this group. Despite similar levels of global cognition, the variation in the pattern and extent of cortical thinning suggests differing mechanisms underlying cognitive decline among AD, DLB and PDD. \n\nStrengths of the study include the following: a large group of probable AD, DLB and PDD patients who were matched for global cognition (MMSE and CAMCOG) and the reporting of FDR-corrected results. While combining datasets has the important advantage of statistical power, one of the disadvantages is in differing assessment procedures. This included the lack of common measures of everyday function and assessment of duration of illness. Duration of illness can be difficult to accurately assess in dementia and, especially, in DLB and PDD where diagnostic delays are common ( ). Other study limitations include the following: diagnoses were clinical rather than neuropathological and there were no measure of tau or amyloid. The effect of using slightly different MRI sequences across the study cohorts did not appear to significantly affect the vertex-wise analyses and, therefore, results but was included as a nuisance covariate for completeness. Further, CTh data from study 2 have been published ( ), while the data from studies 1, 3 and 4 have not. Future work could investigate the patterns of cortical thinning in DLB and PDD, stratified according to high/low amyloid and tau, in order to study the AD pathological burden and their effects on cortical degeneration in Lewy body disease. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur findings suggest a specific profile of cortical thinning across healthy controls, PDD, DLB and AD. The pattern of structural change in DLB was similar to that in AD, to a slightly lesser extent, while PDD appeared to demonstrate an \u2018intermediate\u2019 degree of regional and global cortical thinning. In these samples, effects of CTh on cognition were confined to DLB that may support the notion of differing processes underlying cognition across Lewy body diseases. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7285984, "text_md5": "25976b397ca5f4b60b9ec999a05289f8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 97], "journal": [98, 119], "publication_year": [121, 125], "title": [136, 213], "keywords": [227, 346], "abstract": [359, 2749], "body": [2758, 23555]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 31696728, "doi": "10.1177/0004867419885165", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285984", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7285984"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285984\">7285984</a>", "list_title": "PMC7285984  Cortical thinning in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia"}

The neural mechanisms underlying the emergence of levodopa\u2010induced dyskinesias in vivo are still poorly understood. Here, we applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the emergence of peak\u2010of\u2010dose dyskinesias in patients with PD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThirteen PD patients with dyskinesias and 13 PD patients without dyskinesias received 200mg fast\u2010acting oral levodopa following prolonged withdrawal from their normal dopaminergic medication. Immediately before and after levodopa intake, we performed fMRI, while patients produced a mouse click with the right or left hand or no action (No\u2010Go) contingent on 3 arbitrary cues. The scan was continued for 45 minutes after levodopa intake or until dyskinesias emerged. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nDuring No\u2010Go trials, PD patients who would later develop dyskinesias showed an abnormal gradual increase of activity in the presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and the bilateral putamen. This hyperactivity emerged during the first 20 minutes after levodopa intake. At the individual level, the excessive No\u2010Go activity in the predyskinesia period predicted whether an individual patient would subsequently develop dyskinesias (  p   < 0.001) as well as severity of their day\u2010to\u2010day symptomatic dyskinesias (  p   < 0.001). \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nPD patients with dyskinesias display an immediate hypersensitivity of preSMA and putamen to levodopa, which heralds the failure of neural networks to suppress involuntary dyskinetic movements. Ann Neurol 2014;75:829\u2013836 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nL\u2010dopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD).  However, long\u2010term L\u2010dopa treatment is complicated by the gradual development of involuntary movements referred to as L\u2010dopa\u2013induced dyskinesias.  Progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to increased metabolism of L\u2010dopa by nondopaminergic neurons, which can release dopamine into the striatal synaptic cleft, but lack a controlled reuptake mechanism.  Alternatively, increased dopamine turnover has been proposed as a compensatory mechanism that allows preserved dopaminergic levels in early stages of PD.  Both mechanisms result in nonphysiologic pulsatile stimulation of the putamen, which is thought to induce dyskinesias. \n\nRecent studies have evidenced a substantial progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying dyskinesias.  Although these studies have shed important insights into the pathophysiology of dyskinesias, they tell little about how synaptic and cellular changes translate to in vivo dysfunction and behavior in patients affected by PD. Neuroimaging studies of dyskinesias in humans are sparse, because dyskinesias cause movement artifacts impairing data quality. In the current study, we adopted a novel strategy to bypass this problem. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the time window between the intake of 200mg fast\u2010acting soluble L\u2010dopa and the onset of dyskinesias to avoid the presence of dyskinesias during fMRI. \n\nA previous fMRI study has demonstrated abnormal neural activity in prefrontal areas in PD patients with dyskinesias after withdrawal of medication.  However, it remains unclear how intake of L\u2010dopa modulates neural activity in patients with dyskinesias. Based on previous studies in animals  and humans,  we hypothesized that PD patients with dyskinesias would express abnormal dopaminergic modulation of the putamen and cortical areas. We further reasoned that this aberrant modulation of putaminal and cortical activity would emerge shortly after exposure to L\u2010dopa  and predict the later manifestation of dyskinesias. \n\n## Subjects and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe enrolled 36 patients fulfilling a clinical diagnosis of PD  with predominant akinetic\u2010rigid symptoms. Patients had no dementia, major psychiatric illness, pacemaker, or any contraindication regarding MRI. They did not receive any sedatives or serotonergic medication in their current treatment. \n\nTen of the 36 patients were not able to undergo the MRI scan because they did not tolerate the withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (n = 8) or developed claustrophobia in the scanner (n = 2). Thirteen of the remaining 26 PD patients had clinically diagnosed choreiform peak\u2010of\u2010dose dyskinesias without off\u2010dyskinesias, or biphasic dyskinesias (L\u2010dopa\u2013induced dyskinesia [LID] group), whereas the other 13 patients had no dyskinesias (No\u2010LID group). The presence and severity of dyskinesias were quantified using the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS). Dose of dopaminergic medication was higher in LID patients compared to No\u2010LID patients. However, the groups were closely matched with regard to disease duration and severity off and on medication. All clinical characteristics are listed in the  . We also studied 13 age\u2010matched healthy individuals but without administration of L\u2010dopa. In accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, all participants gave their informed consent before entering the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (study No. H\u20102\u20102010\u2010146). \n   Overview of Clinical and Demographic Characteristics      \n\n### Experimental Procedures \n  \nAll PD patients underwent the same experimental procedures (Fig  A). A first set of MRI measurements was acquired in a dopamine\u2010deprived state after withdrawal of all dopaminergic medication for a period corresponding to 6 half\u2010lives of the respective drug and at least 12 hours. In patients receiving dopamine agonists, this medication had to be stopped several days before the experiment. In these cases, we temporarily increased dosage of L\u2010dopa to maintain a similar level of L\u2010dopa\u2013equivalent daily dose (LEDD) until 12 hours before the fMRI experiment. Once OFF\u2010scans were completed, patients received 200mg of fast\u2010acting soluble L\u2010dopa + 50mg benserazide (Madopar Quick; La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and a second and third set of fMRI measurements were acquired after L\u2010dopa intake (post\u2013L\u2010dopa scans). Approximately 10 minutes elapsed between application of L\u2010dopa and initiation of the first post\u2013L\u2010dopa scan. \n  \nExperimental Procedures. (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. A first set of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was obtained after withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (OFF\u2010session). After initial structural and arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans, patients performed a motor task during functional MRI (fMRI; see below). The task\u2010related fMRI run lasted approximately 9 minutes, followed by a 5\u2010minute pause. Patients then received 200mg fast\u2010acting soluble oral L\u2010dopa, and the same sequence of fMRI scans was repeated twice after L\u2010dopa intake (post\u2013L\u2010dopa session), followed by a second ASL scan. If dopaminergic levels reached the threshold for triggering dyskinesias, fMRI measurements were immediately discontinued. At least 1 post\u2013L\u2010dopa fMRI scan after intake of L\u2010dopa could be acquired for all patients before emergence of dyskinesias. (B) Stimulus\u2013response mapping task. The motor task consisted of 3 different stimuli indicating that participants should press a button with their left index finger or right index finger, or refrain from any motor response (No\u2010Go). Stimuli were presented for 750 milliseconds followed by a central fixation cross with a variable duration between 2,250 and 3,250 milliseconds, resulting in a mean inter\u2010trial interval of 3,500 milliseconds. Stimuli were pseudorandomly generated using PsychoPy ( ) with equal probability of each stimulus. Each session included 50 Left, 50 Right, and 50 No\u2010Go trials and lasted \u223c9 minutes. Associations between stimulus and response were counterbalanced across participants and groups (L\u2010dopa\u2013induced dyskinesia [LID], No\u2010LID, Control), but kept constant for each participant. \n  \nIn each session, a motor task (see below), which lasted 9 minutes, was followed by a 5\u2010minute pause to avoid fatigue. A physician (D.M.H.) was always present inside the scanner room during MRI acquisition to visually observe whether dyskinesias emerged after L\u2010dopa intake. As soon as patients developed dyskinesias, MRI measurements were stopped. \n\nPrior to the OFF\u2010fMRI scans, we acquired T1\u2010weighted structural brain scans. We additionally recorded arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI to rule out putative differences in cerebral perfusion underlying L\u2010dopa\u2013induced changes in the blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent (BOLD) signal measured in fMRI.  ASL scans were performed after acquisition of the T1\u2010weighted MRI and immediately after the post\u2013L\u2010dopa fMRI scans (see Fig  A). Healthy participants underwent the same set of MRI scans as PD patients, but no L\u2010dopa was given and the set of MRI measurements was only repeated twice. The rationale of including these healthy participants was to define a physiological measure of normal task performance and task\u2010related neural activity in the OFF session. \n\n\n### Experimental Task \n  \nDuring fMRI, participants continuously performed a stimulus\u2013response mapping task (see Fig  B). Participants pressed the button of an MRI\u2010compatible computer mouse with the index finger of their right (Right condition) or left hand (Left condition), or refrained from any response (No\u2010Go condition), depending on arbitrary cues, which were presented pseudorandomly with equal probability. \n\nReaction times (RTs) and accuracy rates were analyzed to test for between\u2010group differences in task performance. Using RT as dependent variable, we computed a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors group (LID, No\u2010LID, control), run, and task laterality (left, right) after testing equality of distribution of error variance (  p   = 0.902, Levene test). Accuracy rates were compared using a nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, because Levene test showed that distribution of error variance was not equally distributed (  p   < 0.001). Between\u2010group differences in accuracy were assessed for the 3 conditions (Left, Right, No\u2010Go) and sessions. All group data are given in mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), and the significance threshold was set to   p   < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. \n\n\n### MRI \n  \nWe used a 3T Verio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32\u2010channel head coil. MRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8.4667; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). \n\nA T1\u2010weighted structural image of the brain was acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (field of view = 230mm, slice thickness = 0.9mm, repetition time [TR] = 1,900 milliseconds, echo time [TE] = 2.32 milliseconds, flip angle = 9\u00b0). T1\u2010weighted images were segmented to create individual gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid masks for ASL analysis. ASL was used to map regional cerebral perfusion before and after L\u2010dopa intake.  ASL involved FAIR\u2010Q2TIPS  sequences with 3D\u2010GRASE  single\u2010shot readout with background suppression (TR = 3,000 milliseconds, TE = 12.6 milliseconds, inversion time [TI] = 200, 400, 600, 800, 1,000, 1,200, 1,400, 1,600, 1,800, 2,000, 2,200, and 2,400 milliseconds, 1 average per TI, voxel size = 3.6 \u00d7 3.6 \u00d7 3.0mm , vessel suppression with bipolar gradients, b = 10 s/mm , 36 slices, whole brain coverage). We used Fast ASL and BOLD Bayesian Estimation Routine (FABBER) to analyze ASL\u2010based perfusion measurements. \n\nTask\u2010related BOLD signal changes were mapped using an echo planar imaging sequence (TR = 1,850 milliseconds, TE = 26 milliseconds, flip angle = 75\u00b0). A single fMRI volume consisted of 36 slices covering the entire brain (field of view = 192mm, slice thickness = 3.5mm, slice spacing = 0.2mm). Preprocessing comprised realignment, normalization, and spatial smoothing (full width at half\u2010maximum = 8mm), and high\u2010pass filtering (1/128Hz). \n\n\n### Univariate Statistical Analysis of fMRI data \n  \nAnalysis of task\u2010related BOLD signal changes was performed using the general linear model. The first\u2010level model specified 6 regressors of interest for each session, comprising Right, Left, and No\u2010Go and their first\u2010order temporal derivative. The influence of head movement artifacts was modeled by including 24 nuisance regressors derived from realignment.  We also included recordings of respiration and cardiac pulsation as nuisance covariates. \n\nWe performed independent samples   t   tests to assess between\u2010group differences in task\u2010related activity at the group level. Separate   t   tests were computed for Right, Left, and No\u2010Go after withdrawal of medication (OFF\u2010scan) to test for differences in task\u2010related activation at baseline. \n\nWe expected a gradual change in task\u2010related neural activity following L\u2010dopa intake. Therefore, using the contrast maps reflecting the temporal derivative of each regressor (Left, Right, NoGo), we compared L\u2010dopa\u2013induced linear changes in task\u2010related activity in LID and No\u2010LID patients. Here, we included the first post\u2013L\u2010dopa scan, which was available for all patients (see Results). This test enabled us to identify rapidly emerging changes in task\u2010related activity before the clinical manifestation of dyskinesias. \n\nAll fMRI results were thresholded at a cluster\u2010corrected threshold of   p   < 0.05 using the familywise error correction method. Given our a priori hypothesis that PD  and dyskinesias  would be associated with abnormal activity of the putamen, we defined the bilateral dorsocaudal putamen as a region of interest (ROI) and applied small volume correction (SVC) using a sphere 10mm in radius on the Montreal Neurologic Institute coordinates \u00b128, 2, 2 (x, y, z). \n\n\n### Post Hoc Analyses \n  \nUsing fMRI data from the first post\u2013L\u2010dopa scan, we performed a post hoc regression analysis to assess whether the gradually increasing neural response to L\u2010dopa correlated with severity of the day\u2010to\u2010day symptomatic dyskinesias as reflected by the objective UDysRS scores. In each patient, we extracted the first eigenvariate of regions, which displayed abnormal modulation by L\u2010dopa in the LID group (ie, the presupplementary motor area [preSMA] and bilateral putamen, see Results). We then entered the individual values into a linear regression model with severity of dyskinesias as dependent variable using SPSS v20 (IBM, Armonk, NY). The same regression analysis was repeated using the individual Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)\u2010III as dependent variable. Results were thresholded at   p   < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. \n\nWe used the same regional eigenvariates as in the regression analysis to predict whether an individual PD patient was diagnosed with LID. We entered the parameters of each region (n = 3) and patient (n = 26) as predictors in a binary classifier to see whether the parameters could classify a given patient as dyskinetic or nondyskinetic. For classification analysis, we applied a linear support vector machine (SVM; c\u2010value = 1)  implemented in LIBSVM v3.17 as described previously.  We used leave\u2010one\u2010out cross\u2010validation to assess classification accuracy, the true\u2010positive rate (sensitivity), and false\u2010positive rate (1 \u2212 specificity) and permutation tests (10,000 permutations) to derive the corresponding probability value. \n\nAdditional post hoc analyses included voxelwise comparisons of the mean BOLD signal between groups to test whether differences in task\u2010related BOLD signal changes could be explained by regional reduction in mean BOLD signal, for instance due to regional iron accumulation.  Because L\u2010dopa might induce regional changes in cerebral perfusion, we submitted the ASL data to an ANOVA to test for putative interactions between group (LID and No\u2010LID) and state of medication (OFF and post\u2013L\u2010dopa). These post hoc analyses had only one purpose, namely to exclude that between\u2010group differences in task\u2010related BOLD activity were associated with regional differences in mean BOLD signal or regional perfusion. Therefore, we applied SVC using spherical ROIs with 10mm radius. ROIs were centered on the peaks of the activation differences as revealed by fMRI. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Dyskinetic Effect of L\u2010Dopa \n  \nThe intake of 200mg L\u2010dopa provoked mild to severe peak\u2010of\u2010dose dyskinesias in 10 of 13 LID patients. Dyskinesias first developed in the foot on the side that was most affected by PD. Four LID patients developed dyskinesias after the first post\u2013L\u2010dopa scan \u223c20 minutes after L\u2010dopa intake. Patients with severe dyskinesias developed dyskinesias more rapidly than patients with mild dyskinesias (rho = \u22120.692,   p   = 0.009, Pearson correlation). There was no correlation between dyskinesia severity and LEDD (  p   > 0.1). Three of the 13 LID patients did not develop dyskinesias during the fMRI experiment, but showed mild dyskinesias after the fMRI experiment. These patients had the lowest objective UDysRS scores (6 points) in the LID group and received average levels of LEDD (mean = 883mg). None of the patients in the No\u2010LID group developed dyskinesias. \n\n\n### Task Performance \n  \nMean RT during the task was 667 \u00b1 72 (SD) milliseconds in the control group, 684 \u00b1 92 milliseconds in the No\u2010LID group, and 673 \u00b1 103 milliseconds in the LID group. Error rates were <4% in all 3 groups and fMRI runs regardless of response condition. There was no difference in RT between group (  p   = 0.352), session (  p   = 0.204), or response condition (  p   = 0.222), and no significant interactions among the 3 factors. Likewise, we found no differences in accuracy rates between groups in any task or session (lowest   p   = 0.33). \n\n\n### Task\u2010Related Activity in the OFF\u2010Medication State \n  \nPD patients without dyskinesias showed decreased activation of the left posterior putamen during right button presses relative to healthy controls (peak at x, y, z = \u221234, \u22122, \u22124;   Z   = 3.4), whereas the magnitude of activation in LID patients was in\u2010between these two groups (Fig  ). This difference is unlikely to be caused by differences in lateralization of PD symptoms, with 5 of 13 LID patients and 7 of 13 No\u2010LID patients presenting with right\u2010lateralized symptoms. The mean BOLD signal intensity in the left putamen did not differ among groups. For left button presses and the No\u2010Go condition, there were no significant differences in task\u2010related activity between groups in the OFF session. \n  \nDifferences in neural activation between groups in the OFF session. Parkinson disease patients without dyskinesias showed decreased activation in the left posterior putamen compared to healthy controls during right button presses. The effect sizes of the mean blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent signal change are shown in the lower panel, demonstrating that magnitude of activation in L\u2010dopa\u2013induced dyskinesia (LID) patients was in\u2010between patients without dyskinesias and healthy controls. L = left; R = right. The asterisk indicates a statistical difference of the mean at P < 0.05. \n  \n\n### Modulation of Task\u2010Related Neural Activity by L\u2010Dopa \n  \nThe first post\u2013L\u2010dopa fMRI scan yielded differences in the responsiveness to L\u2010dopa between LID and No\u2010LID patients (Fig  A). Compared to the No\u2010LID group, the LID group displayed an increased linear enhancement of task\u2010related activity in the preSMA (extending to both hemispheres; peak at x, y, z = \u22124, 8, 58;   Z   = 3.41), left putamen (peak at x, y, z = \u221228, 8, \u22126;   Z   = 3.50), and right putamen (peak at x, y, z = 34, 0, 4;   Z   = 3.05), which gradually emerged during the first 20 minutes after L\u2010dopa intake. \n  \nAbnormal modulation of neural activity following L\u2010dopa intake in L\u2010dopa\u2013induced dyskinesia (LID) patients. (A) Analysis of time modulation of No\u2010Go after L\u2010dopa intake (first post\u2013L\u2010dopa scan) showed a significantly stronger increase in activation of presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and bilateral putamen in LID patients compared to patients without dyskinesias. This was not observed during right or left button presses. Activations are shown in coronal, sagittal, and axial orientation. L = left; lPut = left putamen; R = right; rPut = right putamen. (B) Regression analysis showed that dopaminergic modulation of preSMA activity during No\u2010Go was a strong predictor of severity of emerging dyskinesia (  R   = 0.701,   p   < 0.001). (C) Dopaminergic modulation of preSMA activity did not predict severity of Parkinson symptoms (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale\u2010III scores;   p   = 0.574). (D) The linear classifier significantly predicted whether an individual Parkinson disease patient had a diagnose of LID (accuracy = 80.8%, sensitivity = 69.2%, specificity = 92.3%, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87,   p   < 0.001). (E) Three of 13 LID patients did not develop dyskinesias during the scan. Repeating the classifier for the LID patients who developed dyskinesias during the scan yielded 90% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity (AUC = 0.96,   p   < 0.001). \n  \nThe increased activity was only found in the No\u2010Go condition, where patients had to actively suppress a motor response. By contrast, left or right button presses were not associated with any between\u2010group differences in changes of task\u2010related activity. ASL measurements did not demonstrate significant differences in regional perfusion in bilateral putamen and preSMA between the LID and No\u2010LID groups, indicating that the observed changes in neural activity were not induced by perfusion differences. \n\nThe L\u2010dopa\u2013induced linear increase of No\u2010Go activity in preSMA was a strong predictor of LID severity (  R   = 0.70, adjusted   R   = 0.67, \u03b2 = 0.84,   p   < 0.001), explaining \u223c70% of the variance of individual dyskinesia scores (see Fig  B). The L\u2010dopa\u2013induced increase in preSMA activation did not predict differences in disease severity as indexed by UPDRS\u2010III\u2010scores (  p   = 0.83; see Fig  C). In the putamen, L\u2010dopa\u2013induced linear increase in No\u2010Go activity did not predict individual dyskinesia scores or UPDRS\u2010III scores (all   p   > 0.25). \n\nSVM\u2010based classification revealed that the abnormal L\u2010dopa\u2013induced response in preSMA and putamen during No\u2010Go trials significantly predicted whether patients had a diagnosis of LID (accuracy = 80.8%, sensitivity = 69.2%, specificity = 92.3%, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87,   p   < 0.001; see Fig  D). Interestingly, all 3 LID patients who did not develop dyskinesias during the 3 post\u2013L\u2010dopa fMRI scans were labeled as No\u2010LID patients by the classifier. Considering only LID patients who developed dyskinesias during the fMRI experiment yielded a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 92.3% (AUC = 0.96,   p   < 0.001; see Fig  E), corresponding to 1 false\u2010positive and 1 false\u2010negative prediction. \n\n\n### Head Movements and Physiological Noise \n  \nOverall, <0.1% of all fMRI volumes were affected by head movements >1mm. Mean pulse rate (\u00b1SD) was 74 \u00b1 12/min and mean respiration frequency was 16 \u00b1 4/min. Separate ANOVAs yielded no differences between groups and sessions with respect to head movements (ie, relative shifts >1mm between consecutive scans), pulse rate, or respiration frequency. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nUsing the BOLD signal as index of regional neural activity, we show for the first time that exposure to L\u2010dopa leads to an excessive increase in activation of the putamen and preSMA in PD patients with peak\u2010of\u2010dose dyskinesias. Hyperactivity of the putamen and pre\u2010SMA in the predyskinesia period was only observed in the behavioral context of response inhibition and was highly predictive of emergence and day\u2010to\u2010day severity of dyskinesias. \n\nWithin the basal ganglia, excessive activation in PD patients with dyskinesias was restricted to the bilateral putamen. This part of the basal ganglia is most strongly affected by dopaminergic denervation in PD  and is thought to play a central role in the pathophysiology of dyskinesias.  Hypersensitivity of striatal medium spiny neurons to pulsatile dopamine receptor stimulation during task\u2010related corticostriatal activation of glutamate receptors has been identified as a key alteration in animal models of LID.  Such a mechanism is in good agreement with our observation that the putamen shows an abnormal response to dopamine after prolonged dopaminergic withdrawal only in LID patients, but not in patients without dyskinesias. Furthermore, our findings are in accordance with previous raclopride positron emission tomography studies revealing that patients with dyskinesias display larger increases in striatal synaptic dopamine levels after L\u2010dopa administration. \n\nIn the present study, putaminal hyperactivity emerged rapidly within the first 20 minutes after L\u2010dopa intake. This predyskinesia response indicates that abnormal dopaminergic stimulation is already present before the threshold for dyskinesias has been reached and demonstrates that excessive activity is not simply a consequence of involuntary movements, which could be the case when comparing a dyskinetic with a nondyskinetic state. \n\nIn the LID group, the putamen only became overactive in a context where subjects had to block automatic response tendencies (No\u2010Go). Current models postulate that the basal ganglia play a key role in motor control.  The neural architecture of loops connecting the cortex and basal ganglia allow rapid inhibition and release of motor programs via the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways.  Importantly, these pathways are differentially modulated by dopamine. Striatal dopamine release induces movement\u2010facilitating Go feedback via D1\u2010type dopaminergic receptors and inhibitory No\u2010Go feedback via D2\u2010type receptors.  In PD, decreased dopamine release is thought to impair movement facilitation, resulting in bradykinesia. Conversely, the observed overactivity of the putamen in a No\u2010Go context in PD patients with dyskinesias might reflect an unphysiological facilitation or impaired inhibition of motor programs resulting in aberrant activity in interconnected cortical areas. \n\nAt the cortical level, the preSMA was the only area showing increased responsiveness to L\u2010dopa in the LID group. Moreover, the L\u2010dopa\u2013induced increase in No\u2010Go activity in preSMA, but not in putamen, predicted individual severity of dyskinesias. Interestingly, activation of preSMA has been linked to internally generated movements and the intention to act,  including the generation of involuntary actions.  The connectivity of this region to motor regions is abnormal in PD  and modulated by dopamine.  Furthermore, preSMA is involved in decreasing motor threshold during the speed\u2013accuracy tradeoff.  The observed overactivity of preSMA might therefore constitute an aberrant striatal feedback signal that causes an abnormal induction of internally generated movements and hereby contributes to the emergence of dyskinesias. \n\nPrevious studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have shown that interrupting function of the caudal SMA alleviates dyskinesias, but only for a limited duration.  The present results raise the question whether the results of TMS might be better if TMS directly targeted the more rostrally located preSMA. \n\nIn conclusion, we used a novel fMRI approach to assess the dynamic response of neural regions to a standard dose of fast\u2010acting soluble L\u2010dopa. We demonstrate that a rapidly emerging hypersensitivity of putamen and preSMA in the context of movement suppression can be used to predict the onset and severity of dyskinesias in individual PD patients. \n\n\n## Authorship \n  \nD.M.H., M.S.C., K.H.M., A.L., and H.R.S. designed the experiment.

A second, larger new-onset PD cohort (n = 194) was used for independent validation. Association of brain pathology with the cNfL concentration was examined with striatal dopamine transporter imaging and repeated diffusion tensor imaging at baseline and 1 and 3 years. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nHigher cNfL in the early phase of PD was associated with greater severity of all cardinal motor symptoms except tremor in both cohorts and with shorter survival and impaired olfaction. cNfL concentrations above the median of 903 ng/L conferred an overall 5.8 times increased hazard of death during follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex, higher cNfL correlated with striatal dopamine transporter uptake deficits and lower fractional anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging of several axonal tracts. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \ncNfL shows usefulness as a biomarker of disease severity and to predict survival in PD. The present results indicate that the cNfL concentration reflects the intensity of the neurodegenerative process, which could be important in future clinical trials. \n\n\n## Classification of evidence \n  \nThis study provides Class II evidence that in patients with PD, cNfL concentrations are associated with more severe disease and shorter survival. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nThe prognosis, life expectancy, and clinical presentation in Parkinson disease (PD) are highly variable.  For example, patients with PD who present with resting tremor have milder disease and longer survival compared to patients who present with gait disturbance.  Insufficient understanding of the mechanisms driving neurodegeneration and the lack of biomarkers to dynamically measure their rate hamper the development of disease-modifying therapies for PD. \n\nA promising biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases is the neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), which provides a sensitive measurement of neuroaxonal damage, regardless of cause.  NfL in CSF (cNfL) was higher in patients with PD compared with healthy controls in some but not all studies.  While many patients with PD have normal levels,  we previously showed that high cNfL in early PD predicts later progression to PD dementia.  In animal models of PD, experimental induction of \u03b1-synuclein deposition in neurons is associated with marked increases of cNfL.  Higher cNfL levels might be explained by a more aggressive and widespread neurodegeneration in a subset of patients with PD. \n\nAmong idiopathic parkinsonian disorders, increased cNfL is particularly evident in multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome,  i.e., diseases with more extensive neurodegeneration than typical PD. Technological advancement has now allowed sensitive quantification of NfL in blood, which may allow accessible monitoring.  However, NfL is not well studied as a biomarker of neurodegeneration in PD. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the severity of PD is related to cNfL levels and whether cNfL levels predict survival. To further investigate possible correlation with neurodegeneration, striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging and specific symptoms such as hyposmia were also studied in relation to cNfL as secondary endpoints. Finally, because magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive marker for axonal tract damage in early-stage PD  and may expose regional patterns of disease pathology in relation to cNfL increases, we repeated DTI in the population-based PD cohort. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study populations \n  \nAll patients in the original cohort participated in a population-based incidence study of unselected cases of new-onset idiopathic parkinsonism from a geographic catchment area of \u2248142,000 inhabitants in northern Sweden (the New Parkinsonism in Ume\u00e5 [NYPUM] study). The inclusion period was between January 1, 2004, and April 30, 2009. A population screening procedure was performed to avoid selection bias and to make PD case identification as complete as possible.  Patients with atypical parkinsonism (e.g., multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 31), secondary parkinsonism (e.g., drug-induced parkinsonism or stroke), or dementia at baseline, defined by an Mini Mental State Examination score <24 and clinical symptoms, were excluded. These patients are described in previous publications.  Patients with incident PD (n = 143) were included and followed up prospectively with standardized clinical examinations, including the modified Hoehn and Yahr (HY) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), at least yearly. Medication was documented by levodopa equivalent daily dose. MRI and presynaptic imaging of DAT status with  I-FP-CIT SPECT were done repeatedly. Of the 143 enrolled patients with PD, 99 agreed to CSF collection by lumbar puncture at study entry (baseline). The patients who declined collection of CSF (n = 44) were older than the patients who participated (74.3 vs 69.8 years) but had comparable scores for mood, motor, and cognitive dysfunction. \n\nFor validation, a second cohort consisting of all patients with new-onset, idiopathic parkinsonism referred from primary care to the neurologic department at Ume\u00e5 University Hospital (which is the only neurologic department in the area) from May 2009 to September 2018 (the validation cohort) was investigated. All patients with PD were offered a lumbar puncture for CSF analysis around the time of diagnosis. One hundred ninety-four patients with new-onset PD agreed to perform CSF collection and were included. In agreement with the exclusion criteria in the original cohort (the NYPUM cohort), patients with secondary parkinsonism, atypical parkinsonism, or dementia at baseline were excluded. All patients were investigated by neurologic examination and motor assessments at baseline. In both cohorts, a diagnosis of PD required agreement among the examiners (neurologists specialized in movement disorders) that the clinical criteria for the diagnosis were fulfilled according to the UK PD Society Brain Bank criteria.  The diagnosis of PD was neuropathologically verified at autopsy in 6 cases in the population-based cohort. \n\nFor comparison, 30 healthy control participants that were age- and sex-matched to the first 50 patients included in the NYPUM cohort were recruited. Controls were recruited by advertisements in the local newspaper, and in a few cases among friends and family of the PD participants. Requirements for controls were that they had no neurological disorders, had a normal neurological exam, and normal 123I-FP-CIT SPECT brain imaging. \n\n\n### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents \n  \nAll participants provided informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Medical Ethics Board in Ume\u00e5, Sweden (Um dnr 03-387, dnr 2014-163-31M) and was performed in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Clinical evaluation \n  \nIn both cohorts, motor function was assessed in the early phase of PD, before dopaminergic medication was started at baseline, with the HY scale and the UPDRS. In the NYPUM cohort, the UPDRS scores were divided into subscores for tremor (sum of items 20 and 21) and postural imbalance and gait difficulty (PIGD; the sum of items 13\u201315, 29, and 30).  Bradykinesia (measured by the sum of UPDRS items 23\u201326 and 31) and axial symptoms (measured by the sum of UPDRS items 18, 27\u201329, and the neck rigidity of item 22) were also investigated. Data on UPDRS subscales were lacking in the validation cohort. Instead, the most predominating symptom that first led the patient to contact a health care service was recorded and classified as (1) resting tremor, (2) bradykinesia (including, e.g., micrographia and clumsiness) (3) balance impairment or gait difficulty (e.g., shuffling gait, freezing of gait, or postural imbalance), or (4) other symptom. In the NYPUM cohort, olfactory function was tested at baseline and after 1 year by the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test.  Mobility was measured by the Timed Up and Go test, which is the time it takes to rise up from a chair, walk 3 m, and sit down again. \n\n\n### Survival \n  \nAfter inclusion, all surviving patients in the population-based cohort (NYPUM) were followed up yearly for \u22488.5 to 13.5 years, until August 31, 2017. The surviving patients in the validation cohort were followed up until October 31, 2018. The survival data were complete for both cohorts. All-cause mortality was studied as the relevant outcome. \n\n\n### Imaging with SPECT and CSF analysis \n  \nAll 99 patients with PD from whom CSF was collected in the NYPUM cohort, all 194 patients in the validation cohort, and 30 age-matched healthy controls underwent presynaptic DAT imaging by  I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN; GE Healthcare BV, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) SPECT at baseline. All patients had a pathologic scan. The DAT imaging protocol in the population-based study (NYPUM) was performed within a nonprofit trial (EU No. 2009-011748-20) and constituted a substudy within the research project. Semiquantitative analysis (based on regions of interest) and visual evaluation of the DAT SPECT were done unbiased by clinical information. Normal reference values were derived from the healthy control participants,  and reduction of DAT uptake in the putamen and caudate of the patients with PD was measured in SDs of the normal values. The imaging protocol, equipment, and semiquantitative evaluation methods were described earlier.  Two different SPECT cameras were used during the course of the population-based study; 1 brain-dedicated SPECT camera (the Neurocam) was later substituted by a multipurpose hybrid SPECT/CT (both General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Twenty-two patients performed DAT imaging in the Neurocam and 77 in the hybrid SPECT/CT. \n\nStandard procedures for lumbar puncture for collection of CSF were used, with the patient lying in the decubitus position. In the validation cohort, the lumbar puncture was generally performed somewhat later than in the NYPUM study, within 2 to 3 months from the first (baseline/diagnostic) visit. While on dopaminergic treatment, CSF collection was repeated in the NYPUM cohort after 1 and 3 years in 53 and 35 patients, respectively. The patients who participated in repeat CSF collection had a lower HY stage than the other patients with PD (1.9 vs 2.3 at 1 year) but comparable ages and UPDRS scores. CSF levels of NfL were measured with a sandwich ELISA (NF-Light; UmanDiagnostics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden), as described by the manufacturer.  The coefficient of variation was 14.0%. All analyses were performed by experienced, board-certified laboratory technicians using procedures approved by the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment. The CSF analyses were performed by investigators blinded to all clinical data. \n\n\n### Diffusion tensor imaging \n  \nIn the NYPUM cohort, 45 of the 99 patients with PD from whom CSF was collected at baseline had a 3.0T MRI scan at baseline. Twenty and 14 patients had both the MRI scan and CSF collection at the 1 and 3-year follow-ups, respectively. Magnetic resonance DTI was performed with single-shot spin echo planar imaging sequences with the following parameters: repetition time shortest, echo time 77 milliseconds, flip angle 90\u00b0, field of view 224 \u00d7 224 mm, acquisition matrix 112 \u00d7 112, reconstruction matrix 256 \u00d7 256, b value 1,100 s/mm , 70 slices (continuous), 16 gradients, and 2-mm slice thickness. One nongradient (B0) volume was also sampled. The extracted B0 image was used in the procedure of realignment and motion and eddy current correction,  with linear/quadratic terms applied for the spatial model of the eddy current\u2013induced field and linear terms for the model of the diffusion gradients. Postprocessing of the images included conversion from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format, eddy current correction, and brain extraction. The images were processed with the diffusion toolbox FSL ( ). All images were visually checked after correction, and no sample was disregarded on the basis of improper correction. The DTI map of fractional anisotropy (FA) was generated by fitting diffusion tensors to the corrected data. The postprocessing followed the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics method, which is part of the FSL package.  The most typical patient was used for normalization. Randomize (part of the FSL package) was finally used to reveal areas in the brain where FA correlated negatively with cNfL levels (i.e., lower FA correlated with higher NfL). \n\n\n### Statistics \n  \nBaseline correlations between PD phenotype, severity scales, striatal DAT imaging uptake, and cNfL concentrations were tested by Spearman \u03c1 or Pearson   r  , as appropriate. Differences in cNfL concentrations between the PD cohorts, between PD subtype groups, and between patients and controls were tested by 1-way analysis of covariance to allow adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. These tests were conducted after log-transformation of cNfL values to obtain normal distributions. Associations between PD phenotype, severity measures, and cNfL in the larger pooled cohort (n = 293) were also analyzed with multiple linear regression, and differences per unit of change of cNfL (measured by \u03b2 values) were estimated with and without adjustments. In these analyses, the normality of data was assessed by inspection of residuals. Possible change of cNfL over time was investigated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate whether the baseline cNfL level predicted mortality. Kaplan-Meier plots show effects on survival of a baseline cNfL concentration below/above the overall median in PD (903 ng/L) and in the highest and lowest quartiles. The predictive value of baseline cNfL levels was described by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and levels below/above cutoffs with the highest Youden Index (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1) were investigated for all patients who were followed up until death or 5 or 8 years. To investigate cNfL in relation to striatal dopaminergic denervation, DAT-uptake ratios were normalized by average SDs above or below the normal mean (i.e.,   z   score) to equate the numerical values derived from the 2 different scanners that were used. Negative correlation between white matter integrity measured by FA and the cNfL concentration was analyzed. All correlations were adjusted for age and sex. So as not to exclude possible brain regions of interest a priori, the 10 largest contiguous correlation clusters (all being >30 voxels) for each occasion (baseline, 1 year, and 3 years) where all voxels exceeded the significance threshold   p   < 0.05 (uncorrected) are reported. \n\nValues of   p   < 0.05 were considered significant. However, in analyses with several tests (the comparisons shown in  ), Tukey honest significance difference and Holm-Bonferroni correction were applied to correct for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 23.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). \n  \nCharacteristics of the 2 PD cohorts and healthy controls \n    \nAssociation of clinical features in PD with cNfL level \n    \ncNfL concentrations in different PD subtypes \n  \n\n### Data availability \n  \nAnonymized data can be obtained by request from any qualified investigator for purposes of replicating procedures and results. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Baseline characteristics of the cohorts \n  \nA total of 293 patients with incident, treatment-naive PD (38.6% female and 61.4% male) and 30 neurologically healthy controls were included in this study. At baseline, there were no major demographic differences between the healthy controls and the patients with PD or between the PD patients in the population-based (NYPUM) and validation cohorts ( ). However, the patients with PD in the population-based cohort were marginally older than the patients in the validation cohort (69.8 vs 68.0 years,   p   < 0.05) and had higher HY and UPDRS scores (  p   < 0.001) and higher cNfL concentrations (  p   < 0.05). Their cNfL concentrations were also higher compared with the healthy controls (  p   < 0.05), and this difference remained significant after adjustment for age and sex. In both PD cohorts, as well as in the controls, cNfL concentrations correlated positively with age (  r   range = 0.54\u20130.63). The variance of cNfL tended to be higher in PD than in the controls ( ), and cNfL concentrations were similar in male and female patients (median 950 vs 798 ng/L,   p   = 0.101). In the 6 patients with an autopsy-verified diagnosis of PD (who had a mean age of 73.3 years at baseline), the baseline cNfL concentration ranged from 504 to 3,490 ng/L, and the baseline median was 1852 ng/L. \n   Survival in PD in relation to baseline cNfL concentration  \n(A) Box plots of baseline neurofilament light chain protein in CSF (cNfL) levels in Parkinson disease (PD). Cumulative survival for patients with a baseline cNfL below the median concentration of 903 ng/L (blue line) compared with those with cNfL above 903 ng/L (red line) in the (B) New Parkinsonism in Ume\u00e5 (NYPUM) cohort and (C) validation cohort. (D) Cumulative survival in the combined, pooled cohort for patients (n = 293) with baseline cNfL levels in the lowest (<660 ng/L; blue line) and highest (>1,255 ng/L; green line) quartiles and those with concentrations between these levels (red line). \n  \n\n### cNfL, disease severity, and survival in PD \n  \nIn both PD cohorts, the cNfL concentration correlated positively with motor symptom severity as measured by clinical scales, except for tremor ( ), with and without adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration and (at 1 year) medication. At baseline, after additional adjustment for multiple comparisons, a higher cNfL concentration correlated positively with the total UPDRS score, the UPDRS Part III score, the bradykinesia and axial symptom subscores, the Timed Up and Go test, and the severity of hyposmia (as measured by the Brief Smell Identification Test) in the NYPUM cohort. The correlations between symptom severity and cNfL were in the range of   r   = 0.28\u20130.48 (  p   values between 0.005 and <0.001,  ). Tremor showed no correlation. At the 1-year follow-up in the NYPUM cohort, a positive correlation remained between the baseline cNfL concentration and the severity of all tested symptoms (the PIGD, bradykinesia, and axial subscores and with hyposmia) except tremor. In the validation cohort, a positive cNfL correlation was confirmed for the UPDRS Part III and total UPDRS scores, and there was a significant correlation with the HY stage. In the NYPUM cohort, patients with tremor-dominant PD at the first visit had cNfL concentrations similar to those of the healthy controls, while patients with mixed or PIGD subtypes had higher concentrations (median difference 238 ng/L,   p   < 0.05 and 440 ng/L,   p   < 0.05, respectively). However, after adjustment for age and sex, patients with all PD phenotypes had significantly higher cNfL concentrations than the controls. The cNfL concentration also differed in relation to the major presenting symptom in the validation cohort ( ), with patients presenting with balance impairment or gait difficulty (n = 30) having a higher cNfL concentration than patients presenting with bradykinesia (  p   < 0.05) or resting tremor (  p   < 0.01). These differences remained significant after age adjustment. In patients with repeated measurements, cNfL did not change significantly between baseline and the 1-year follow-up but increased between the 1- and 3-year follow-ups (median increase 98 ng/L,   p   = 0.030). \n\nIn the NYPUM cohort, the follow-up was complete until 8 years. Of the 99 patients with CSF samples in this cohort, 13 (13.1%) had died at 5 years and 27 (27.3%) at 8 years. Nine patients died during follow-up in the validation cohort. The most common cause of death in all patients with PD was pneumonia, consistent with a previous study.  Other causes were described in the same study. A higher cNfL concentration at baseline predicted a shorter survival in the NYPUM cohort (  p   < 0.001), and this finding was confirmed in the validation cohort (  p   < 0.001). The hazard ratio (HR) for death during follow-up increased 1.36 times in the NYPUM cohort and 3.57 times in the validation cohort per 1\u2013ng/mL increase in cNfL ( ). Considering all 293 patients in the pooled PD cohort, cNfL concentrations above the overall median of 903 ng/L around the time of diagnosis (as measured by the baseline sample) conferred a 5.8 times higher hazard for death during follow-up (95% confidence interval 2.82\u201311.85,   p   < 0.001;   and  ). Among patients with a low baseline cNfL concentration, below 965 ng/L and 925 ng/L (which were the cutoffs with the highest Youden index, and similar to the levels in the controls), 100% and 91% of the patients survived during the next 5 or 8 years, respectively. The AUROC for predicting survival by the cNfL concentration was slightly higher at the earlier (AUROC 0.79,   p   < 0.001) compared to the later (AUROC 0.75,   p   < 0.001) time point. \n  \nMortality in PD in relation to baseline cNfL concentration \n  \n\n### Relative impacts of age and cNfL on disease severity \n  \nOlder age in PD correlated with higher cNfL concentration (increasing \u224838 ng/L per year). However, all associations between cNfL and clinical features and survival remained significant after adjustment for age. An increase in 1 unit of cNfL at baseline (in ng/mL) in the pooled PD cohort was associated with an increase in the HY stage by 0.2 (  p   < 0.001), in the UPDRS Part III score by 4.1 points (  p   < 0.001), and in the total UPDRS score by 3.9 points (  p   < 0.001). The increases in clinical scores were somewhat lower after adjustment for age and sex ( ). However, as shown by higher standardized \u03b2 values in the multivariable models, the cNfL concentration was a stronger predictor of UPDRS scores than age. The standardized \u03b2 for cNfL was 0.24 (  p   < 0.001) and for age was 0.13 (  p   = 0.012) in the prediction of the UPDRS Part III score and 0.21 (  p   = 0.002) and 0.18 (  p   = 0.010), respectively, in the prediction of the total UPDRS score (showing a stronger impact of cNfL than of age). Age contributed slightly more than cNfL to predict the HY stage, but cNfL also contributed significantly. \n\nThe association between high baseline cNfL and shorter survival in PD remained significant after adjustment for age and sex in both cohorts, as well as in the pooled cohort ( ). In the validation cohort, high baseline cNfL was a stronger predictor for death during follow-up than was the age of the patient, rendering age at baseline a nonsignificant covariate (  p   = 0.183). \n\n\n### cNfL in relation to brain imaging \n  \nThe severity of striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake deficits was positively correlated with the cNfL concentration at baseline ( ). The strongest correlation was found in the right hemisphere and in the caudate nucleus. The anatomic locations where axonal fiber disintegrity, as measured by the FA value derived from DTI, correlated with a higher cNfL in clusters with at least >30 voxels are shown in  . Associations between cNfL concentration and axonal lesions on DTI were found, e.g., in the anterior and posterior limb of internal capsule unilaterally (at the right side) at the level of the thalamus at baseline. This finding was more pronounced and found bilaterally at a similar location after 1 year, together with several cNfL-associated lesions on DTI in frontal lobe axonal tracts in proximity to the cortex, and at 3 years in the pons and, among other locations, the limbic lobe (  and  ). \n  \nRelation of brain imaging findings with cNfL concentration in PD \n     Imaging of impaired diffusion associated with cNfL elevations in PD  \nBrain diffusion tensor imaging of patients in the New Parkinsonism in Ume\u00e5 (NYPUM) cohort. Imaging was performed in 45, 20, and 14 patients with Parkinson disease (PD) at baseline (left) and the 1-year (middle) and 3-year (right) follow-ups, respectively. For all contiguous diffusion tensor imaging clusters, the fractional anisotropy value in all individual voxels significantly correlated with the neurofilament light chain protein in CSF (cNfL) level after adjustment for age and sex. A more yellow color denotes a larger cluster. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this population-based and clinical study of incident PD, we investigated whether high cNfL levels in the early disease phase reflect disease severity and risk of increased mortality at follow-up. We show that higher cNfL was related to more severe PD symptoms, as measured by clinical scales, and shorter survival in the population-based NYPUM cohort, as well as independently, in the validation cohort. These relationships were evident although the absolute cNfL values at the group level were not particularly high in PD compared with many other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  At the subgroup level, however, the cNfL values were higher in patients with PD presenting with postural instability or gait difficulty compared with patients with other phenotypes of PD. \n\nIn the population-based NYPUM cohort, all patients with incident idiopathic parkinsonism in the studied area, rather than the referred cases, were included to avoid selection bias. This PD cohort should therefore provide information that is generalizable to the real-life experience of the population with idiopathic PD. Of note, some differences between the population-based and validation cohorts (consisting of the referred, consecutive patients with new-onset PD) were found. The HY stage and disease severity as measured by the UPDRS were higher in the population-based cohort. The cNfL level in the population-based cohort was higher than in the validation cohort, and this was not explained by the minor age difference. Even so, the relationships between higher cNfL, increased PD severity, and higher all-cause mortality were similar in both cohorts. \n\nIn the validation cohort, the follow-up period was shorter and there were fewer fatalities than in the NYPUM cohort, but the increase in the HR for death per unit of baseline cNfL increase (HR 3.6) was higher. cNfL was a stronger predictor of death during follow-up than age in this cohort. These characteristics may indicate that cNfL is a particularly sensitive marker of increased mortality in early PD. \n\nThe reason for the marked disease heterogeneity in PD is largely unknown but could relate to differences in the pattern or extent of neurodegeneration.  Tremor-dominant PD is consistently associated with a more benign prognosis and less striatal dopamine depletion compared with non\u2013-tremor-dominant phenotypes.  The tremor-dominant phenotype is also associated with a lower risk of dementia, less cortical pathologies, and a longer life expectancy.  In the present study, more severe bradykinetic-rigid or axial symptoms, postural instability, and gait impairment were related to higher cNfL, while tremor was unrelated. This may be consistent with less nigrostriatal degeneration and less cortical pathology in tremor-dominant PD. Our results add to the hypothesis that resting tremor may reflect a relatively benign circuit dysfunction in PD. \n\nDTI is an MRI technique that measures water diffusivity in white matter axon tracts. FA represents the directionality of diffusion, which is particularly sensitive to microstructural integrity in axons.  Axonal tract degeneration is detectable early in PD, and there is evidence that DTI changes precede changes observed on conventional, structural MRI such as atrophy.  Brain areas that have shown altered diffusion in PD include the substantia nigra and thalamic projections, the projection fibers from the substantia nigra to the striatum, and subcortical-cortical, callosal, and cortical pathways such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus. \n\ncNfL-correlated diffusion impairments in this study were found, among other locations, in internal capsule axon tracts unilaterally (at the right side) at the level of the thalamus at baseline and after 1 year more markedly and bilaterally in a similar location. At 3 years, such cNfL-associated lesions were found in the right-sided superior corona radiata (possibly in axon tracts extending from the internal capsule) in proximity to the frontal cortex and in the cingulum and pons. This longitudinally developing pattern of cNfL associated axon fiber disintegrity on DTI may reflect a progressive, spreading pathology in PD. Although the resolution limitations call for some caution, the observed pattern could suggest the spread of \u03b1-synuclein disease pathology in connected axonal projecting systems of the brain, with a predominant caudo-rostral course. The early finding (at baseline and the 1-year follow-up) of several cNfL-associated lesions in association fiber tracts of the cerebral hemispheres such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus and axon tracts of the frontal lobe is in agreement with previous findings in PD. \n\nSPECT and PET studies in PD consistently show more prominent denervation of dopaminergic neurons in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus. The caudate nucleus is affected later, as a result of disease progression.  Early denervation in the caudate nucleus, which was related to higher cNfL in the present study, may therefore be a more sensitive marker of rapidly progressive neurodegeneration compared with the putamen. Impaired function of the caudate nucleus is also related to a higher risk of developing dementia and a shorter life expectancy in PD.  The reason for the possible right-sided disease predominance in our imaging data is unknown, but this predominance also was observed in a previous study. \n\nOur center has extensive experience in using DTI for visualizing neuronal fiber disintegrity.  Even so, it is not clear exactly what the cNfL-related white matter lesions on DTI represent. They may represent pathologic processes other than the \u03b1-synuclein proteopathy of PD. NfL concentration is also, for instance, increased by ischemic small vessel disease  and Alzheimer disease.  Comorbid brain pathology such as ischemic small vessel disease or Alzheimer disease pathology could contribute to increased mortality in PD and DTI findings and may relate to balance and gait impairment in PD.  However, the finding that increased cNfL is associated with lower striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake, higher scores in validated PD severity scales, and hyposmia indicates that the increase of cNfL is at least partially specific for PD neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the cNfL-related lesions on DTI were not found in areas typically affected by chronic, ischemic vascular injury such as in the periventricular white matter.  Hence, the cNfL levels appear to reflect the intensity of the neurodegenerative process of PD. In parkinsonism, high cNfL could increase the suspicion of either a more aggressive form of PD or (if atypical features are present) atypical parkinsonism. Because of the close correlation between cNfL and NfL measured in blood, the biomarker qualities of cNfL are also likely to pertain to even more accessible blood NfL. \n\nThe possibility of uncontrolled confounding factors and the limited number of neuropathologic diagnoses and healthy control participants are further limitations of this observational study. The risk of incorrect PD diagnosis was nonetheless minimized by long follow-up by specialized neurologists at a movement disorders unit and the finding of pathologic uptake on DAT imaging in all patients. The population-based and prospective study designs are strengths. The possibility of unspecific findings on DTI, as discussed above, limits inferences in relation specifically to PD pathology. However, the repeat DTI in patients with PD enables a search for disease patterns that are likely to change over time. \n\nNo validated neurochemical biomarker exists in PD to measure disease activity and to predict prognosis. NfL is likely to have clinical utility in PD for several purposes, e.g., as shown by the ability to predict disease severity and long-term survival in 2 different PD cohorts. NfL may enhance the selection of patients with PD in clinical trials by enrichment of patients with a faster disease progression. Further research is needed to determine whether NfL in CSF or blood can be used to longitudinally monitor the progression of PD or whether NfL increases can be reversed by neuromodulatory therapy. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7605503, "text_md5": "48953faf7b7c0f95654a89a0783d3905", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 168], "publication_year": [170, 174], "title": [185, 259], "keywords": [273, 273], "abstract": [286, 2006], "body": [2015, 33430]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32680941, "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000010084", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605503", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7605503"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605503\">7605503</a>", "list_title": "PMC7605503  NfL as a biomarker for neurodegeneration and survival in Parkinson disease"}

Imaging studies also suggest a link between structural and functional changes in the frontal lobe (a region commonly associated with cognitive function) and mobility. People with Parkinson\u2019s disease have important changes in cognitive function that may impact rehabilitation efficacy. Our underlying hypothesis is that cognitive function and frontal lobe connections with the basal ganglia and brainstem posture/locomotor centers are responsible for postural deficits in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease and play a role in rehabilitation efficacy. The purpose of this study is to 1) determine if people with Parkinson\u2019s disease can improve mobility and/or cognition after partaking in a cognitively challenging mobility exercise program and 2) determine if cognition and brain circuitry deficits predict responsiveness to exercise rehabilitation. \n\n\n## Methods/Design \n  \nThis study is a randomized cross-over controlled intervention to take place at a University Balance Disorders Laboratory. The study participants will be people with Parkinson\u2019s disease who meet inclusion criteria for the study. The intervention will be 6\u00a0weeks of group exercise (case) and 6\u00a0weeks of group education (control). The exercise is a cognitively challenging program based on the Agility Boot Camp for people with PD. The education program is a 6-week program to teach people how to better live with a chronic disease. The primary outcome measure is the MiniBESTest and the secondary outcomes are measures of mobility, cognition and neural imaging. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results from this study will further our understanding of the relationship between cognition and mobility with a focus on brain circuitry as it relates to rehabilitation potential.  \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \nThis trial is registered at clinical trials.gov ( ). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nFalls due to balance and gait impairments are one of the most important health and quality of life issues in the elderly. Parkinson Disease (PD) is responsible for more falls than any other chronic disease and imposes a heavy burden on over 3\u00a0% of people over 65\u00a0years [ ]. Until recently, gait and balance were largely perceived as automated, biomechanical processes that did not require cortical control. However, work over the past decade has demonstrated the important relationships between balance/gait/falls and cognition [ ,  ]. In fact, 60\u00a0% of older people with cognitive impairment fall annually, approximately twofold more than cognitively intact peers, and the worse the cognitive deficits, particularly executive dysfunction, the more often people fall [ \u2013 ]. These studies support the notion that mobility and cognition are connected, perhaps because mobility relies upon common cortical-subcortical networks subserving cognition and balance. Executive function, defined as a set of higher order cognitive processes that control, integrate, organize and maintain other cognitive abilities, is often altered in people with PD. [ \u2013 ] Specific deficits include response inhibition, set switching and updating of working memory [ \u2013 ]. All of these executive components are required for functional mobility in everyday environments and the relationship between such function with balance and rehabilitation has not been explored in people with PD [ ,  ]. \n\nImaging studies also suggest a link between structural and functional changes in the frontal lobe (a region commonly associated with cognitive function) and mobility. A recent European study of 415 older people used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to show that parkinsonian signs of slow walking speed, and falls are related to white matter loss in the frontal cortex, but not the basal ganglia [ \u2013 ]. Likewise, a recent systematic review that included eighty-six published studies using various imaging modalities to relate neuroimaging to mobility reported that there were consistent finding across imaging modalities linking frontal lobe measures with mobility performance [ ]. Specifically, this targeted review supports an increased cortical control of gait in aging, reduced volume in several regions of grey and white matter that relate to impaired mobility and consistent neuroimaging findings that reveal the basal ganglia, parietal and frontal cortices and cerebellum are related to mobility outcomes [ ]. Recent work identifying the locomotor neural network, which includes the i) supplementary motor area, ii) subthalamic nucleus, iii) mesencephalic and iv) cerebellar locomotor regions, also provides evidence for reduced structural and altered functional connectivity in people with PD [ ,  ]. \n\nThough mobility and cognitive function may be related, rehabilitation of such deficits typically remains separate. There is some evidence that cognitive training may improve motor function and that mobility training may improve cognitive function in the elderly but a recent meta-analysis on this topic revealed limited and low quality studies [ ]. Although many individual studies of exercise and rehabilitation interventions report success in improving balance and gait in people with PD, the overall effect size of many interventions are sometimes minimal, often not reaching the minimally important change and/or minimal detectable change levels [ \u2013 ]. The limited success of rehabilitation treatment for mobility problems in people with PD may be because current physical therapy treatment does not directly address deficits related to frontal cortex dysfunction, such as cognition and cognitive control of balance and gait. \n\nWe recently documented that rehabilitation using the Agility Boot Camp (ABC) training resulted in multiple improvements in mobility such as turning, gait speed, sit-to-stand, and balance in people with PD. [ ] With our increasing interest in the interaction of cognition and mobility, we adapted the ABC program to incorporate additional cognitive, particularly executive function, challenges known to be impaired in people with PD, now called Agility Boot Camp-Cognition (ABC-C). The purpose of this study is to 1) determine if people with PD can improve mobility and/or cognition after partaking in the ABC-C program compared to a control intervention of education and 2) determine if cognition and postural, cognitive, and brain posture/locomotor circuitry deficits predict responsiveness to the cognitively challenging Agility Boot Camp (ABC-C) rehabilitation. Our underlying hypothesis is that frontal lobe connections with the basal ganglia and brainstem posture/locomotor centers play a large role in postural deficits in people with PD and that postural impairments will be related to executive cognitive impairments. We will also determine which postural, cognitive and circuitry impairments predict efficacy of cognitively-challenging mobility rehabilitation. \n\n\n## Methods/design \n  \nThe study is a cross-over, randomized, controlled trial design to determine responsiveness to the ABC-C exercise program. The study will include 120 people with PD (Fig.  ). People will be randomized into either an exercise (case) or education (control) 6-week intervention period. They will cross over after 6\u00a0weeks to receive the other treatment. Both interventions were designed to have the same frequency and will be delivered by the same exercise trainers for all sessions. Preceding the interventions, all patients will be tested on multiple measures of mobility cognition, and imaging. This same battery of tests will be administered after 6\u00a0weeks of intervention before the participants cross over into the second intervention. A final assessment will occur at the end of the second and final treatment arm (Table\u00a0 ). All other interventions (medication, other interventions, exercise) will be kept as stable as possible and any changes in medication will be monitored. This trial is registered at clinical trials.gov (NCT02231073) and OHSU ethics committee has approved all aspects of the study. All research is in compliance with the Helsinki Declarations.   \nConsort diagram \n  \n\n### Participants \n  \nInclusion criteria for PD recruitment are a) ages 50\u201390 years old, without major musculoskeletal or peripheral or central nervous system disorders (other than PD) that could significantly affect their balance and gait, b) no recent changes in medication, excessive use of alcohol or recreational drugs, c) no history of structural brain disease, active epilepsy, stroke or acute illness, factors affecting gait such as severe joint disease, weakness, peripheral neuropathy with proprioceptive deficits, severe peripheral vascular occlusive disease, severe musculoskeletal disorders, uncorrected vision or vestibular problems, or dementia that precludes consent to participate or ability to follow testing procedures, d) ability to stand or walk for 2\u00a0min with or without an assistive device, e) no medical condition that precludes exercise, f) no claustrophobia, severe tremor, or any health history (implanted devices, Deep Brain Stimulation, etc.) that would interfere or put the subject at risk near the powerful magnetic field of the MRI scanner. Though the majority of participants will have the diagnosis of idiopathic PD a subset of people with frontal gait disorder may be included for pilot data analysis. Participants will also be assessed at baseline on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment as a global screening of cognition. All subjects will be tested at Oregon Health & Science University. All subjects will sign an informed consent and no minors will be included in the study. \n\n\n### Idiopathic PD inclusion criteria \n  \nThe United Kingdom Brain Bank criteria will be used. i.e., bradykinesia and at least one of the following: rest tremor (4\u20136\u00a0Hz), muscular rigidity, and postural instability not cause by visual, vestibular, cerebellar or proprioceptive dysfunction. Three or more of the following must be present for diagnosis of idiopathic PD: unilateral onset, rest tremor, progressive, persistent asymmetry, excellent response to levodopa, levodopa-induced dyskinesia [ ]. All PD subjects will be Hoehn and Yahr Levels II-IV and responsive to levodopa. \n\n\n### Sample Size \n  \nWe computed power to detect differences between the intervention arms in a crossover trial via analysis of variance with level of significance set to 0.05 (SAS software v9.3). We assumed baseline levels and patterns of change similar to those reported in King 2013 [ ]. We examined the significance of treatment effect from 1000 simulated replications of a crossover trial. The trial is comfortably powered (85\u00a0%) with 120 patients if total Mini-BESTest score increases by 2.4 points on average in the ABC arm, and only 1.3 points on average in the control arm. We predict a roughly 20\u00a0% drop-out rate, which is conservative based on our previous experience with short duration trials of rehabilitation in PD and by others [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Randomization and blinding \n  \nSubjects will be randomly assigned per centralized database; Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCAP) to either Education (ED) or Exercise (EX) first after passing the phone screening procedure. A computerized block randomization in will be centrally held in the redcap database-scheduling mode. Randomization will be implemented by an independent statistician using a block size of twelve subjects. The exercise trainer (unblinded) will notify the subjects by phone. The researchers who will be performing all pre, mid and post-tests will remain blinded to group assignment throughout the duration of the study. \n\n\n### Intervention \n  \n#### Exercise \n  \nSubjects will participate in an 80-minute, group (6 per group) exercise session led by a certified exercise trainer knowledgeable in the ABC-C program for 3\u00a0days per week for 6\u00a0weeks. Trained research assistants will spot participates with high fall risk. Although the literature does not provide a clear dose\u2013response for balance exercise intervention, there is consensus that a challenging program at higher doses (at least 2\u00d7/week) will show improvement [ ,  ]. The exercise protocol is an adaptation of our ABC exercise program for PD (Table\u00a0 ) [ ] The theoretical basis for ABC is based on research from our laboratory and others that identified the primary neurophysiological and cognitive constraints that limit balance and mobility in PD [ ,  ]. The exercises are designed as a circuit to challenge movement-skills known to be impaired in PD. Stations will include: (1) Gait training (2) PWR Moves \u00a9 [ ], (3) Agility course, (4) Lunges, (5) Boxing and (6) Tai Chi [ ]. Each activity was chosen for its inherent focus on multi-directional movements, dynamic postural transitions, axial mobility, big movements and whole body motor sequencing. Each station is engaged for 10\u201320 minutes with rest periods in between stations. Each station is systematically progressed from beginning to intermediate to advanced levels by challenging: (1) divided attention with secondary cognitive tasks, (2) response inhibition, (3) limiting external sensory cues, (4) increasing speed and resistance.   \nOverview of exercise and education interventions \n  \n\n\n#### Education \n  \nThe Education program is a chronic disease education program to teach patients how to live better with their chronic condition. It was developed by our research team to be specific for people with PD. It will include content and discussion of topics such as sleep, nutrition, and medication management (Table\u00a0 ). Classes will consist of a group of subjects (up to 6) meeting with the trainer for 90-minute session, once a week for six weeks. In order to match dose of the education intervention with the exercise intervention, participants will be provided relaxation tapes to be used at home 5 times per week for 30\u00a0minutes for an overall education dose of 240\u00a0minutes; similar to the exercise dose [ ]. \n\nCompliance will be recorded at each session by the exercise trainer for both exercise and education. For the education arm, participants will record compliance for the relaxation sessions in a logbook. The trainer will code progression of exercise difficulty at the end of each week to determine the level of exercise progression for each person. Additionally, participants will state the level of perceived exertion (0\u201310 scale) after each exercise session. People will also wear hear rate monitor during class in order to assess the aerobic level of work being performed during exercise. \n\n\n#### Assessment procedures \n  \nAll people who are eligible per phone screening will come into the clinic for the informed consent process. An investigator will verbally explain the consent form, allow the person ample time to ready through the consent form and then will acknowledge consent by signing the form. All subjects will first read and sign consent forms. All outcomes will be measured in the practical OFF levodopa state (12\u00a0hours withdrawal). At baseline, people will be assessed on imaging, mobility and cognitive measures and will repeat the mobility and cognitive measures after the 1st six-week intervention and again after the 2nd six-week intervention (Table\u00a0 ).   \nSecondary outcome measures by domains \n  \n\n\n\n### Primary outcome measure \u2013 Mini-BESTest \n  \nThe primary outcome measure on which the intervention study was powered is the clinical   Mini-BESTest.   [ ] The   Mini-BESTest   [ ] is a sensitive measure of dynamic balance and includes 14 items (a maximum and best score of 28) [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Secondary outcome measures \n  \nSecondary measures for clinical measures, mobility (gait and balance), cognition and imaging domains are listed in Table\u00a0 . \n\n\n### Clinical Measures \n  \nOur clinical tests will include assessment of quality of life, balance confidence, disease severity and freezing of gait. Specifically, the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) [ ] will be used for quality of life, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) [ ] will be used for balance confidence, the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale ( MDS UPDRS-Motor- Parts 1-IV) will be used to measure disease severity [ ,  ] and the new freezing of gait questionnaire will be used as a self assessment of freezing of gait [ ]. \n\n\n### Mobility Testing \n  \nAll secondary measures of mobility come from performance of tasks while subjects are instrumented with body-worn, inertial sensors. Specifically, eight wireless, synchronized, Opal inertial sensors (APDM, Inc) will be applied with elastic Velcro bands to both feet, ankles and wrists, as well as the lumbar spine and mid sternum of the torso. Inertial sensor data collected at 128Hz will be wirelessly transferred to a laptop for automatic generation of gait and balance metrics by Mobility Lab and raw data for further analysis with Matlab [ ]. Participants will perform tasks of quiet stance, the 2-minute walk test and the 360-degree turn test with and without a secondary, cognitive task (Table\u00a0 ). All participants will wear a safety belt during the walking tasks and a trained research assistant will walk along side the participants. If a participant loses his or her balance, the research assistant will assist and prevent a fall. All safety measures will be taken to ensure a secure and comfortable environment. To prevent fatigue, participant will be repeatedly reminded that he or she may take a break whenever needed. \n\n\n### Cognitive testing \n  \nParticipants will complete a battery of cognitive tests to assess several dimensions of cognition. A table of all cognitive tests and a brief description is presented in Table\u00a0 . Most tests are categorized into the three domains of executive function defined by Miyake and colleagues (2000):   inhibition   (Stroop color-word test, Flankers, Go/NoGo, Stop Signal Reaction Time Test) [ \u2013 ],   set shifting   (Trail Making, Shifting Task) [ ,  \u2013 ] and   updating or working memory   (Dot Counting Test) [ ]. We will also assess general cognition for people with PD via the Scales for Outcome of Parkinson\u2019s Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-COG) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [ ,  ]. In addition, visuospatial function (Benton Judgement of Line Orientation) will be assessed. \n\n\n### Imaging \n  \nThe subject will be led into the MRI magnet room and positioned on the MRI system bed. A 32-channel Siemens rf-receiver coil will be placed appropriately for brain MRI, and the subject will be loaded into the magnet. During imaging, the subject\u2019s head will rest on a special neck and head pillow to minimize head movements. Extra pillows under the knees and back will be used to make subjects as comfortable as possible. They will wear headphones to dampen noise during imaging and to allow subjects to hear and talk to the investigators at all times. Our procedures do not include administration of MRI contrast agents. The following protocol will then be executed: \n\nImaging data will be acquired using a 3.0\u00a0T Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio scanner with a 12-channel head coil. We will collect one whole brain high-resolution structural T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (sagittal, TE\u2009=\u20093.58\u00a0ms, TR\u2009=\u20092300\u00a0ms, 256 x 256 matrix, resolution\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mm , 1 average, total scan time\u2009=\u20099\u00a0min-14\u00a0s). We will also collect high angular resolution diffusion imaging using an echo-planar imaging sequence (72 different gradient directions, b-value\u2009=\u20093,000\u00a0mm/s , TR\u2009=\u20097100\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u2009112\u00a0ms, 2.5\u00a0mm \u00a0voxels, 48 slices, FOV\u2009=\u2009230\u2009\u00d7\u2009230\u00a0mm). Finally, we will acquire a resting-state functional MRI (  rs  -  f  MRI) using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (TR\u2009=\u20092500\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u200930\u00a0ms, FA\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, 3.8 mm volexs, 36 slices with interleaved acquisition, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm). We will acquire two 10-minutes runs, providing a total of 20\u00a0minutes of resting state data for each subject in the study. Subjects will be instructed to lie still and keep their eyes open. Head padding will be provided to help subjects keep their heads still, earplugs will protect against scanner noise, and a leg bolster will be provided for back comfort. The technician will monitor the data and collect an extra scan if head movement\u2009>\u20091\u00a0mm is apparent. \n\n#### Statistical Analysis \n  \nFirst, we will compare the amount of improvement in the Mini-BESTest with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, controlling for age. It is possible that lower functioning patients will have larger adaptation to ABC-C since they start out with less function. Alternatively, it is possible that the lower functioning patients will have poorer exercise tolerance so will improve less so we will also control for baseline Mini-BESTest  .   Because we are utilizing a crossover design, the treatment effect will represent change during the ABC-C versus control rehabilitation periods regardless of whether a patient received the ABC-C intervention during period 1 or period 2. We will assess, but do not anticipate, period by treatment group interaction effects. We will also enter an interaction term into the model to assess for differential intervention effects cognitive and/or frontal lobe structural and functional connectivity status. Second, we will relate the percent improvement in the Mini-BESTest with ABC-C intervention with baseline measures of posture/gait impairments, cognitive impairments and both structural and functional connectivity of the Posture/Locomotor circuit at baseline with linear regression models. Previous studies have shown the Minimal Detectable Change of the Mini-BESTest was 3 points [ ]. We will also determine how many subjects move from high- to low-fall risk; a cutoff score for identifying PD fallers from non-fallers with the Mini-BESTest is 19/28 (63\u00a0%), with a sensitivity of .98 in 80 subjects [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe overarching goal of this study is to determine if cognitive function and frontal brain circuitry deficits predict responsiveness to exercise. Specifically, we are interested in understanding if certain phenotypes that best predict responsiveness to high intensity, short duration agility rehabilitation with a focus on cognition will help guide therapists to identify candidates for therapy and to develop specific therapy for specific types of mobility disabilities from parkinsonism. To date, there are very few studies on cognitive contributions to gait and balance as they relate to rehabilitation, particularly in this challenging population. Currently, physical therapists do not routinely incorporate cognitive challenges for people with PD and furthermore, it is unclear if these patients will benefit from such training. \n\nIf we find that executive function deficits and reduced structural and/or functional connectivity of the locomotor circuitry predict poor responses to challenging balance rehabilitation, that supports our hypothesis that frontal (and prefrontal) lobe impairments limits rehabilitation efficacy. If particular impairments of balance and gait improve more than others with ABC-C, this information will be used to improve the ABC-C intervention and will be followed by studies focused on determining which postural domains are most amenable to improvement with rehabilitation. The results from this study will further our understanding of the relationship between cognition and mobility with a focus on brain circuitry as it relates to rehabilitation potential. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4619336, "text_md5": "0abe24cba65cfff588aee9b69862c1b6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 171], "journal": [172, 182], "publication_year": [184, 188], "title": [199, 319], "keywords": [333, 390], "abstract": [403, 2342], "body": [2351, 23848]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26499867, "doi": "10.1186/s12883-015-0474-2", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4619336", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4619336"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4619336\">4619336</a>", "list_title": "PMC4619336  Do cognitive measures and brain circuitry predict outcomes of exercise in Parkinson Disease: a randomized clinical trial"}
{"text": "Cui, Bin and Zheng, Weimin and Ren, Shan and Chen, Zhigang and Wang, Zhiqun\nFront Aging Neurosci, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nDifferentiation of Cerebellum-Type and Parkinson-Type of Multiple System Atrophy by Using Multimodal MRI Parameters\n\n# Keywords\n\ncerebellum-type of multiple system atrophy\nParkinson-type of multiple system atrophy\nvoxel-based morphology\nregional cerebral blood flow\namplitude low frequency fluctuation\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nRecent studies have demonstrated the structural and functional changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, little is known about the different parameter changes of the most vulnerable regions in different types of MSA. In this study, we collected resting-state structure, perfusion, and patients with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of cerebellum-type of MSA (MSA-c) and Parkinson-type of MSA (MSA-p). First, by simultaneously using voxel-based morphology (VBM), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), we analyzed the whole brain differences of structure, perfusion, and functional activation between patients with MSA-c and MSA-p. Second, we explored the relationships among structure, perfusion, function, and the clinical variables in patients with MSA. Finally, we extracted the MRI parameters of a specific region to separate the two groups and search for a sensitive imaging biomarker. As a result, compared with patients with MSA-p type, patients with MSA-c type showed decreased structure atrophy in several cerebella and vermis subregions, reduced perfusion in bilateral cerebellum_4_5 and vermis_4_5, and an decreased ALFF values in the right lingual gyrus (LG) and fusiform (FFG). Subsequent analyses revealed the close correlations among structure, perfusion, function, and clinical variables in both MSA-c and MSA-p. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of bilateral cerebellum_4_5/vermis_4_5 could differentiate the two groups at a relatively high accuracy, yielding the sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 79.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.936. These findings have important implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology of different types of MSA and added the new evidence for the disrupted rCBF, structure, and function of MSA, which may provide the potential biomarker for accurately detecting different types of patients with MSA and new ideas for the treatment of different types of MSA in the future. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, pathologically characterized by deposition of alpha synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in several specific regions including the striatum, cerebellum, and olivopontine structures (Brettschneider et al.,  ; Krismer et al.,  ). Clinically, MSA is mainly divided into MSA-p type with poor levodopa-responsive parkinsonian syndrome, and MSA-c type with cerebellar ataxia syndrome. However, the clinical differentiation between patients with MSA-c and MSA-p is challenged by the presence of clinical features common to both forms, resulting in the relatively high rate of misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment at clinical practice. Previous researchers have applied structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) in aiding the differential diagnosis between MSA-c and MSA-p type (Matsusue et al.,  ; Deguchi et al.,  ; Krismer and Wenning,  ; Chelban et al.,  ; Dash et al.,  ), and found that structural atrophy was mainly concentrated in the putamen, middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), pons, and cerebellum. Another study found no structural abnormalities in MSA patients with MSA (Chelban et al.,  ), which inspires us to find some more sensitive technique to reach an accurate differential diagnosis of the disease. \n\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive technique that can provide quantitative information of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) (Zhang,  ). Ideally, the use of ASL might show a higher discriminative value than the sMRI technique, because the hypo-perfusion injury always occurs earlier than the structural atrophy. The ASL technique takes the inflowing magnetically labeled arterial blood as exogenous an contrast agent, instead of routine contrast-enhanced MRI (Hartkamp et al.,  ). Moreover, ASL has several other advantages, such as higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition, and stability (Haller et al.,  ). So far, only two MSA studies have focused on the ASL application. One of the previous studies revealed the decreased rCBF in several cerebellum subregions in patients with MSA-c type (Zheng et al.,  ). Another ASL study focused on differentiation of the Parkinson's disease (PD) and MSA, although the authors performed some perfusion comparisons between patients, with MSA-c and MSA-p they did not further extract the imaging biomarkers to classify the different types of MSA (Erro et al.,  ). \n\nRecently, increasing attention has focused on exploring MSA-related intrinsic brain activity changes during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). For the intrinsic brain activity, by using the regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach, the researcher found the motor network dysfunction in patients with MSA (You et al.,  ). Besides the ReHo method, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) played an important role, which can directly reflect regional spontaneous brain activity by calculating the square root of the power spectrum of the rs-fMRI signals in a low-frequency range (Zang et al.,  ). In one of the previous studies, we used the ALFF method to examine the whole brain activity changes and observed significantly decreased ALFF values in several cerebellum regions in patients with MSA-c type (Ren et al.,  ). Another study focused on MSA-p type and revealed decreased ALFF values mainly in bilateral basal ganglion, as well as increased ALFF values in right cerebellum and parieto-temporo-occipital cortex (Wang et al.,  ). These results were based on the comparison between MSA subtype (MSA-p or MSA-c) and normal controls. However, there was no study directly comparing the ALFF changes between MSA-c type and MSA-p type. \n\nBased on the previous studies of structure, perfusion, and function, it trigged the interests in the relationship among the three multimode MRI parameters in different subtypes of MSA. In addition, no study investigated the association among these multimode MRI parameters simultaneously in MSA disease. Additionally, the association between the MRI parameters and clinical performances in patients with MSA is not very clear. Thus, to deeply understand the specific patterns of structure, perfusion, and functional activity in different MSA subtypes, we performed the current study by using the multimodal MRI methods. First, we aim to analyze the whole brain differences of structure, rCBF, and ALFF values between MSA-c and MSA-p. Second, we intend to explore the relationships among perfusion-structure-function coupling of MSA-c and MSA-p. Furthermore, we will explore the correlation between the multimodal MRI parameters and the clinical variables. Finally, we intend to extract the MRI parameters of a specific region to separate the two groups and search for an imaging biomarker of the disease. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-four patients with MSA-c type and 13 patients with MSA-p type were recruited at the clinic of Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. There was no statistical difference in age and gender between the two groups. The diagnosis of MSA-c and MSA-p type was according to the established international diagnostic criteria of probable MSA defined by the American Academy of Neurology and American Autonomic Society (Gilman et al.,  ). All subjects were evaluated by complete physical and neuropsychological examinations including Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS). The clinical examinations were performed on the day before MRI scanning. The inclusion criteria for controls were as follows: (1) there were no neurological or psychiatric disorders including obsessive disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and so on; (2) there was a lack of significant cognitive decline (Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score > 24); (3) there were no neurological deficiencies including visual or hearing loss; (4) there were no treatment with deep brain stimulation or operation; (5) there was no evidence of movement disorder, vascular brain lesions, brain tumor, and/or marked cortical and/or subcortical atrophy on MRI scan. The exclusion criteria for the subjects were as follows: the subjects of hemorrhage, infarction, tumors, trauma, or severe white matter (WM) hyperintensity were excluded from the study. Clinical and demographic information of the subjects were shown in  . \n  \nClinical and demographical data. \n  \n MSA-c, cerebellum-type of multiple system atrophy; MSA-p, Parkinson-type of multiple system atrophy; UMSARS, Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale  . \n  \nAll subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethical Committee of Dongfang Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. \n\n\n### Data Acquisition \n  \nMRI data acquisition was performed on a GE 3.0T Discovery 750 scanner. Foam padding and headphones were used to control head motion and scanner noise. High-resolution anatomical images were collected using a 3D brain volume T1-weighted sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/ echo time (TE)/inversion time (TI)/ flip angle (FA) = 8,150 ms/3.17 ms/450 ms/12\u00b0, resolution = 256 \u00d7 256 matrix, slices = 188, thickness = 1 mm, voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm . The 3D-ASL data were acquired using the following parameters: TR/TE = 2.0 s/14 ms, post-label delay (PLD) = 2.0 s, field of view (FOV) = 256 \u00d7 256 mm , matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, in-plane resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 mm , bandwidth = 2,232 Hz/px, phase partial Fourier = 6/8, echo-planar imaging (EPI) factor = 64. Twelve slices of 6 mm thickness were acquired. The resting-state BOLD image parameters were as following: TR/ TE/ FA = 2,000 ms/30 ms/90\u00b0, FOV = 24 \u00d7 24 cm , resolution = 64 \u00d7 64 matrix, slices = 36, thickness = 3 mm, gap = 1 mm, voxel size = 3.75 \u00d7 3.75 \u00d7 3 mm , and bandwidth = 2,232 Hz/pixel. All subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax, move as little as possible, think of nothing in particular, and stay awake during the scans. \n\n\n### Image Analysis \n  \n#### Voxel-Based Morphology (VBM) Analysis \n  \nT1-weighted images were preprocessed with the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) ( ) software implemented in MATLAB 2013a (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA). First, the T1 structural images were segmented into gray matter (GM), WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) areas, using the unified standard segmentation option in SPM12. Then, images were spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by employing the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm. The normalized GM and WM components were modulated for non-linear change and then smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half-maximum (FWHM). \n\n\n#### rCBF Analysis \n  \nThe images with differences in 3D-ASL were averaged, and the rCBF map was calculated with the weighted reference image of proton density (Xu et al.,  ). Image processing was also performed using SPM12 software. First, the rCBF images were normalized to the MNI space. Then, to reduce the individual variance, the normalized rCBF images were standardized using the mean division. Finally, each standardized rCBF map was spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM. \n\n\n#### ALFF Analysis \n  \nResting-state functional MRI data preprocessing was performed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) (Yan and Zang,  ). The preprocessing steps included data conversion, removal of the first 10 volumes, slice timing, and head motion correction. Head motion between volumes was evaluated and corrected using rigid-body registration, and the dataset with maximum translation exceeding 2.5 mm and maximum rotation exceeding 2.5\u00b0 were excluded from this study. To spatially normalize the fMRI data, the realigned volumes were spatially standardized into the MNI space using the EPI template. The functional images were resampled into a voxel size of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm . Then, the functional images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 4 mm FWHM. Finally, several nuisance covariates (24 motion parameters, their first-time derivations, WM, and CSF) were regressed out from the data. After preprocessing, the effects of low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise (respiratory and cardiac rhythms) were reduced by time bandpass filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) of the fMRI data. Next, to acquire the power spectrum, the time series was transformed to a frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT) (parameters: taper percent = 0, FFT length = shortest). And then the power spectrum was square-rooted and averaged across 0.01\u20130.08 Hz at each voxel. This averaged square root was viewed as the ALFF. For standardization purposes, the ALFF value of each voxel was divided by the global mean ALFF value to standardize data across subjects. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nTo assess the between-group differences (between the patients with MSA-c and MSA-p) of the rCBF, GM, and WM volumes, and ALFF values in the whole brain, two-sample   t  -tests were performed with age, and gender as covariates using SPM12. The significance threshold was set to Family-wise error (FWE) correction at the cluster level (  p   < 0.05). In addition, multiple comparisons analysis were performed to identify the relationships among perfusion-structure-function coupling of patients with MSA-c and MSA-p type. A note needs to be made here that the multiple comparisons analyze were performed among the average values on regions of interest (ROIs), and the ROIs were obtained by the two-sample   t  -tests of the rCBF, GM, and WM volumes, and ALFF in the whole brain between MSA-c and MSA-p. \n\nThen, a partial correlation analysis was performed with age, and gender as nuisance covariates, to evaluate the associations of the clinical variables with the rCBF, GM, and WM volumes, and ALFF values in the patients with MSA-c and MSA-p type. \n\nFinally, we use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with SPSS20.0 to obtain a sensitivity and specificity imaging biomarker for the differential diagnosis of patients with MSA-c and MSA-p type. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nTwenty-four patients with MSA-c and 13 patients with MSA-p type completed the sMRI, ASL, and fMRI scans. Demographic and clinical data for all the participants were shown in  . No statistically significant differences were found between patients with MSA-c and MSAp type in age and gender (  p   > 0.05). \n\n\n### Differences in Structure, rCBF, and Function Between the Patients With MSA-c and MSA-p \n  \nCompared to the patients with MSA-p type, the patients with MSA-c type showed significantly decreased GM volumes (right cerebellum_1, cerebellum_6 and cerebellum_8, left cerebellum_2, cerebellum_1 and cerebellum_7b, left cerebellum_4_5, vermis_4_5, and vermis_3), and WM volumes (bilateral cerebellum_9 and left cerebellum). When compared with patients with MSA-p type, the patients with MSA-c type presented decreased rCBF in bilateral cerebellum_4_5 and vermis_4_5. In addition, we also found the decreased ALFF values in the right lingual gyrus (LG) and fusiform (FFG) in the patients relative to patients. The peak voxels within those significantly different clusters were shown in   and  . \n  \nDifferences of structure, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and function between the patients with MSA-c and MSA-p.   (A)   Compared to the patients with Parkinson-type of multiple system atrophy (MSA-p type), patients with data of cerebellum-type of MSA (MSA-c type) showed significantly decreased gray matter (GM) volumes in right cerebellum_1, cerebellum_6 and cerebellum_8, left cerebellum_2, cerebellum_1, cerebellum_7b, cerebellum_4_5, vermis_4_5, and vermis_3;   (B)   MSA-c presented significantly decreased white matter (WM) volumes in bilateral cerebellum_9 and left cerebellum;   (C)   MSA-c presented decreased rCBF in the bilateral cerebellum_4_5 and vermis_4_5.

Subsequent analyses revealed the close correlations among structure, perfusion, and function in patients with MSA-c or MSA-p type. Then, we found significant negative correlations between the UMSARS scores and structure changes in patients with both MSA-c and MSA-p type. Finally, according to the ROC analysis, we found the rCBF value of bilateral cerebellum_4_5/vermis_4_5 could be used as a sensitive biomarker to differentiate MSA-c from patients with MSA-p, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 79.2%. These findings may improve the understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of different types of MSA from the perspective of perfusion-structure-function coupling. \n\n\n### Differences in Structure, rCBF, and Function Between the Patients With MSA-c and MSA-p \n  \nThe cerebellum plays an important role in sensorimotor circuits, which receives information from the spinal cord, trigeminal nerve, vestibule, cerebral cortex, parietal tectum, and sends it to the motor-related regions to regulate movement (Timmann and Daum,  ). As we knew from the cerebello-cortical circuit, the afferent fibers of the cerebellum form the middle and lower cerebellar peduncles, transferring information mainly from the opposite cerebello-pontine nucleus and the inferior olivary nucleus to the neocerebellum and the efferent fibers of the cerebellum form the main body of the superior cerebellar peduncles, sending information from the neocerebellum to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex. From the view of this process, many cerebella subregions played important roles in the sensorimotor network, which were responsible for the balance, planning, and coordination of motor functions. Early studies believed that the main function of the cerebellum was motor control (Andermann et al.,  ; Takagi et al.,  ). In recent years, many neuroanatomies, neuroimaging, and clinical studies have shown that different subregions of the cerebellum and vermis participate in the different functions, including learning, cognition, emotions, and behaviors (Strick et al.,  ; Gruol et al.,  ; Reeber et al.,  ). \n\nIn this study, we observed significant structure atrophy and decreased rCBF in several cerebellum and vermis subregions in patients with MSA-c type relative to patients with MSA-p type. Typical histopathological findings of MSA-c type have been observed predominantly in the cerebellum. Structurally, a recent study revealed the disrupted structural atrophy in the cerebellum of the MSA-c type, including GM loss and WM degeneration (Dash et al.,  ), which was consistent with the current study. Interestingly, we found that the brain areas with reduced perfusion overlapped most of the brain areas with structural atrophy, indicating that decreased perfusion may contribute to the structural impairment in patients with MSA. Specifically, the decreased perfusion of patients with MSA-c type may disrupt the vascular clearance ability, which promotes accumulation of alpha synuclein-positive GCIs and generate neurotoxic matter, finally leading to neurodegeneration of cerebellum (Brettschneider et al.,  ). Therefore, we speculated that the vascular dysfunction of the cerebellum caused by disrupted perfusion might lead to the abnormalities of structure in the patients with MSA-c type. Compared to the patients with MSA-p type, the structure atrophy and reduced perfusion of the cerebellum and vermis subregions were more prominent in patients with MSA-c type, which were consistent with the clinical main symptom of cerebellar ataxia of the MSA-c type disease. \n\nIn the present study, we found decreased ALFF in the right LG/FFG in patients with MSA-c type relative to patients with MSA-p. The LG/FFG, as visual association cortex, were responsible for making visual associations, episodic memory consolidation, processing visual imagery, and verbal declarative memory (Bremner et al.,  ; Malhi et al.,  ; Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Tao et al.,  ; Kukolja et al.,  ). Previous studies have shown that visual and memory participated in regulating sensory and motor function (Dault et al.,  ; Cheng et al.,  ; Ramachandran and Altschuler,  ; Sayenko et al.,  ; Anguera et al.,  ; Seidler and Carson,  ; Fisher et al.,  ). In one of the previous studies, we also found functional changes in visual-related regions in patients with MSA-c type relative to healthy controls (Zheng et al.,  ). The direct comparison between the two MSA subtype groups suggested that the visual association cortex may be involved in regulating motor function and present significant ALFF differences in the two groups. The exact mechanism remains unclear. \n\n\n### Relationships Among Structure, Perfusion, Function, and Clinical Performances \n  \nA recent study revealed the coupling relationships between structure and function in the human brain (Baum et al.,  ). Another study assessed baseline associations among perfusion and brain structure using linear regression and found that greater whole-brain perfusion loss was associated with worsening brain structure in aging (Staffaroni et al.,  ). In a study combining ASL and fMRI, researchers found that functional brain hubs were identified primarily in the default-mode, insula, and visual regions, which showed striking spatial correlation with rCBF (Liang et al.,  ). These results revealed a close relationship among structure, rCBF, and brain function, which may be helpful to reveal the basic physiological mechanism of human brain interaction. \n\nIn this study, according to the correlation analyses among perfusion-structure-function coupling, we found positive correlations within the structure changes in patients with MSAc and MSA-p type separately. Additionally, we found positive correlations between the decreased rCBF and structure atrophy in patients with MSA-c type, which was consistent with the neurovascular coupling hypothesis (Kuschinsky,  ; Liang et al.,  ; Venkat et al.,  ), indicating that the rCBF changes may contribute to altered structure in the patients with MSA-c type. Besides, negative correlations between the decreased ALFF and structure atrophy in patients with MSA-c were found, which was consistent with the previous studies (Honey et al.,  ; Dacosta-Aguayo et al.,  ). Several studies explored the structure and function interaction and found that the coupling strength may be intrinsically a reflection of mental states (Wang et al.,  ; Huang and Ding,  ). In the current study, the negative correlations between structure and function suggest the plastic ability of the functional reorganization to resist the structural damage in patients with MSA. \n\nIn this study, we found close associations between clinical performances (UMSARS-I/UMSARS-II scores) and structure atrophy in several cerebellum and vermis subregions, suggesting clinical relevance of structural atrophy in different types of MSA. The altered structural atrophy in these regions might be used as imaging markers for tracking disease progression and classification. \n\n\n### The Biomarker to Differentiate the Two Groups \n  \nIn the previous study, several researchers used structure changes as biomarkers to differentiate the MSA-c type and healthy controls. For example, a previous study used the \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign as a biomarker to diagnose MSA-c type, yielding a high specificity of 97%, but its sensitivity was only 50% (Yekhlef et al.,  ). In the current study, we first employed the VBM, ASL, and ALFF analyses on different subtypes of patients with MSA, and then used different parameters to classify the two groups. Results showed that the rCBF of bilateral cerebellum_4_5/ vermis_4_5 could differentiate the two groups at relatively high accuracy, yielding the sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 79.2%, and the AUC value of 0.936. It could be used as a valuable imaging biomarker for the differentiation between patients of MSA-c and MSA-p type. \n\n\n\n## Future Considerations \n  \nFirst, in this study, we mainly focused on the motor function changes of MSA, as measured by UMSARS. Some patients with MSA might present cognitive dysfunction with the disease progresses. In the future, we will collect more subjects to evaluate cognitive performances. Second, in addition to the VBM protocol, the current evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases (NNDs) include the use of diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques that allow the assessment of more detailed microstructural architecture and parameters in brain tissue (Gatto et al.,  ,  ). We will add this imaging technique in the future work. Furthermore, it is more clinically meaningful to add the genetic and molecular biomarkers to help diagnosis MSA-c from MSA-p, and it is useful to make a more longitudinal and dynamic context, including adaptive and neuroplasticity mechanisms in the context of MSA and other NDDs (Gatto,  ), we will consider all relevant studies in the future work. Finally, the sample size is relatively small and the two sample size is imbalanced, in the future, a large sample of multimodal MRI data need to be collected to test the current findings and a longitudinal design including the pre-symptomatic patients (which is of great significance for the progress of MSA research) would be performed to elucidate the progressive changes of the different types of patients with MSA. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, by simultaneously applying VBM, ASL, and ALFF analysis to differentiate MSA-c from patients with MSA-p type, we observed significant structure atrophy and perfusion reduced in several cerebellum and vermis subregions and decreased ALFF in visual-related regions in patients with MSA-c type, compared to patients with MSA-p type. In addition, we found coupling relationships among perfusion, structure and function, as well as significant negative correlations between the UMSARS scores and structure atrophy in patients with MSA. Finally, we found the rCBF value of bilateral cerebellum_4_5/-vermis_4_5 could be used as a sensitive biomarker to differentiate MSA-c from MSA-p. These findings have important implications for understanding the underlying neurobiology of different types of MSA and added the new evidence for the disrupted rCBF, structure and function of MSA, which may provide the potential biomarker for accurately detecting different types of MSA and new ideas for the treatment of different types of MSA in the future. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because this data set involves the privacy of the subjects, so it is not convenient to share the data without the consent of the subjects.

Secondly, individual differences for both conditions were entered into paired group t-test analysis to rule out sub-threshold effects of sham stimulation, which showed stronger connectivity of the striatum nucleus with the right lateral occipital cortex and the cuneal cortex (max Z score 3.12) and with the right anterior temporal lobe (max Z score 3.42) and of the cerebellum with the right lateral occipital cortex and the right cerebellar cortex (max Z score 3.79). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur results suggest that effective AMPS acutely increases RSFC of brain regions involved in visuo-spatial and sensory-motor integration. \n\n\n## Classification of Evidence \n  \nThis study provides Class II evidence that automatic mechanical peripheral stimulation is effective in modulating brain functional connectivity of patients with Parkinson Disease at rest. \n\n\n## Trial Registration \n  \nClinical Trials.gov  \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPosture and gait disorders are among the most debilitating symptoms of Idiopatic Parkinson Disease. Particularly freezing of gait is defined as the inability to initiate gait or to manage narrow space- or direction-related challenges of gait, thus increasing the risk of falls [ , ] and reducing quality of life in Idiopatic Parkinson Disease patients [ ]. Particularly, functional Magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that freezing in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is related to dysfunction within fronto-parietal regions [ ], within the pre-supplementary motor area and the anterior insula in response to concurrent cognitive and motor tasks [ ], within fronto-parietal regions, basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus) and the mesencephalic locomotor region during performing a virtual reality task [ ]. Moreover, gait imagery tasks have shown decreased activity in the supplementary motor area and increased activity in the mesencephalic locomotor region in PD patients with freezing, as compared to those without freezing [ , ]. The executive attention network and the visual network connectivity has been found to be significantly different in PD patients with freezing as compared to PD patients without freezing and controls [ ]. Thus, there is currently strong evidence that alterations of the peripheral afferent inputs and/or their central processing alterations (i.e. sensory-motor integration) influence motor disability in patients with PD [ ,  ]. \n\nResting state functional MRI is currently widely used to study spontaneous fluctuations of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal while the patient is at rest [ ], thus also fitting for people who are unable or have difficulty in performing functional tasks [ ]. High temporal coherence of the spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuation among different brain areas is interpreted as a measure of functional connectivity between those areas and has led to the identification of brain functional networks [ ]. Analysis of functional brain networks and related connectivity measures has been obtained to explain non-motor [ \u2013 ] and motor [ ,  \u2013 ] deficits and to define their neural correlates in PD. These studies have shown alterations of brain connectivity in early-stage drug-na\u00efve PD patients [ ,  ] and in patients at advanced stage of the disease with cognitive [ ] and severe motor [ ] impairments. \n\nTo date, the effects of rehabilitation and exercise on brain activity have been poorly explored in patients with PD, but fMRI is considered of value to measure the effects of rehabilitation strategies in PD [ ]. \n\nIt has been reported that mechanical stimulation of the soles of the feet improves gait performance in PD [ \u2013 ]. Quantitative measures of gait analysis parameters have shown to increase step length and gait velocity together with autonomic sympathetic modulation in PD patients 24h after automatic mechanical peripheral stimulation (AMPS) [ ]. More recently, PD patients have shown improvement of their ability to perform the Timed Up and Go Test after AMPS [ ] and clinical benefits are maintained up to 10 days after the last treatment [ ]. \n\nThus, AMPS is emerging as a new and promising technique to improve posture and gait symptoms in PD, but mechanisms or neural correlates underlying its effects are currently unknown. The modulation of brain activity after AMPS has never been investigated. The aim of this work was to investigate whether and which measurable RSFC changes exist after AMPS in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson Disease. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statements and study outcomes \n  \nThe study was approved by the ethical committee of the Institute for Research and Medical Care, IRCCS San Raffaele, Rome, Italy ( ;  ). The experimental protocol was designed as a double-blind sham-controlled crossover pilot trial to test the acute modulation of brain functional connectivity in PD patients after AMPS ( ) (  ID: NCT01815281; see  ). All procedures were explained, adequate understanding was tested and written informed consent was obtained from the participants in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. Data were collected in compliance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and following the ALCOA (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original and Accurate) algorithm. The TREND checklist was accomplished ( ). \n\nThe primary outcome of the study was to detect changes of brain functional connectivity after AMPS in patients with PD. \n   Flowchart of the experimental protocol of the pilot interventional study as approved by the local ethical committee.    \n\n### Patients and clinical assessment \n  \nFrom September 15th to October 30th 2013, we investigated 11 patients (6 women and 5 men) with a diagnosis of PD according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s disease Society Brain Bank. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age of 45 years or older; 2) a Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage equal or less than 3.0 in an ON state; 3) subjects able to walk autonomously or with minimal assistance for a distance of 10 meters in OFF state (12 h without antiparkinsonian treatment); 4) antiparkinsonian treatment at a stable and optimized daily dosage during the 4 weeks prior to the study; 5) absence of dopaminergic long-lasting residual effects. Exclusion criteria were: 1) Dementia established on the basis of the Mini-Mental State examination (corrected score < 27); 2) history or presence of peripheral sensory neuropathy; 3) any peripheral neurological or musculoskeletal conditions that may alter balance and/or gait; 4) lower limb injuries in the previous 6 months; 5) history of neurosurgery or orthopaedic surgery; 6) history of epilepsy; 7) any drug treatment that may alter cognitive and/or motor performance; 8) history of depression or other psychiatric disorders; 9) absolute contraindications for MRI; 10) evidence of small vessel ischemic disease or suggestive findings of secondary parkinsonism on morphological MRI images. \n\nPatients underwent brain MR examination as outpatients and received clinical examination in a dedicated room beside the MRI magnet site. All patients were scanned twice in the same morning (between 8.30 am and 12.00 am), immediately before and < 30 min after sham or effective AMPS. Before and after each scanning session, motor performance was measured outside the scanner according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (III) score by an experienced neurologist (G.S. or M.F.D.) who was blinded to the patients\u2019 treatment status. To avoid potential residual effect between stimulations, the sham and the effective trial on the same patient were conducted with a time delay of at least 15 days. Patients were randomly selected to first undergo either effective AMPS (n = 6) or sham (n = 5) stimulation. All data were collected in OFF state (after a 12h withdrawal of anti-Parkinson medication). Motor severity was assessed by using the motor subscale of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS part III). \n\n\n### Automatic Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation Treatment \n  \nEffective and sham Automatic Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation (AMPS) trials were conducted by means of a dedicated electro-medical device (Gondola Medical Technologies SA, Switzerland) ( ). The system consists in feet supports (left and right) ( ) with electrical motors that activate metallic stimulators having a rounded 2 mm tip; the motor-activated stimulators apply a mechanical pressure in two specific areas of each foot. The AMPS treatment consists in the application of a pressure via rounded stimulation tips in the four areas to be stimulated (two in each foot, corresponding to the head of the big toe and at the first metatarsal joint\u2013 ). The pressure is applied in a range of 0.3\u20130.9 N/mm  in each point, one after the other; the pressure of stimulation, within said range, is set for each subject upon appearance\u2013during application of the stimulus\u2013of the monosynaptic reflex in the Tibialis Anterior muscle, identified by detection of a liminaris contraction. Once the pressure value has been set using this procedure, the value is recorded to administer the AMPS. The treatment consists in 4 cycles, whereas cycle means the sequential stimulation of the 4 target areas for the duration of 6 seconds each, with no intervals in between; consequently a single cycle has duration of 24 seconds, while the overall treatment including four cycles lasts 96 seconds. The trials were conducted in an isolated room to keep the treatment blind to the clinicians and neuro-radiologists involved in the study [ ]. \n   The device used for the AMPS treatment (a), the sites of feet stimulation (b), the effective AMPS (c), and the sham stimulation (d).    \nThe sham stimulation was provided using the same device utilized to give effective AMPS, with the same stimulation protocol and therapy cycle, applying in the same pressure stimulation points using the same steel stick for the AMPS stimulation. However, attached in the steel stick point was positioned a rigid plastic circle with a diameter (12mm); thanks to this, the induced pressure was hence lower and the surface contact bigger ( ). Sham stimulation does not trigger the reflex withdrawal of the stimulated foot and was used to eliminate confounding effects of brain activation induced by peripheral but not effective stimulation. No other procedures were conducted due to the full compliance of the patients to the interventions. We did not report any adverse event or unintended effect in each of the study conditions. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nImaging data were acquired using a Siemens 1.5-T MAGNETOM Avanto (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) whole body scanner equipped with a 12-element designed Head Matrix coil, as part of the standard system configuration. A morphological 3D-MPRAGE T1 weighted sequence was acquired to improve registration of functional images: TR = 1900ms, TE = 3.37ms, TI = 1100ms, flip angle = 15\u00b0, FOV = 256mm\u00d7192mm, NEX = 1, matrix = 256\u00d7192, 1.00\u00d71.00 mm  in-plane resolution, horizontal slices with slice thickness of 1.3 mm and no gap. Axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2 weighted scan was used to exclude the presence of small vessel ischemic disease and other supra- or infra-tentorial brain lesions: TR 8000 ms, TE 102 ms, TI 3650 ms, matrix 256 x 256, FOV 26 x 30 cm, slice thickness 3 mm. \n\nWhole brain functional scans were acquired in 25 contiguous axial slices approximately parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure plane with interleaved multi-slice T2* echo-planar imaging according to the following parameters: TR = 3.56 ms, TE = 50 ms, field of view = 22 cm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, voxel size = 3.4 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 3 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, no inter-slice gap. For each participant, a total of 80 volumes during 4.50 min were acquired. fMRI scanning was carried out in darkness, and the participants were explicitly instructed to relax, think of nothing in particular, not to fall asleep and stay as much still as possible with their eyes closed. At the end of the MR examination, all participants were asked about their feelings during the scan and the tendency to sleep during the scanning. None of the subjects fell asleep or reported significant feelings during the scans. \n\n\n### Data Pre-Processing and functional connectivity analysis \n  \nSingle-subject preprocessing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), Version 6.00, part of FSL v 5.0.4 (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library  ). Prestatistical processing consisted of motion correction using MCFLIRT [ ], brain extraction using BET [ ] and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. Large signal drifts (due to scanner instabilities or systemic physiological fluctuations) were attenuated by applying a high-pass filtering cut-off, set at 150 seconds [ \u2013 ]. Registration to high resolution structural and/or standard space images was carried out using FLIRT [ ,  ]. EPI volumes were registered to the individual\u2019s structural scan using FLIRT_BBR (Boundary-Based Registration) tool [ ]. Registration from high resolution structural to standard space was then further refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration [ ,  ]. \n\nResting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis was carried out using a seed-ROI based approach [ ,  \u2013 ]. Based on previous evidence of local functional alterations of resting state fMRI measurements in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients [ ], we explored the changes of functional connectivity with the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory-motor cortices (as on the FSL implemented Harvard-Oxford Cortical Structural Atlas) [ ], cerebellum (as on the MNI Structural Atlas), and basal ganglia (left and right nucleus striatum or left and right globus pallidus or left and right thalamus) [ ]. Regions of Interest (ROIs) positioned on these areas were used as the seeds for resting state functional connectivity. Basal ganglia ROIs were labeled and calculated from each subject\u2019s high resolution T1-weighted structural scan using FMRIB\u2019s integrated registration and segmentation tool (FIRST) [ ], part of FSL. To be more restrictive in ROIs segmentation, we chose an arbitrary inclusion threshold of 30% for the primary sensory-motor cortices and cerebellum, and of only 5% for the SMA (in an attempt to include both SMA proper and pre-SMA components, known to be altered from resting state studies conducted on patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease) [ ,  ]. An expert neuroradiologist (CCQ) visually inspected the chosen ROIs in order to validate anatomical correspondence. EPI-to-standard registration parameters were inverted and used to report all seed-ROIs to individual subject space, applying both linear and non-linear transformation matrices from standard and high resolution space. Mean BOLD time series of each native space seed-ROI were obtained and used to define the reference time course, after which a correlation analysis between each reference time course and the signal time series in each voxel within the acquired whole-brain image set was computed. \n\nSeeds of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and white matter (WM) were also individually defined in the lateral ventricles and in the centrum semi-ovale on the functional EPI images, and their time courses were added, as non-interest covariate (nuisance), into the voxel-wise correlation analyses, to remove for non-neural contributions to the BOLD signal and enhance specificity [ ]. \n\nAnalyses were conducted both without and with inclusion of 6 head motion parameters into the voxel-wise correlation analysis to control for effects of transient head motion of patients on our results [ ]. \n\nZ-score functional connectivity (FC) maps were generated for each subject by displaying all those voxels whose time series were correlated with the seed region (p<0.05). Maps of individual FC differences for pre- and post-effective AMPS (treatment) and pre- and post-sham conditions were initially obtained and entered in respective higher-level one-sample t-test analyses using FEAT (cluster level p<0.05 corrected for family wise error\u2014FWE) to investigate for the mean effect of PMS and sham conditions on FC, separately. Then, a second higher-level analysis was conducted performing a paired T-test between maps of individual FC differences in effective and sham conditions. Higher level analyses were carried out using the FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) mixed-effects model, stage 1 [ \u2013 ]. Z-statistic images were set using clusters determined by Z>2.3 and a corrected cluster significance threshold of p < 0.05 [ ]. Anatomical localization of significant clusters was established according to the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases and the Juelich Histological Atlas included in the FSL ( ). Clinical scores before an after sham or effective AMPS were tested with the Wilcoxon-signed rank test for paired data by means of the SPSS software package 19.0. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Patients \n  \nThe 11 patients enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to a sham or effective AMPS according to the cross-over design ( ). Patients showed a clinical akinesia/rigidity subtype in 72% (8/11) while a tremor subtype was present in the remaining 28% (3/11) of the patients. All the patients were right-handed and at least 12 h OFF medication. Demographic and clinical parameters are presented in   ( ). The clinical evaluation before and after experimental sessions showed a statistically significant improvement of the UPDRS III scale (p < 0.001) after effective AMPS but not after sham stimulation (p = 0.87). The total Postural Instability Gait Disturbances (PIGD) UPDRS sub-score significantly improved after effective AMPS both with and without the inclusion of the 3.11 (freezing) score. However, the tremor and the rigidity sub-scores were not affected by effective AMPS. Sham stimulation did not induce significant modifications in any of the clinical measures. ( ) \n   Demographic and clinical parameters of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease before and after effective AMPS and sham stimulation.        \nAmong the 11 patients, 7 (4 female, 3 men) were included for fMRI analyses of resting state functional connectivity. The exclusion of four participants was necessary because of the following reasons: one patient showed a large arachnoid cyst that caused anatomical distortion; three patients had at least one fMRI session with movement artefacts that significantly flawed data pre-processing and impeded intra- and inter-subject correction and registration. The 7 patients included in the fMRI study showed a clinical akinesia/rigidity subtype in 86% (6/7) while a tremor subtype was present in the remaining 14% (1/7) of the patients. In this subgroup of patients included for resting state functional connectivity, the effective AMPS consistently improved the UPDRS III score and the PIGD sub-score (with or without freezing) whereas there were not significant changes of the tremor and rigidity sub-scores. \n\n\n### Changes of Functional Connectivity in the Resting State \n  \nOne sample t-test analyses showed significant (p<0.05, FWE corrected) differences of RSFC with the selected seed regions following effective AMPS but not on sham conditions. Group differences were always oriented toward a significant increase of connectivity. Reduction of connectivity was not found with any of the seed regions. The primary sensory-motor cortex showed significantly stronger connectivity with the left superior parietal lobule and the left lateral occipital cortex (superior division) (t-tests) (  and  ). The second higher level analysis to test the specific changes induced by the effective stimulation after ruling out sub-threshold effects of sham stimulation did not show significant changes of connectivity (mixed model). \n   Z-statistic images showing clusters of significantly increased RSFC (p < 0.05, cluster-level FWE corrected) after one session of effective AMPS of the primary sensory motor cortex (a), the nuclei striati (c) and the cerebellum (d), overlaid onto a MNI-registered anatomical 3D-T1 volume.  \nSeed regions of interest are red-coloured in the panels on the left.

The second higher level analysis confirmed significant increase of connectivity of the nucleus striatum with the right lateral occipital cortex and the cuneal cortex (  and  ) (mixed model). Moreover, both t-test and the mixed model showed increased functional connectivity at rest between the nuclei striati and the right temporal pole (Tables   and  , Figs   and  ). \n   Z-statistic images showing clusters of significantly increased RSFC (p < 0.05, cluster-level FWE corrected) in the effective AMPS vs. sham stimulation for the nuclei striati (a) and the cerebellum (b).  \nSeed regions of interest are red-coloured in the panels on the left.

The second level analysis confirmed significantly higher connectivity induced by the effective stimulation with the right cerebellar cortex crus I (i.e. intraregional connectivity) and the right lateral occipital cortex (  and  ). \n\nA further analysis that comprised the cerebellum subregions vermis, right hemisphere and left hemisphere confirmed increase of functional connectivity both with first-level (t-tests) and second-level (mixed model) analyses after effective stimulation. Vermis showed increase of connectivity with the left lateral occipital cortex and the left fusiform gyrus. Left and right cerebellar hemisphere considered separately both showed increase of connectivity with the right lateral occipital cortex and the right cerebellum crus I (  and  ). \n   Z-statistic images showing clusters of significantly increased RSFC (p < 0.05, cluster-level FWE corrected) after one session of effective AMPS and in the effective vs. sham stimulation for the right cerebellar hemisphere (a), the left cerebellar hemisphere (b) and the vermis (c).

Due to their established role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson Disease, we chose the sensory-motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum as \u201cseeds\u201d to investigate effects on the brain functional connectivity at rest [ ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nOur results indicate that the pressure controlled mechanical stimulation on two specific points of both feet increases brain functional connectivity at rest with the selected regions and that the effect is stable with the nucleus striatum and the cerebellum after inclusion of sub-threshold not significant effects following sham stimulation. The recruitment of a constellation of specific brain regions and the enhancement of their functional connectivity dynamics might be the basis for the acute improvement of posture and gait symptoms observed in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients after effective AMPS [ ]. \n\n### Primary Sensory-Motor Cortex Functional Connectivity \n  \nEffective AMPS acutely induced consistent increase of at rest functional connectivity of the primary sensory-motor cortices with the left superior parietal lobule and the left lateral occipital cortex. These areas are known to be involved in sensory-motor and visuo-spatial integration and processing [ ]. Particularly, the left primary motor cortex, the left pre-SMA and the left superior parietal lobule have shown significantly convergent difference of neural activity in Parkinson\u2019s Disease OFF patients against healthy controls on a recent meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies on the motor control of Parkinson\u2019s Disease [ ]. In this respect, as compared with inconsistency on the direction of differences of other fronto-parietal areas, the left SPL consistently shows increased BOLD signal as compared to controls during the execution of different externally specified motor-tasks conducted on Parkinson\u2019s Disease OFF patients, thus suggesting that SPL plays a compensatory role that is not dependent on the motor task in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients. Indeed, the increased functional connectivity that we observed after effective plantar stimulation also suggests that SPL activity may be modulated by external peripheral stimuli. It is striking that, together with SPL, also the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) showed a stronger functional connectivity after effective stimulation. The LOC plays a well-known role on object recognition [ \u2013 ], is included in the patterns of brain atrophy in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients with freezing of gait [ ] and, as such, the modulation of its connectivity after peripheral stimulation might support the hypothesis of a crucial role of parietal regions on visuo-spatial integration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease. \n\n\n### Basal Ganglia Functional Connectivity \n  \nAt the level of the basal ganglia, we observed a significant increase of RSFC of the nucleus striatum but not of the thalami and the globi pallidi after effective AMPS. The regions of increased coherence with the nucleus striatum comprised the right occipital fusiform gyrus and the right lateral occipital cortex. These areas are specialized to recognize places [ ], faces [ ] and objects [ ]. The putamen projects to the cortical motor areas, including the SMA, via the globus pallidus [ ]. In Parkinson\u2019s Disease, the dopamine uptake is reduced in the striatum and particularly in the putamen [ ]. The putamen has shown decreased regional homogeneity in patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease as compared to controls in the resting state [ ] and meta-analysis on functional neuroimaging data show that the putamen is indeed the nucleus whose decreased function consistently correlates with motor deficits in Parkinson\u2019s Disease OFF patients [ ]. The putamen is involved in the planning of self-initiated or self-paced movements [ ] and the anterior striatum is involved, together with pre-SMA, in the preparation and updating of plans of future actions that are under voluntary control [ ]. On this respect it is interesting that functional modulation after effective AMPS showed increased connectivity of the striatum with areas that are part of the ventral visual processing stream but not with brainstem-cerebellum or executive motor fronto-parietal areas as expected [ ,  ]. The nucleus striatum also showed a stable increase of functional connectivity after AMPS with the right temporal lobe, an area that is interchangeably named to indicate what is functionally known as anterior temporal lobe [ ]. The anterior temporal lobe\u2019s function has been explored in many studies from which one of the most recognized models is the so called \u201csemantic hub\u201d theory [ ]. On this basis the anterior temporal lobe could act as a multimodal semantic hub where information from different sensory (visual, somatosensory and auditory) modalities converges [ ]. In this context, the lateralization of the increased coherence consistently observed between the nucleus striatum and the right anterior temporal lobe rather than the left one would fit well with the emerging evidence that in conceptual knowledge the right anterior temporal lobe is specialized for visual recognition whereas the left one is specialized for the process of lexical access [ ,  ]. Previous studies have shown that: i. there is decreased fMRI activation of the visual pathway in Parkinson\u2019s Disease in the absence of clinically relevant visual symptoms [ ]; ii. patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease rely on visual cues to control locomotion [ ,  ]; iii. Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients with freezing of gait show reduced resting state connectivity at the right occipito-temporal gyrus in respect to Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients without freezing of gait [ ]. Thus, our results support the idea that visuo-spatial integration significantly impact on motor execution in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients and its function may be modulated by peripheral stimulation. Moreover, the lack of changes in the cortico-basal ganglia motor loop connectivity suggests that functional pathways different than those dependent on the dopaminergic system [ ,  ,  ] are modulated after AMPS. \n\n\n### Cerebellum Functional Connectivity \n  \nThe functional connectivity of the cerebellum increased after effective AMPS. The effect involved again the right occipital fusiform gyrus and the right lateral occipital cortex. The connectivity between primary motor, pre-motor, supplementary motor cortices and cerebellum has shown to be disrupted in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients compared to controls during performance of self-initiated movements. In that paper, Wu et al. also showed that, while striatum-cortical and striatum-cerebellar connections are weakened in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients, cortico-cerebellar connections are strengthened and may compensate for nigro-striatal dysfunction [ ]. We observed modulation of functional connectivity between the cerebellum and areas of the visual ventral processing system, thus suggesting that peripheral stimulation may have a facilitating effect on the function of compensatory areas. Moreover, the mixed model showed an intra-regional cerebellar increased connectivity with the right crus I that was confirmed even when left and right cerebellum hemispheres were separately tested as seed regions of interest. Clusters of significantly increased connectivity after stimulation were located at the level of the paravermal lobules, functionally known as part of the spino-cerebellum. The spino-cerebellum receives extensive sensory inputs from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and sends efferent fibers to the cerebellar deep nuclei to integrate sensory-motor information and allows anticipation of body position during movement in a feed-forward manner [ ]. Moreover, according to the somatotopic organization of the spino-cerebellum, the paravermal intermediate areas, as we observed, are involved in the control of legs and arms movements. \n\nThe cerebellum physiologically enters into action when preparing or executing movements [ ], and is also involved in generating accurate timing of self-paced movements [ ]. fMRI studies have consistently showed increased activation in the cerebellum of patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease OFF medication during the performance of motor tasks [ ] and in the resting state in patients with akinesia/rigidity [ ]. Analysis of connectivity based on the graph theory has shown increased connectivity degrees in the left cerebellum, together with the left premotor cortex and left parietal cortex in patients OFF medication, partially normalized by administration of levodopa [ ]. \n\nParkinson\u2019s Disease patients have shown recruitment of cerebellum activity to increase movement velocity as a mechanism of compensation for basal ganglia dysfunction [ \u2013 ]. However, the idea of a compensatory function of the cerebellum is still under debate and physiopathological mechanisms such as the inability to inhibit activity secondary to abnormal basal ganglia function cannot be ruled out [ \u2013 ]. Nevertheless, our observation of increased connectivity of the cerebellum supports the hypothesis of a cerebellar compensatory effect in Parkinson\u2019s Disease and that AMPS may facilitate these neural circuits. \n\n\n### Effective versus Sham Plantar Mechanical Stimulation \n  \nThe sham stimulation did not yield significant changes of functional connectivity with any of the chosen seed ROIs. However, to correct for any sub-threshold effects induced by sham stimulation, we performed direct comparisons of functional connectivity in the effective and sham conditions using a repeated-measures mixed-effects model. We found a stronger level of connectivity with the nuclei striati and the cerebellum, but not with the sensory motor cortex, the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia. Particularly, the functional connectivity of the nuclei striati was significantly stronger with the right lateral occipital cortex and with the right temporal pole while the cerebellum showed stronger connectivity intra-regionally in the right crus I and again with the right lateral occipital cortex. These latter findings reflect the net result of connectivity changes after effective stimulation. This analysis confirmed intra-regional functional coupling in the paravermal cerebellum and between the cerebellum and the ventral visual processing, especially the lateral occipital complex. \n\nMoreover, the nuclei striati showed consistent functional coupling with the same areas discussed above and, following AMPS, stronger connectivity was found between the nuclei striati and the cuneal cortex, which is also known to be involved in visual processing. \n\n\n### Interpretational Issues \n  \nThe main limitation of the present pilot study is the small number of subjects included, further restricted for the fMRI analyses. However, the results of first-level (datasets number = 14) and second-level (datasets number = 28) analyses were consistent and were confirmed with and without inclusion of 6 head motion parameters in the analysis. In the current study we explored functional connectivity with a seed-ROI based approach using the brain regions known to be the most involved in Parkinson Disease physiopathology as seeds. However, a data driven approach is needed to obtain information on functional brain networks without a priori hypotheses. Moreover, false negative results may have occurred in this study and trials conducted on large groups of patients are necessary to fully understand the complex effects of peripheral stimulation on brain functional connectivity at rest. \n\nDespite our seed ROIs were bilateral, significant differences of functional connectivity showed lateralization to the left side for the cerebellum vermis and the primary sensory motor cortex and to the right side for the nucleus striatum and cerebellum hemispheres. In the case of the visual ventral pathway, the lateralization may be explained by the well-known right hemisphere predominance of visuospatial skills in the human brain [ ]. As it regards the right lateralization of the effect in the cerebellum, we currently have not an unequivocal explanation: 1. the right side of the cerebellum is strongly connected with the contralateral left sensory-motor pathway and its function could be preferentially modulated by the plantar stimulation in this group of right-handed patients; 2. lack of changes on the left side of the cerebellum could be a false negative result due to the small size of the sample; 3. other mechanisms of cerebellar functional asymmetry may exist [ ]. \n\nIn the future, our investigation will be aimed to increase the sample size of Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients undergoing AMPS and to explore the effects of the peripheral stimulation on healthy control subjects. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our results showed a consistent effect of AMPS on increasing resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of brain regions involved in visuo-spatial integration and processing, in sensory-motor integration and anticipation of body position during movements. These effects are associated with improvement of the ability to initiate voluntary movements of the lower limbs in Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients OFF medication, thus suggesting that AMPS may have a role in rehabilitative protocols by facilitating brain compensatory pathways to manage symptoms such as akinesia. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4607499, "text_md5": "51c2e790ae40f944bc09c867e3c2b251", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 235], "journal": [236, 244], "publication_year": [246, 250], "title": [261, 385], "keywords": [399, 399], "abstract": [412, 2349], "body": [2358, 38902]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26469868, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0137977", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4607499", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4607499"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4607499\">4607499</a>", "list_title": "PMC4607499  Acute Modulation of Brain Connectivity in Parkinson Disease after Automatic Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation: A Pilot Study"}

Diffusion MRI data were acquired from patients with Parkinson disease (n = 105, of whom 34 were low visual performers and 19 were hallucinators) and age-matched controls (n = 35). We used whole-brain fixel-based analysis to compare microstructural differences in fiber density (FD), macrostructural differences in fiber bundle cross section (FC), and the combined FD and FC (FDC) metric across all white matter fixels. We then performed a tract-of-interest analysis comparing the most sensitive FDC metric across 11 tracts within the visual system. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nPatients with Parkinson disease hallucinations exhibited macrostructural changes (reduced FC) within the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left posterior thalamic radiation compared to patients without hallucinations. While there were no significant changes in FD, we found large reductions in the combined FDC metric in Parkinson hallucinators within the splenium (>50% reduction compared to nonhallucinators). Patients with Parkinson disease and low visual performance showed widespread microstructural and macrostructural changes within the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral posterior thalamic radiations, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe demonstrate specific white matter tract degeneration affecting posterior thalamic tracts in patients with Parkinson disease with hallucinations and low visual performance, providing direct mechanistic support for attentional models of visual hallucinations. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nDementia is common in PD over the age of 65 years,  but it is impossible to determine which patients will develop cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis.  One recognized risk factor is the occurrence of visual hallucinations (VH).  Similarly, visual processing abnormalities are associated with higher risk: poor color vision is linked to Parkinson dementia,  and impaired visual performance correlates with poor cognition at the 1-year follow-up.  The neural substrates of hallucinations and visual dysfunction therefore provide important insights into early Parkinson dementia. \n\nAxonal involvement occurs early in PD. Dystrophic axonal changes precede neuronal loss ; exogenous \u03b1-synuclein in neuronal cultures triggers endogenous pathology within axons ; and in mouse mutant models, axonal pathology develops before neurite loss.  Techniques sensitive to axonal changes such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are most likely to detect early cognitive involvement in PD. DWI studies show white matter changes in patients with PD without dementia without gray matter atrophy ; these are worse in patients with poorer cognition  and established dementia.  However, the imaging changes accompanying or preceding the earliest stages of Parkinson dementia are not fully established. \n\nFixel-based analysis is a novel framework providing metrics particularly sensitive to white matter microstructural and macrostructural changes. We used this technique to measure fiber-specific changes in patients with PD vs controls, PD/VH vs PD/non-VH, and patients with PD with poor visual performance vs those with PD with maintained performance. We hypothesized that white matter atrophy would be present in patients with PD with hallucinations and visual dysfunction, who are at risk of dementia. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nWe recruited 105 patients with PD to our UK center. All patients satisfied the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria for PD.  Thirty-five unaffected controls were recruited from spouses and volunteer databases. \n\nPatients with PD were classified as habitual visual hallucinators (PD/VH) if they scored \u22651 on question 2 of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; \u201cOver the past week have you seen, heard, smelled or felt things that were not really there?\u201d). Nineteen patients answered positively to this question (PD/VH) and 86 did not (PD/non-VH). Further details on the experienced hallucinatory phenomena were collected with the University of Miami Parkinson's Disease Hallucinations Questionnaire, which quantifies hallucination severity and frequency (maximum score 14). \n\nThe patients with PD were also classified into high visual performers (n = 70) and low visual performers (n = 34) on the basis of performance on 2 visual computer tasks (Cats-and-Dogs task and Biological Motion task). Details of stimulus generation and experimental procedures have been described previously  (example stimuli are available from Figshare, supplemental figure 1,  ). For both tasks, performance was measured in terms of discrimination sensitivity; participants who performed worse than the group median performance on both tasks were classified as low visual performers. One participant with PD was unable to successfully complete both visual tasks and was excluded from analysis. \n\n\n### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents \n  \nThe study was approved by the Queen Square ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent before taking part. \n\n\n### Clinical assessments \n  \nAssessment of motor function was performed with the UPDRS. General cognition was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). All participants had an MoCA score \u226526, above the cutoff for Parkinson dementia of the Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was defined as impaired performance on at least 2 neuropsychological tests according to Movement Disorder Society criteria. All participants underwent ophthalmology assessment, including optical coherence tomography, by an ophthalmologist. Participants with significant ophthalmic disease that could lead to concurrent Charles Bonnet syndrome and those with other neurologic disorders were excluded. Visual acuity was evaluated with LogMAR. Color vision was assessed with the D15 and contrast sensitivity with the Pelli-Robson test. Sniffin' Sticks were used to test olfaction. Mood was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and sleep with the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire. Levodopa dose equivalence scores were calculated for participants with PD. \n\n\n### MRI data acquisition \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner (Siemens, Munich, Germany) with a 64-channel head coil. DWI was acquired with the following parameters: b = 50 s/mm /17 directions, b = 300 s/mm /8 directions, b = 1,000 s/mm /64 directions, b = 2,000 s/mm /64 directions, 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u2013mm isotropic voxels, echo time 3,260 milliseconds, repetition time 58 milliseconds, 72 slices, 2-mm thickness, and acceleration factor of 2. Acquisition time for DWI was \u224810 minutes. A 3D magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo image (voxel size 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm, echo time 3.34 milliseconds, repetition time 2,530 milliseconds, flip angle 7\u00b0) was also obtained and was used to compute intracranial volume with SPM12. \n\n\n### DWI prepossessing \n  \nDWIs underwent denoising,  removal of Gibbs ringing artifacts,  eddy-current and motion correction,  and bias field correction.  To increase anatomic contrast and to improve statistics, we upsampled the DWI spatial resolution of DWIs to a voxel size of 1.3 mm  and performed intensity normalization across participants.  All preprocessing steps were performed with MRtrix3 ( ). \n\nNext, we calculated fiber orientation distributions (FODs) for each participant via Multi-Shell Multi-Tissue Constrained Spherical Deconvolution using the group average response function for each of the 3 tissue types (gray matter, white matter, and CSF).  An unbiased, study-specific FOD template was created using FOD images from 30 randomly selected participants (20 with PD: 10 low and 10 high visual performers, 10 healthy controls) in accordance with previous studies.  Each participant\u2019s FOD image was then registered to the template using FOD-guided nonlinear registration.  A tractogram with 20 million streamlines was generated with whole-brain probabilistic tractography on the population FOD template. This was then filtered to 2 million streamlines using spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms. \n\n\n### Fixel-based analysis \n  \nClassic diffusion tensor imaging approaches have limited ability to model crossing fibers.  This limits their fiber specificity, especially in regions containing crossing fibers, which includes up to 90% of the white matter voxels in the brain.  Fixel-based analysis is an emerging framework that uses a higher-order diffusion model to estimate the orientation of each fiber population and to quantify degenerative changes in specific fiber populations within voxels. This allows comparisons of specific fiber populations within voxels (or fixels) instead of comparing measures averaged across voxels. \n\nUsing fixel-based analysis allows the characterization of more specific white matter tracts and provides information on their morphology and density. Detailed methodology of fixel-based analysis and interpretation of the derived measures have been previously described.  Three measures were derived for each participant:   \nFiber density (FD) or apparent FD. FD is sensitive to alterations in within-voxel level. FD is calculated as the integral of the FOD of each fixel and is proportional to the intra-axonal volume of fiber bundles aligned with that fixel. The FD is therefore a measure of microstructural changes within the tracts. \n  \nFiber cross-section (FC). This is a relative metric of differences in bundle cross section. Values >1 compared to the template imply larger cross section in that participant, and lower values suggest atrophy of a tract.  FC is calculated as the extent of distortion in bundle cross section that is required to warp a participant\u2019s FOD into the template image. This metric is a measure of macrostructural white matter change; it provides morphologic information about relative sizes of fiber bundles. \n  \nCombined measure of FD and FC (FDC). Changes to a tract may be both macrostructural, with reduced FC, and within voxel, with lower FD in that fiber. This is captured by the FDC metric, which is calculated as FD multiplied by FC for each fixel and represents a combined measure of change at both the microstructural and macrostructural levels or, in other words, an overall measure of ability to relay information. \n  \n\nThe processing steps for whole brain fixel-based analysis used in this study are shown in  . \n   Overview of the processing steps involved in FBA and VBA whole-brain analyses  \n(A) Processing steps for fixel-based analysis (FBA) and voxel-based analysis (VBA).

DWI = diffusion-weighted imaging; FA = Fractional anisotropy; FC = fiber cross-section; FD = fiber density; FDC = fiber density and cross section combined; FOD = fiber orientation distribution; MD = mean diffusivity. \n  \n\n### Voxel-based analysis \n  \nTo compare the results of fiber-specific fixel-based analysis with more commonly used measures of white matter integrity, we also performed a voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Following the DWI preprocessing steps, we derived the diffusion tensor from each participant\u2019s FOD image and calculated an FA and MD map in each participant\u2019s space. Each individual participant\u2019s FA and MD maps were then transformed to template space, using the same warp generated during the fixel-based analysis registration step. We then performed voxel-wise analysis in template space ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Demographic and clinical assessments \n  \nDifferences in demographics and clinical characteristics between groups were examined with independent-sample   t   tests and analyses of variance for normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests for nonnormally distributed ones, and \u03c7  for categorical variables. Visual inspection of variable distribution and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used to assess normality. Post hoc corrections for multiple comparisons were performed with the Tukey test for analysis of variance and the Nemeyni test for Kruskal-Wallis. Statistical significance was set at   p   < 0.05. All statistical analysis was performed in Python 3 with Jupyter Notebook version 5.5.0. \n\n\n#### Whole-brain fixel-based analysis \n  \nWe used whole-brain fixel-based analyses to identify regions with changes in FC, FD, and FDC between patients with PD and controls, patients with PD/VH and PD/non-VH, and patients with PD with high vs low visual performance. Additional comparisons of interest included Parkinson MCI vs Parkinson non-MCI and correlation with MoCA and 2 clinical dementia risk scores.  Subgroup analysis in patients with PD and low visual performance included hallucinators vs nonhallucinators. Whole-brain fixel-based analysis refers to the comparison of all white matter fixels within the brain, as is standard for this analysis.  Statistical comparisons of the 3 fixel-based analysis\u2013derived measures between groups were performed at each fixel level with a general linear model with age and total intracranial volume included as nuisance covariates. We used connectivity-based fixel enhancement for statistical inference,  using 2 million streamlines with default smoothing parameters (smoothing millimeter full width at half-maximum, C = 0.5, E = 2, H = 3), 5,000 permutations using nonparametric permutation testing, and family-wise error correction for multiple-comparison corrections; values of   p   < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\n\n#### Whole-brain voxel-based analysis \n  \nVoxel-based analysis was performed with threshold-free cluster enhancement with default parameters (dh = 0.1, E = 0.5, H = 2)  across the whole brain as in the fixel-based analysis for the same comparisons: patients with PD vs controls, patients with PD/VH vs PD/non-VH, and patients with PD with high vs low visual performance. Age and total intracranial volume were included as nuisance covariates; family-wise error correction was used, and values of   p   < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\n\n#### Tract-of-interest analysis \n  \nTo investigate potential degeneration of selective fiber pathways within the visual system, we also performed tract-of-interest analyses. On the basis of an a priori hypothesis that tracts from visual processing regions to the rest of the brain would be affected, we selected 11 white matter tracts involved in visual processing, using anatomic diffusion tensor imaging atlases,  and computed the average FDC across the fixels of each defined tract. These tracts were the posterior thalamic and optic radiations, splenium, body and genu of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (segmentation includes the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), and superior fronto-occipital fasciculi. Mean FDC was calculated across each tract per participant. FDC was chosen for tract-of-interest analysis because it is a combined metric of both microstructural and macrostructural changes representing the overall ability to relay information, and hence it is likely to be the most sensitive of the 3 fixel-based analysis\u2013derived metrics. This is in accordance with other fixel-based analysis studies.  Mean FDC was compared across groups: PD vs control, PD/VH vs PD/non-VH, and PD high performers vs PD low performers. Statistical comparison was performed with a linear mixed model (with age and intracranial volume as covariates) in Python 3. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed for the 11 tracts tested using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Correlational analyses of mean tract FDC with hallucination severity were performed with linear regression with age and total intracranial volume as covariates. A significance threshold of 0.05 was used. We display mean FDC results (and 95% confidence interval) as percentage difference from the mean FDC of the comparison group. \n\n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nAnonymized data will be shared on request from any qualified investigator for purposes of replicating procedures and results. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics: VH vs non-VH \n  \nOne hundred forty participants were included: 105 patients with PD and 35 controls. Nineteen patients described recurrent VH (PD/VH) and 86 did not (PD/non-VH). Participants with PD/VH and PD/non-VH did not significantly differ in demographics or low-level vision. Those with PD/VH had higher total UPDRS score (  p   = 0.003,  ), but motor handicap was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Participants with PD/VH had higher anxiety scores than those with PD/non-VH (  p   = 0.037), but this was below the threshold for diagnosis of anxiety.  Of note, age, sex, intracranial volume, cognition, and performance in the visual experimental tasks did not differ significantly between the groups ( ). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of participants with PD/VH and PH/non-VH \n  \n\n### Demographic and clinical characteristics: High vs low performers on visual testing \n  \nThirty-four participants with PD were low performers and 70 were high performers on visual testing. Age, sex, intracranial volume, and cognitive measures did not differ between low and high performers with PD. Low performers with PD had worse contrast sensitivity (  p   < 0.001,  ) and a higher propensity for hallucinations (  p   = 0.041), with 29.4% being habitual hallucinators ( ). Depression scores were higher in the PD low performer group, but they were below the threshold for depression  ( ). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of participants with PD with low and high performance on high-order visual tasks \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the control participants are available at Figshare ( ). \n\n\n### Fixel-based analysis \n  \n#### Patients with PD vs controls \n  \nWhole-brain fixel-based analysis comparing participants with PD and controls showed macrostructural white matter changes with reduced FC in multiple fixels within the left corticospinal tract (data available at Figshare,  ). There were no differences at the microstructural level, measured as FD or the combined metric FDC, between patients with PD and control participants. Within the PD group, overall disease severity, as assessed with the UPDRS total score, was associated with decreased FC within the splenium of the corpus callosum (data available at Figshare). \n\n\n#### White matter atrophy in PD/VH \n  \nPatients with PD/VH showed white matter macrostructural changes, with reductions in FC within the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left optic radiation, compared with nonhallucinators. The combined FDC metric, which assesses microstructural and macrostructural white matter changes, showed large reductions (>50% reduction) in participants with PD/VH compared with PD/non-VH within the splenium ( ). There were no significant changes in FD alone. \n   Fiber tract\u2013specific reductions in PD/VH compared to PD/non-VH from whole-brain fixel-based analysis  \n Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with visual hallucinations (VH) vs patients with PD/non-VH. Patients with PD/VH showed changes in white matter macrostructure (as seen by reduction in fiber cross section [FC]) and the overall ability to relay information (as defined by reduction in the combined FC/fiber density [FDC] metric) compared to patients with PD/non-VH. Reduced FC and FDC are seen in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left optic radiation in PD/VH. Percentage reduction in FC and FDC is shown (color bar reflects percentage reduction) (family-wise error [FWE]\u2013corrected   p   < 0.05). (B  )   PD/VH vs PD/non-VH, direction of fibers. Loss of fiber tracts in PD/VH compared with PD/non-VH was seen particularly for left-right axons (color bar reflects direction of fiber loss: anterior-posterior, green; superior-inferior, blue; left-right, red) (FWE-corrected   p   < 0.05). \n  \n\n#### Changes in white matter microstructure and morphology related to low visual performance in PD \n  \nPatients with PD and low visual performance showed significant microstructural changes, with reductions in FD in multiple white matter tracts. Specifically, reductions were seen within the splenium of the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic and optic radiations bilaterally, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, with peak reductions (greater than 50% reductions) in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Macrostructural changes, measured with FC, were found within the genu of the corpus callosum. The combined FDC metric showed significant reductions in the genu, splenium, bilateral thalamic radiations, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in low performers compared to high performers with PD ( ). They were particularly pronounced within the corpus callosum (genu and splenium) with >50% reductions in FDC. \n   Fiber tract-specific reductions in PD low performers compared to PD high performers from whole-brain fixel-based analysis  \nPatients with Parkinson disease (PD) and low visual performance showed macrostructural (changes in fiber cross section [FC]) and microstructural changes (changes in fiber density [FD]). Microstructural changes are seen within the splenium of the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations bilaterally, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Macrostructural changes are seen within the corpus callosum. Changes in the combined FD/FC (FDC) metric are seen in the genu, splenium, bilateral thalamic radiations, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; this represents impaired overall ability to relay information in these tracts in PD low performers. Results are displayed as streamlines; these correspond to fixels that significantly differed between PD low performers and PD high performers (family-wise error\u2013corrected   p   < 0.05). Streamlines are colored by percentage reduction in the PD low performers group compared to high performers for FD, FC, and FDC. \n  \nSubgroup analysis within the group of PD low performers was performed to assess whether the findings were driven by the hallucinator subgroup. We found no significant differences in FC, FD, or FDC between PD low performers with hallucinations and without hallucinations. \n\nWhite matter changes were not seen for measures of general cognition or dementia risk. MoCA, status of MCI, and 2 clinical dementia risk scores  were not associated with any significant white matter changes at the microstructural or macrostructural level, suggesting that visual performance is more strongly linked to structural changes in the predementia state in PD. \n\n\n\n### Voxel-based analysis \n  \nConventional voxel-based analysis of FA and MD did not show any statistically significant differences between any of the tested groups: PD vs controls, PD high performers vs PD low performers, and PD/VH vs PD non VH. \n\n\n### Tract-of-interest analysis \n  \n#### FDC changes in patients with PD \n  \nIn tract-of-interest analysis, we saw increased mean FDC in patients with PD compared to controls in the genu of the corpus callosum (  t   = 3.135,   p   = 0.002) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (  t   = 2.336,   p   = 0.019). The genu survived FDR correction for multiple comparisons (  p   = 0.016). There were no significant differences between patients with PD and controls in the remaining 9 tracts. \n\n\n#### FDC changes associated with VH \n  \nWe saw widespread reductions in mean FDC in PD/VH compared to PD/non-VH in a tract-of-interest analysis. Specifically, changes were seen in the splenium, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, the posterior thalamic radiation bilaterally, and the superior longitudinal fasciculus on the right ( ). The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi bilaterally survived FDR correction for the regions tested (right   p   = 0.033, left   p   = 0.033), as did both posterior thalamic radiations (right   p   = 0.033, left   p   = 0.037), the genu (  p   = 0.037), and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (  p   = 0.033) ( ). Including cognition (MoCA score) as a covariate in the analysis did not influence results, indicating that the observed white matter changes are independent of cognitive performance. \n  \nFDC in 11 tracts of interest across groups of patients with PD \n     Significant tracts in patients with PD/VH and PD low performers; tract-of-interest analysis  \n(A) Reduction (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI]) in combined fiber density and cross-section (FDC) visualized as percentage reduction from the mean of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) without hallucinations (PD/non-VH). The posterior thalamic radiations bilaterally, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi bilaterally, genu, and right superior longitudinal fasciculi survived false discovery rate (FDR) correction. (B) Reduction (mean, 95% CI) in FDC visualized as percentage reduction from the mean of patients with PD with high visual performance. Note that only the genu survived FDR correction. Tracts with significantly reduced FDC (  p   < 0.05) are shown in color; tracts where there are no significant changes in FDC are plotted in gray. (C) Anatomic representation of all analyzed tracts. \n  \nHigher hallucination severity, determined by University of Miami Hallucinations Questionnaire, was associated with lower mean FDC within the left posterior thalamic radiation, accounting for age and total intracranial volume, although this was just above statistical significance levels (  r   = 0.316,   df   = 101,   t   = \u22121.955,   p   = 0.053). \n\n\n#### FDC changes in PD low performers \n  \nThere were widespread reductions in mean FDC in PD low visual performers compared to PD high performers across the visual system. Specifically, FDC reductions were seen in the splenium, the genu, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi bilaterally, the posterior thalamic radiations bilaterally, and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus ( ), with the genu surviving FDR correction for the regions tested (  p   = 0.011) ( ). Again, controlling for MoCA scores had no influence on the reported results. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nHere, we have used fixel-based analysis to measure fiber-specific changes in patients with PD/VH and those with poor visual function to shed light on the early stages of cognitive impairment in PD. We found that patients with PD/VH exhibited axonal reduction within the splenium and left posterior thalamic radiation and that low visual performance in PD was associated with changes in the splenium and genu of the corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings provide evidence that visual changes in PD are associated with microstructural and microstructural changes within specific fiber pathways that have been functionally implicated in PD dementia. \n\nOur finding of white matter changes in posterior thalamic projections is consistent with previous work using tensor-derived metrics that showed reduced FA in the optic nerve and optic radiation in an analysis of 5 manually determined regions of interest  and increased MD within tracts from the nucleus basalis of Meynert to parietal and occipital regions in patients with PD/VH.  In contrast, past whole-brain tensor-based analyses had not revealed any specific white matter changes between PD/VH and PD/non-VH.  We found widespread reductions in FC, as well as the FDC metric, suggesting that white matter macrostructural changes occur in Parkinson hallucinations together with changes that affect the ability to relay information between brain regions. \n\nThe posterior thalamic radiation connects the posterior thalamus with the occipital and posterior parietal cortex, including key regions of the default mode network (DMN) such as the posterior cingulate. Several functional studies have highlighted the role of attentional networks in the development of VH.  Our finding of reduced connectivity from the thalamus to posterior brain regions, including the DMN, provides a mechanistic model whereby lack of inhibition between these brain regions leads to aberrant DMN activation. \n\nIn tract-of-interest analysis, we also saw FDC reductions within association fibers in PD hallucinators, specifically those connecting frontal and occipital lobes (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi bilaterally and right superior longitudinal fasciculus). This highlights the importance of loss of fronto-occipital connectivity in the development of hallucinations. \n\nThe patients with PD/VH had higher anxiety and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire scores than the nonhallucinators. However, anxiety scores were below the clinical significant threshold for depression,  and the small observed changes in anxiety and RBD are unlikely to have resulted in white matter changes within tracts of the visual system. \n\nWe found widespread changes in FD in patients with PD and poor visual function, particularly in the splenium, bilateral posterior thalamic projections, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. This is in comparison to a reduction in FC, reflecting fiber atrophy, that was restricted to the genu of the corpus callosum. The most pronounced changes in patients with PD and low visual performance, in both spread and effect, were seen in the combined FDC metric. This overall connectivity metric combines density and morphology information, is thought to reflect differences in the ability to relay information between brain regions,  and was most reduced within the genu in PD low performers in whole-brain and tract-of-interest analysis. Disconnection of frontal interhemispheric processing may be linked to poor visual performance and has previously been implicated in worse visual search performance in healthy aging.  In tract-of-interest analysis, the genu of the corpus callosum showed increased mean FDC in patients with PD compared to age-matched controls; this could be a result of heterogeneity within patients with PD. \n\nChanges within the corpus callosum have previously been described using tensor-derived metrics in patients with PD and cognitive impairment in both whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses, with changes being particularly pronounced in the most anterior and most posterior segments.  We also found significant microstructural and macrostructural changes within the genu and the splenium of the corpus callosum in patients with PD and low visual performance. There is growing evidence that visuoperceptual deficits are an early indicator of PD dementia,  and we have previously shown that visuoperceptual deficits are linked to cognitive decline after 1 year.  By examining the differences in white matter connectivity in patients with PD and low visual performance and using a novel, more sensitive technique, we have highlighted additional white matter tracts that are affected in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment. \n\nOur results are also in keeping with other neuroimaging studies highlighting the importance of connectivity changes in early cognitive impairment of PD. Changes in functional connectivity between visuospatial and frontal regions  and between the posterior cingulate with frontal regions  are seen in patients with PD and early cognitive impairment. We have also shown changes within the left fronto-occipital fasciculus, an association tract thought to play a role in executive function, semantic language, and visual processing.  Measures of global connectivity are also reduced in patients with PD and cognitive impairment compared to those without in both functional and structural imaging data.  Diffuse changes in white matter tracts in patients with PD and poor visual performance were also demonstrated in our study, consistent with reduction in global connectivity. \n\nSubgroup analysis within patients with PD with low visual performance did not show any significant differences between those with low visual performance and hallucinations and those with low visual performance without hallucinations. This indicates that the affected white matter tracts are associated only with poor visual performance and are not driven by the hallucinator subgroup. In addition, clinical risk scores for dementia, MCI status, and MoCA were not associated with white matter loss, suggesting that measures of high-level visual function may be more sensitive than standard global measures to detect early cognitive change in PD. \n\nNo significant changes were seen in FA or MD between patients with PD with low vs high visual performance or in hallucinators vs nonhallucinators. Because tensor-based metrics are, by definition, averaged across a voxel, their results can be misleading, particularly in the presence of crossing fibers.  In contrast, our fixel-based analyses identified group differences in fiber microstructure and macrostructure. This suggests that high-order diffusion models and specifically fixel-based analysis may be more sensitive and specific for examining white matter changes in the early stages of neurodegeneration. \n\nThe white matter tracts that were most affected in the PD low performers included areas that connect key regions of the DMN. The genu of the corpus callosum contributes to homotopic connections between prefrontal brain regions. Thus structural changes within the genu could lead to functional disconnection of the anterior medial prefrontal cortex.  Similarly, the splenium connects association areas of the posterior inferior parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.  The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus connects medial and inferior frontal gyri to occipital gyri but also angular, fusiform, and lingual gyri and the cuneus.  Although observed functional connectivity is not fully explained by direct structural white matter connectivity, changes within anatomic white matter tracts could predict resulting changes in functional connectivity.  Our findings are consistent with previous studies using functional metrics that have suggested that DMN activation is reduced in PD, with loss of connectivity correlated with worse cognition. \n\nThere are a number of potential limitations to our study. We did not exclude participants with other pathologies that could influence white matter structure such as white matter hyperintensities, which could decrease FD. Although raw imaging data were visually inspected and no clinically significant cerebrovascular disease was seen, the load of white matter hyperintensities was not systemically quantified or specifically controlled for. This is in keeping with other studies of fixel-based analysis in adults so far, none of which excluded participants with white matter hyperintensities.  Future studies could clarify the effect, if any, of white matter hyperintensities on fixel-based metrics. \n\nOur participants underwent imaging acquisition while taking their usual dopaminergic medications. It seems unlikely that dopaminergic medications would directly affect structural integrity measures, and free water and corrected FA are not affected by levodopa medication. \n\nFinally, the current study examines cross-sectional data, and longitudinal studies examining white matter changes in patients with visual deficits who progress to dementia are likely to provide useful insights into the earliest fibers affected in patients with PD who go on to develop dementia. \n\nWe show that patients with PD/VH have a characteristic pattern of fiber tract degeneration, involving the splenium and posterior thalamic radiation, and that patients with PD and poor visual function show widespread changes in FD, especially in the splenium, posterior thalamic radiations, genu, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings provide mechanistic support for attentional network changes in Parkinson hallucinations and insights into early stages of cognitive involvement in PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7251523, "text_md5": "1b3f012993fb9d9d58b046322c7977e2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 119], "journal": [120, 129], "publication_year": [131, 135], "title": [146, 235], "keywords": [249, 249], "abstract": [262, 2171], "body": [2180, 36797]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32094242, "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000009014", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251523", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7251523"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251523\">7251523</a>", "list_title": "PMC7251523  Fiber-specific white matter reductions in Parkinson hallucinations and visual dysfunction"}

To date, no disease modifying treatment for PD exists. Here, the study protocol of the Dutch Parkinson Cohort (DUPARC) is described. DUPARC is a longitudinal cohort study aimed at deeply phenotyping de novo PD patients who are treatment-na\u00efve at baseline, to discover and validate biomarkers for PD progression, subtypes and pathophysiology. \n\n\n## Methods/design \n  \nDUPARC is a prospective cohort study in which 150 de novo PD subjects will be recruited through a collaborative network of PD treating neurologists in the northern part of the Netherlands (Parkinson Platform Northern Netherlands, PPNN). Participants will receive follow-up assessments after 1\u2009year and 3\u2009years, with the intention of an extended follow-up with 3\u2009year intervals. Subjects are extensively characterized to primarily assess objectives within three major domains of PD: cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision. This includes brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); brain cholinergic PET-imaging with fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV-PET); brain dopaminergic PET-imaging with fluorodopa (FDOPA-PET); detailed neuropsychological assessments, covering all cognitive domains; gut microbiome composition; intestinal wall permeability; optical coherence tomography (OCT); genotyping; motor and non-motor symptoms; overall clinical status and lifestyle factors, including a dietary assessment; storage of blood and feces for additional analyses of inflammation and metabolic parameters. Since the start of the inclusion, at the end of 2017, over 100 PD subjects with a confirmed dopaminergic deficit on FDOPA-PET have been included. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDUPARC is the first study to combine data within, but not limited to, the non-motor domains of cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision in PD subjects over time. As a de novo PD cohort, with treatment na\u00efve subjects at baseline, DUPARC provides a unique opportunity for biomarker discovery and validation without the possible confounding influences of dopaminergic medication. \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \n; registered retrospectively, November 28th 2019. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting up to 1 in 100 adults over the age of 60 [ ]. Despite its large societal impact, the cause of PD remains elusive and only symptomatic treatments exists that mainly targets the motor symptomatology. In addition, the clinical diagnosis of PD poses a clear diagnostic challenge and is rejected in 20% of the cases [ ,  ]. Though PD is clinically defined by motor symptoms resulting from dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, non-motor symptoms are present in the majority of cases and often precede the motor symptoms by years [ ]. The constellation of both motor and non-motor symptoms greatly differs between PD subjects, making PD a heterogeneous disorder in which different clinical subtypes might represent different etiologies [ ,  ]. \n\nTo advance our understanding of PD pathophysiology and move towards disease modifying treatments, it is essential to investigate PD as broad as possible, taking into account its large clinical heterogeneity. For this purpose, extensive clinical characterization and biomarker assessments are required for adequate classification of PD subtypes and associated prognostic and pathophysiological markers. Ideally, studies designed to discover and validate biomarkers in PD should only include treatment-na\u00efve PD subjects at baseline, to avoid the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic medication. However, such study cohorts are sparsely available. \n\nThis paper describes the study protocol of the DUtch PARkinson Cohort (DUPARC), a single-center, prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort study at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) of de novo PD subjects, who are treatment-na\u00efve at baseline. PD participants are extensively characterized with the aim to discover and validate biomarkers for PD subtypes, progression and pathophysiology. Though the endpoints assessed in the DUPARC study allow for subject characterization across a wide variety of domains, DUPARC focuses on three domains in particular, representing the interests and expertise of our research group: (1) cognition, (2) gastrointestinal function and (3) vision. \n\n### Cognition \n  \nCognitive dysfunction is a common non-motor symptom in PD that greatly influences the quality of life of patients. Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is already present in 25\u201330% of newly diagnosed patients and is considered an important risk factor for the development of PD dementia [ ,  ]. The cognitive profile in PD is highly heterogeneous, with multiple cognitive domains affected. \n\nThe underlying pathology of cognitive impairment in PD is complex and includes the degeneration of multiple neurotransmitter systems, of which the cholinergic system is thought to be of particular importance [ \u2013 ]. In vivo cholinergic imaging studies revealed cholinergic deficits in PD patients compared to control subjects, with the cholinergic loss being even more pronounced in PD patients with dementia, suggesting a direct relationship between cholinergic denervation and cognitive decline in PD [ \u2013 ]. However, these findings are based on indirect Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with a tracer binding to acetylcholinesterase. Although acetylcholinesterase is considered to be a reliable target for cholinergic imaging, it is located both on pre- and postsynaptic membranes, and also binds postsynaptically on non-cholinergic neurons [ ,  ]. Recently, the selective PET tracer [ F]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) was introduced and validated [ ,  ]. This tracer binds presynaptically to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and is a more sensitive and regional cholinergic marker compared to the cholinesterase binding tracers [ ,  ]. \n\nCombining selective dopaminergic and cholinergic imaging with detailed neuropsychological assessment in a longitudinal cohort of de novo, treatment-na\u00efve PD patients, provides the opportunity to explore the exact role of the cholinergic system in specific cognitive domains, to identify sensitive biomarkers of cognitive decline, and explore future therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that (1) in newly diagnosed, treatment-na\u00efve PD patients, a significant proportion of patients will show cognitive impairment related to regional cortical and subcortical cholinergic denervation; (2) baseline regional cholinergic denervation will be a predictor of cognitive decline in PD over time. \n\n\n### Gastrointestinal function \n  \nGastrointestinal dysfunction, in particular constipation, is one of the earliest manifestations of PD and can occur up to 20\u2009years before diagnosis [ ]. In concordance with the symptomatology, alpha synuclein deposition in Lewy bodies and neurites, the pathological hallmark of PD, are also found in the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) of PD cases [ ,  ]. The alpha synucleinopathy is believed to spread in a prion-like manner via the vagal nerve to the brain [ ]. Moreover, intestinal inflammation and an increased intestinal wall permeability are found in PD [ ]. Possible determinants of the enteric pathology in PD include gut microbiota, which were found to modulate the synucleinopathy, neuroinflammation and motor symptomatology in a rodent PD model [ ]. \n\nRecently, 16 independent studies have shown that the gut microbiota composition of PD patients is significantly different from healthy age-matched controls (HC) [ ]. Interestingly, the gut microbiome changes in PD do not match those in idiopathic constipation, despite the high prevalence of constipation in PD [ ]. So far, published studies on gut microbiota composition in PD almost exclusively included dopamine-suppleted PD patients, which is a significant confounder. Moreover, subtype analyses within PD have been limited, in which PD subjects with autonomic dysfunction, indicative of a possible gut-first subtype, might be of particular interest [ ]. Therefore, to advance the development of gut microbiota composition as a biomarker or possible therapeutic target in PD, it is a requirement to establish the gut microbiota composition of extensively characterized treatment-na\u00efve PD patients. \n\nWe hypothesize that (1) gut microbiome composition of treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects is different from HC; (2) dopaminergic medication drives differential abundance of gut microbial taxa independent of PD progression; (3) PD subjects with autonomic dysfunction, indicative of a gut-first subtype, will show distinct gut microbial signatures compared to other PD subjects; (4) the gut microbiome changes in (constipated) PD subjects will be different from the changes in idiopathic constipation subjects; (5) the intestinal wall permeability will be increased already in de novo PD subjects with concomitant signs of intestinal inflammation. \n\n\n### Vision \n  \nPD presents with a broad range of visual system dysfunctions, including visual hallucinations and defects in color vision, contrast sensitivity and visual fields [ \u2013 ]. Along with visual symptoms, thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and is observed in PD, including thinning of the inner-plexiform and the ganglion cell layer [ ]. The pattern of retinal thinning and the peripheral visual defects in PD bear resemblance with glaucoma, a disorder with a pathophysiological and epidemiological link with PD [ ,  ]. Though retinal thinning has been suggested as possible biomarker for PD diagnosis, severity and progression [ ,  ], our understanding of the visual system in PD, and the possible link with pathologies such as glaucoma, is still limited. \n\nTwo studies have been published investigating the retina in de novo treatment-naive patients with OCT [ ,  ], and reported statistically significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer. In treated PD subjects, it has been shown that dopaminergic treatment and other interventions commonly applied in PD, such as deep brain stimulation, can alleviate some of the visual symptoms present in PD, but are also able to induce or worsen visual symptoms [ ]. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies incorporating the effect of dopaminergic treatment in PD. In order to understand the effects of PD on visual function and retinal structure, including the seemingly contradictory effects of PD medication, there is a need for an in-depth ophthalmological assessment in a longitudinal PD cohort, with data collection before and after treatment initiation. \n\nWe hypothesize that (1) de novo PD patients will show a specific pattern of retinal thinning, in particular affecting the inner plexiform layer; (2) the retinal thinning pattern of PD will be different from glaucoma, with retinal changes focusing on the inner plexiform layer in PD, contrary to the ganglion cell layer in glaucoma; (3) dopaminergic medication will increase the thickness of retinal cell layers, especially the inner plexiform layer; (4) the severity of retinal thinning will be a predictor of PD disease progression. \n\n\n\n## Methods/design \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThe DUPARC study is a single center, prospective, observational study of 150 de novo PD patients who are treatment na\u00efve at baseline with follow-up after 1 year and 3 years, with the intention of an extended follow-up with three-year intervals. DUPARC is designed to assess 16 specific objectives with a focus on the domains of cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision, with the overarching aim to discover and validate biomarkers for PD subtypes, progression and pathophysiology (Table\u00a0 ).\n   \nObjectives of the DUPARC cohort study \n  \n\n\n### Study population \n  \n#### In- and exclusion criteria \n  \nInclusion criteria consist of PD diagnosis by a movement disorders specialist according to Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD, with a confirmed dopaminergic deficit by means of an 3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ( F-FDOPA) PET scan. \n\nPD subjects who are unable to provide written informed consent, who are unable to comply with study procedures, who have exclusion criteria for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), who have gastrointestinal exclusion criteria influencing gut microbiome composition, or whose PD diagnosis is rectified during follow-up, are excluded from the study cohort. A detailed overview of the applicable in- and exclusion criteria is provided in Supplementary Table\u00a0 . \n\n\n#### Recruitment strategy \n  \nParticipants are recruited via Parkinson Platform Northern Netherlands (PPNN), a collaborative network of PD treating neurologists in 13 medical centers in the northern part of the Netherlands. PPNN serves a total of approximately 5000 PD patients, with an incidence of 400 newly diagnosed PD patient within this network. Treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects who are willing to participate are referred to the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) to assess the in- and exclusion criteria. After inclusion and completion of the baseline assessments, patients return to their treating neurologist to continue care as usual, including the start with dopaminergic treatment. \n\n\n#### Control cohorts \n  \nThough the complete DUPARC protocol solely concerns de novo PD subjects, there is ample opportunity to interpret the assessed endpoints relative to appropriate control cohorts. Primarily, age- and sex-matched control subjects are recruited separately to ensure identical assessment techniques for the neuropsychological, gastroenterological and ophthalmological assessments, representing the three main domains of the protocol. In addition, appropriate control subjects for the ophthalmological assessments, including HC and over 1000 glaucoma patients, are available under a different IRB-protocol in the UMCG. These all received the ophthalmological assessments, including retinal imaging, according to the UMCG standard operating procedures, using the same OCT machine, during overlapping periods, to ensure maximal compatibility with the DUPARC data. Complementary, the gut microbiome and genetic assessments will be compared to control subjects from LifeLines, a three generation, population-based cohort study concerning 167.000 participants from the same geographical area in the northern part of the Netherlands [ ]. Of these participants, biomaterials such as fecal samples and blood samples have been collected in two large subcohorts (  n  \u2009=\u20099.000 and   n  \u2009=\u20091.100) [ ,  ]. In addition, 38.000 LifeLines participants, of a total of 53.000 participants of whom genotype data is available, have received the same genome-wide genetic assessment using the Illumina GSA-MD chip. Genotype information will eventually become available for all 167.000 LifeLines participants. To ensure compatibility, the LifeLines standard operating procedures for the gut microbiome and genetic analyses are also used in DUPARC. Biomaterial from selected LifeLines participants can be reanalyzed to assess possible batch effects. Moreover, stool frequency and consistency has been assessed using the same stool diary in DUPARC and LifeLines, allowing for the identification of LifeLines subjects with idiopathic constipation. Lastly, a large proportion of endpoints, including the neuropsychological assessments, will be assessed using norm-rated tools that depict the performance of the patient as a percentile corrected for relevant demographics, such as age and level of education. \n\n\n\n### Study procedures \n  \nAt baseline, study procedures start at home with the collection of biomaterials for genetic screening and the completion of gastroenterological assessments and various other questionnaires. After the home assessments, participants visit the UMCG during 2 days for PET and MR-imaging, as well as a complete neuropsychological, ophthalmological and clinical assessment. An overview of the baseline assessments is depicted in Fig.\u00a0 .\n   \nBaseline recruitment and assessments from Q4 2017 to Q3 2020 of treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects through the collaborative network of PD treating neurologists Parkinson Platform Northern Netherlands (PPNN). 1.

After 1 year, participants are visited at home for a repeated gastroenterological, clinical and questionnaire assessment. During the three-year follow-ups the complete baseline assessments are repeated with the exception of the genetic and gastrointestinal assessments.

Data unfit for storage in the eCRF (eg. imaging and metagenomic data) are stored on local secured servers at the UMCG. The metadata are stored in the eCRF. Study monitoring will be performed by in-house study monitors of the UMCG. Depending on the type of data and associated privacy regulations, data from the DUPARC project will be made publicly available or will become available via the corresponding author, upon reasonable request. \n\n\n### Sample size \n  \nSince most objectives of the DUPARC cohort study concern a first assessment in treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects, a formal power calculation is hampered, as no adequate estimation of the expected effect sizes can be provided. However, the effect sizes previously reported in already treated PD subjects with longer disease duration are mostly expected to be larger than the effect sizes in our cohort. Therefore, a power calculation based on previous reports will provide us with a minimum number of participants to include, to assess the most important endpoints within the domains of cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision. \n\nThe primary objective related to the cognitive domain is to establish the relationship between cognitive impairment and pre-synaptic cholinergic degeneration in de novo PD patients. This will be analyzed using cholinergic PET-imaging with FEOBV in combination with neuropsychological assessments covering all cognitive domains, including complex attention, learning and memory, executive function, perceptual-motor function, language, and social cognition. Because of the novelty of FEOBV, previous research using FEOBV-PET in PD is limited. Significant results were found in a small group comparing PD and control subjects [ ]. Cross-sectional comparisons between PD subgroups have included between 15 and 79 PD patients, with significant results [ ]. The size of the DUPARC cognition data is therefore expected to be sufficient for group and sub-group analyses, as well as detailed correlational research on the specific cognitive domains. Because of the great heterogeneity at baseline in both cognitive performance and cortical cholinergic innervation in PD, such a large cohort is needed for correlational analyses [ ,  ]. \n\nThe main objective within the gastrointestinal function domain is the comparison of the gut microbiome composition with HC. Though a power calculation for metagenomic analyses is not possible, we think our sample size will be sufficient to do these analyses, because previous studies already reported significant differences with far smaller sample sizes varying between 10 and 72 included PD subjects. Only two treatment-na\u00efve subgroups of 12 and 39 PD subjects have been investigated in previous studies, reporting fewer taxonomic differences in the treatment-na\u00efve group, compared to already treated subjects. The DUPARC gut microbiome data therefore surpasses most PD gut microbiome studies in sample size, and is by far the largest treatment-na\u00efve dataset, allowing for more robust microbiome composition signatures and correction for confounders. \n\nRegarding the domain of vision, the most recent meta-analysis on OCT imaging in PD has reported overall mean effect sizes of 0.45 for several retinal cell layers, comparing HC to PD subjects [ ]. For a similar effect size, with an alpha of 0.05, and a two-tailed comparison of means, a sample size of 79 subjects for each group would be sufficient to achieve a power of 0.80. \n\nThe sample size of 150 participants therefore clearly surpasses the expected numbers needed to assess the primary objectives within the key domains of DUPARC. Nevertheless, a sample size of 150 participants is still necessary, as the anticipated effect sizes of various biomarkers in treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD subjects is expected to be lower, compared to treated PD subjects with longer disease duration. In addition, to find biomarkers indicative of PD subtypes, the PD sample not only has to provide both case and control samples for a subtype comparison, but also the intergroup differences are expected to be lower if PD subgroups are compared. Our sample size of 150 participants will most likely allow for binary and trinary subtype comparisons, given the aforementioned samples sizes required to distinguish PD from HC. Lastly, the sample size also needs to be larger than calculated to account for participants who will be lost to follow-up. For this purpose, 180 participants will be included at baseline to account for 30 drop-outs and non-PD cases, in order to ensure a sample size of 150 participants. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nRelevant statistical analyses will be performed dependent on the applicable objective as formulated in Table\u00a0 . Since the various endpoints within and between domains could be densely correlated, especially based on the hypothesis that PD characteristics aggregate within distinctive PD subtypes, the correlations of variables across domains will be assessed [ ]. Provided the extensiveness and complexity of the DUPARC dataset, advanced statistical techniques, including artificial intelligence, will be used for cross-domain analyses. \n\n\n### Ethics approval and consent to participate \n  \nDUPARC is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and national and international standards of GCP. Potential participants receive detailed written and oral information on the study procedures and all participants provide written informed consent. Ethical approval of the study protocols was obtained from the Medical Ethics Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen (METc UMCG). The DUPARC study protocol is registered at the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO) with trial registration number NL60540.042.17, whereas the microbiome study is registered separately with trial registration number NL61123.042.17. In addition, the study has been registered retrospectively on November 28th 2019 at  , with identifier  . \n\n\n### Study timetable \n  \nThe first visit of the first patient was performed in Q4 2017. Baseline inclusion is planned until Q3 2020, and is on schedule. The milestone of 100 included PD subjects with a confirmed dopaminergic deficit on FDOPA-PET was reached in Q3 2019. The first publications on the baseline data are expected in 2020, followed by the first follow-up data in 2023. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDUPARC will be the first study to assess a variety of biomarkers and associated endpoints, combining multiple important disease domains, including cognition, gastrointestinal function, vision, neuroimaging and motor performance, in a cohort of de novo PD subjects who are treatment na\u00efve at baseline. Therefore, DUPARC provides a unique opportunity for biomarker discovery. Complementary, DUPARC can be used to validate previous findings from existing cohort studies in a treatment-na\u00efve PD cohort. \n\nThere is a large need for early markers of PD, its subtypes and progression. First, disease-modifying interventions should ideally be implemented as soon as possible to slow down the course of the disease, highlighting the need for a more accurate diagnosis of PD in the early phases of the disease. Second, given the clinical and possible etiological heterogeneity of PD, adequate subject stratification is imperative to advance our understanding of the disease mechanisms and informs trial design for putative disease-modifying trials. Third, the development of disease-modifying therapies is hampered by the lack of a solid measurement of disease progression. DUPARC fulfills these needs, given the inclusion of early stage de novo PD subjects, and the long-term follow-up with extensive assessment of endpoints in a variety of non-motor and motor domains of PD. The included patients in DUPARC are therefore very suitable for disease-modifying trials. \n\nBiomarker discovery in PD should ideally be performed in treatment-na\u00efve PD patients at baseline, since this eliminates the possible confounding effects of dopaminergic medication that cannot adequately be corrected for in a case-control setting. Causative inferences can be summarized by three possible scenarios, in which the biomarker is either causative for PD, caused by PD or is a confounder. Therefore, biomarkers discovered in the DUPARC treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD cohort provide promising leads for replication and validation in relevant cohorts, and functional inquiry into the pathophysiological significance of the biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. Such validation studies might include PD cohorts enriched for a specific PD associated genotype (eg.   GBA1   mutations) or functional research on patient derived biomaterial by reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (eg. organ-on-a-chip, human intestinal organoids). \n\nAdditionally, DUPARC has an optimal design with its single center set-up and the extensive assessment of endpoints. Though participants are recruited from 13 medical centers, all study assessments are performed in the UMCG or at home by UMCG investigators, according to the same standard operating procedures. This allows for the combined analysis of endpoints across various domains, without possible confounding influences of interinstitutional and interrater variability. Next to addressing the objectives of DUPARC as formulated in Table\u00a0 , this cohort provides multiple opportunities to combine endpoints across various domains, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction and cholinergic denervation, which will further advance our understanding of the disease mechanisms of PD and its subtypes. \n\nLastly, DUPARC can be used to validate the findings of other cross-sectional or longitudinal PD cohorts. Since most cohort studies concern already treated patients or lower numbers of treatment- na\u00efve subjects, validation of their results is required to disentangle the putative confounding influence of dopaminergic medication from any PD related effects. A considerable overlap can be observed with other cohort studies such as the Personalized Parkinson Project and the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative, giving ample opportunity for cross-linking and validation of findings in our single-center study cohort of treatment-na\u00efve PD subjects. In addition, the relation of more extensively studied domains with relatively unique endpoints in DUPARC, such as retinal layer scanning and cholinergic denervation, can be assessed. \n\nIn conclusion, DUPARC provides a unique opportunity for biomarker discovery and validation for PD subtypes, progression and pathophysiology in a treatment-na\u00efve de novo PD cohort across multiple important disease domains. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7293131, "text_md5": "ff7dd107f23fe0970aec0586a443dcab", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 174], "journal": [175, 185], "publication_year": [187, 191], "title": [202, 449], "keywords": [463, 639], "abstract": [652, 2926], "body": [2935, 29720]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32534583, "doi": "10.1186/s12883-020-01811-3", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293131", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7293131"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293131\">7293131</a>", "list_title": "PMC7293131  Study protocol of the DUtch PARkinson Cohort (DUPARC): a prospective, observational study of de novo Parkinson\u2019s disease patients for the identification and validation of biomarkers for Parkinson\u2019s disease subtypes, progression and pathophysiology"}

Recruitment of \u03b1-synuclein to membranes is required for correct vesicle dynamics, while altered oligomerization at membranes can contribute to PD. We present a high-resolution structural model of \u03b1-synuclein in its oligomeric, membrane-bound state based on solution NMR and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) restraints. The obtained structures prove useful in explaining the consequences of well-known familial PD mutations and revealed a plausible mode-of-action for UCB0599, a drug designed to interfere with membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein showing disease-modifying potential. We expect this structural information to support future research furthering our understanding of \u03b1-synuclein\u2019s intricate functions. \n  \n\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is an intrinsically disordered protein whose functional ambivalence and protein structural plasticity are iconic. Coordinated protein recruitment ensures proper vesicle dynamics at the synaptic cleft, while deregulated oligomerization on cellular membranes contributes to cell damage and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Despite the protein\u2019s pathophysiological relevance, structural knowledge is limited. Here, we employ NMR spectroscopy and chemical cross-link mass spectrometry on  N/ N-labeled \u03b1S mixtures to provide for the first time high-resolution structural information of the membrane-bound oligomeric state of \u03b1S and demonstrate that in this state, \u03b1S samples a surprisingly small conformational space. Interestingly, the study locates familial Parkinson\u2019s disease mutants at the interface between individual \u03b1S monomers and reveals different oligomerization processes depending on whether oligomerization occurs on the same membrane surface (cis) or between \u03b1S initially attached to different membrane particles (trans). The explanatory power of the obtained high-resolution structural model is used to help determine the mode-of-actionof UCB0599. Here, it is shown that the ligand changes the ensemble of membrane-bound structures, which helps to explain the success this compound, currently being tested in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients in a phase 2 trial, has had in animal models of PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) plays a prominent role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Lewy body dementia ( ) by changing its oligomeric state and ultimately forming aggregates ( ). The toxic \u03b1S aggregates interact with the lipid bilayer of cells and have been shown to incorporate bilayer constituents and disrupt the bilayers themselves ( \u2013 ), Lewy bodies also to a large degree consist of \u03b1S and membranes ( ). In addition, binding of \u03b1S to the surface of membranes has been demonstrated to promote further aggregation in\u00a0vitro ( ,  ) and the mechanism of this aggregation has been investigated recently ( ), although a decrease of aggregation can also be observed ( ). However, regulated interaction with lipid membranes is crucial for the proper functionality (i.e., neuronal differentiation and apoptosis) ( ,  ) of \u03b1S, as it is involved in SNARE complex assembly ( ,  ). In addition, it regulates exocytosis by promoting dilation of vesicle fusion pores ( ). Thus, detailed knowledge about the structural properties of the various oligomeric states of \u03b1S at the membrane surface is highly desirable for an understanding of its biological role and to guide drug research which aims to modify \u03b1S aggregation behavior at the membrane ( ). \n\n\u03b1S has been shown to exist in different conformations depending on the environmental context ( ). Purified from mouse brain, it is a monomeric, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) ( ). In\u00a0vitro studies performed on recombinantly expressed \u03b1S with circular dichroism ( ) and small-angle X-ray scattering ( ) also show it to be an IDP. The technique delivering the richest data on IDPs is NMR ( ), and both in\u00a0vitro and in-cell\u00a0NMR experiments ( ) have demonstrated that monomeric \u03b1S in solution is mostly disordered. \n\nWhen studied in the context of membranes, monomeric \u03b1S adopts a predominantly \u03b1-helical structure. This has been demonstrated by circular dichroism, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer, electron paramagnetic resonance, and solid-state as well as solution NMR-based studies ( ,  ,  \u2013 ). High-resolution structures were obtained for \u03b1S bound to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or sodium lauroyl sarcosinate-based micelles, although the orientation of helices as well as the existence of several different states is still a matter of discussion ( \u2013 ). \n\nIn mature fibrils, much of the \u03b1S sequence adopts a \u03b2-sheet fold as shown by both cryogenic electron microscopy and solid-state NMR studies ( ,  ) with fibril growth including similar charge-based interactions as those observed for membrane binding ( ). Oligomer formation at the membrane has been studied by several different methods ( ,  ) and various different relative orientations of the \u03b1-helical structures have been proposed ( ,  ). In addition, some previous work has indicated that multimers assemble from dimers in\u00a0vivo, ( ) while other work has shown sequential accumulation of oligomers ( ). \n\nIn this study, we employ an integrated structural biology approach combining NMR spectroscopy and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) using differently isotope-labeled forms of \u03b1S to provide for the first time detailed structural information for \u03b1S oligomers formed at and bound to membrane vesicles. We show that the phase 2 compound UCB0599 modulates these oligomers and provides a plausible mode-of-action (MoA) for this new drug. \n\n## Results \n  \n### Determination of Oligomeric State Distribution. \n  \nHere, we used XL-MS to probe the structural characteristics of \u03b1S in different states: monomeric SDS-micelle bound, monomeric bicelle bound, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG) based liposome bound, and bicelle-aggregated. The oligomer distribution of \u03b1S on membrane surface mimics (POPG-liposomes or bicelle-derived aggregates) was determined by cross-linking the protein while it is bound to the respective membrane mimic using the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and detecting the oligomeric state by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) ( ). It should be noted that the experimental \u03b1S to membrane concentration ratios are expected to also occur in\u00a0vivo (see   for details). To confirm the oligomeric status seen in PAGE samples, a set of experiments was performed where the EDC cross-linked \u03b1S species were removed from the liposomes using a small-molecule compound to displace \u03b1S from POPG-based surfaces ( ). The protein was separated from these liposomes by subsequent ultracentrifugation, and monomeric species present in the sample were removed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the resultant supernatant. The soluble multimers obtained were subjected to intact-mass spectrometry ( ). Most importantly, monomer, dimer, and trimer masses were clearly detected ( ). From the observed \u201cladder\u201d structure of the different oligomeric bands, it can be concluded that \u03b1S aggregation on membrane surface mimics proceeds via a stepwise oligomerization mechanism (linear growth/propagation). \n  \nCross-linking of \u03b1-synuclein at the membrane.

At the   Top  , the two different peptides detected are indicated with their cross-linking positions as well as the detected peptide spectrum matches for each combination of isotopomers. The mass spectrum allowing for this distinction is shown below. \n  \n\n### Structural Probing of Membrane-Bound \u03b1S Using XL-MS. \n  \nIn a next step, structural investigations of liposome surface-bound \u03b1S were performed using differentially isotope-labeled ( N and  N) proteins similar to the methodology demonstrated in ref.\u00a0 , enabling the use of an experimental strategy illustrated in  . Here, the analysis of individual isotopomers ( N\u2013 N,  N\u2013 N,  N\u2013 N, and  N\u2013 N) allows for the discrimination of intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links. While intramolecular cross-links are exclusively observed for homoisotopomers ( N\u2013 N and  N\u2013 N), intermolecular cross-links can be found for both homo- ( N\u2013 N and  N\u2013 N) and hetero-isotopomeric ( N\u2013 N and  N\u2013 N) forms. The prototypical MS spectrum of a cross-linked peptide shown in   demonstrates that the different isotopomers can be resolved and discriminated by this approach. In order to facilitate data analysis, \u201ccrosslink-contact maps\u201d of \u03b1S were generated based on the number of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) found for specific cross-linked residue pairs in a similar fashion as published previously ( ). As this approach focuses on regions with high cross-link density, it reduces the risk of unspecific encounters between \u03b1S molecules contributing significantly to the analysis ( ).  \u00a0shows intramolecular contacts found for monomeric \u03b1S obtained for different membrane-bound states (liposome, SDS-micelle, monomeric bicelle-bound, and aggregates induced by bicelles). The majority of cross-links obtained for the various monomeric membrane-bound states of \u03b1S (a-c) are close to the diagonal and clustered at the N-terminus indicating relatively extended or slightly bent conformations. Intramolecular (homoisotopomeric) links obtained from dimer bands of \u03b1S bound to liposomes ( ) show an overall similar pattern as the monomer band, but are enriched in specific regions. In our statistical analysis of these maps, we see the similarity of the pattern in a low Cohen\u2019s d value, while the statistically significant change in the pattern is evaluated by the low   P   value ( ). In the dimer band, more cross-link PSMs are observed for segments (55\u201365) to (90\u2013105) and (30\u201340) to (90\u2013105), indicating the higher abundance of more compact \u03b1S structures in the liposome-bound dimeric state as compared to the monomeric state. Even higher abundancies of these links were found in the trimer bands ( ). In contrast, the intramolecular contact map for \u03b1S dimers obtained for the bicelle-aggregated state ( ) is largely comparable to the bicelle-bound monomeric state ( ), which differs in incubation time of the mix prior to cross-linking (  Methods  ). A detailed statistical (quantitative) comparison of the obtained cross-link maps was performed by adapting a bootstrap methodology and is detailed in\u00a0 . \n  \nCross-linking patterns in \u03b1-synuclein are sensitive to conditions used.\u00a0(  A  \u2013  D  ) Cross-links detected in the monomer-band of \u03b1S after incubation with various membrane mimics. The number of PSMs found in a four-residue window is indicated in the color scales. While some long-distance contacts (130\u201320) are observed in the liposome-bound monomer (  A  ) and medium distances (60\u201335) in bicelles (  C  ), SDS bound monomers do not show a significant amount of long-range interactions (  B  ). Both intra- and inter-molecular contacts were detected for the bound form from the dimer band of \u03b1S (  E   and   F  ). Interestingly, the intramolecular cross-linking pattern changed substantially between dimeric, bound \u03b1S (  E  ) and the monomeric state (  A  ) (statistical measures are available in  ). Intermolecular contacts detected indicate two main regions for dimer formation (60\u201315 and 95\u201360). Note that loop-links (cross-links within a single peptide fragment) were omitted in our analysis, thus no diagonal peaks are expected. Additionally, residues located in the segment 60\u201380 are not amenable to the cross-linking reagents used and therefore no cross-links are observed for these residues. (  G   and   H  ) When incubated with bicelles \u03b1S can form aggregates. These show dissimilar cross-linking patterns as compared to those on liposomes. Intramolecular contacts both in the monomer as well as the dimer bands (  D   and   G  ) were more plentiful and show fewer medium range contacts (95\u201360 and 95\u201335). Intermolecular contacts (  H  ), however, are less abundant and are changed drastically as compared to the liposome-bound dimer. \n  \n\n### Mapping of the Oligomerization Interface. \n  \nResidue-resolved information about intermolecular contacts and the interaction interface was obtained by analyzing the heteroisotopomeric  N\u2013 N peptide cross-links. For the liposome-bound dimer state intermolecular contacts are predominantly observed for regions (90\u2013100) to (50\u201365) as well as (55\u201365) to (10\u201315) and (40\u201350) to (25\u201335) ( ). These interaction regions coincide with regions containing several of the point mutations involved in early-onset parkinsonism and have been used for the design of small-molecule therapeutic compounds ( ,  ). The intermolecular interaction pattern of bicelle-aggregated \u03b1S is distinctly different ( \u00a0and\u00a0 ). Since the bicelle-bound form of \u03b1S is monomeric, aggregation necessarily proceeds via interbicelle interactions (trans) rather than between two \u03b1S proteins bound to the same surface as is the case in liposomes (cis). Thus, and most importantly, the cross-link data provide evidence for different oligomeric species resulting from aggregation caused by intermolecular interactions between \u03b1S molecules bound to the same vesicle (intraliposome/cis) or located on different vesicles (interbicelle/trans), respectively. \n\n\n### NMR-Based High-Resolution Structure of Membrane-Bound \u03b1S. \n  \nSignal assignment of \u03b1S was achieved for both the SDS-micelle (BMRB-ID 50996) and bicelle-bound states (BMRB-ID 51148) ( ). The similarity between SDS-bound secondary structure propensity (SSP) data and that obtained for the bicelle-bound state ( ) suggests that these structures are independent from membrane curvature and may serve as a valid model system for the membrane-bound state of \u03b1S. Due to its more favorable NMR relaxation properties, the SDS-bound state was selected for further structural characterization. NMR signal assignment of the membrane-mimic-bound state(s) in our conditions (323 K and pH = 5.5) revealed the existence of three \u03b1-helical segments largely comparable to the already reported SDS-micelle-bound state ( ). In this study, we employ different NMR experiments than used previously in order to provide a larger and more comprehensive NMR data set for structural characterization of membrane-bound \u03b1S. The previous NMR study ( ) largely relied on measurements of nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) and residual dipolar couplings. In our study, we significantly increased the number of long-range contact-dependent NMR observables and consequently the quantity of such experimental constraints in the structure calculation protocol. We employed paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) and interference (PRI) as these experiments have exquisite sensitivity and can probe even sparsely populated conformational substates ( ), in contrast to conventional PREs. While the previous NMR study only involved a single PRE measurement utilizing changes in intensity, we recorded PRE-rate profiles for three independent spin label positions ( ). Moreover, the involvement of two additional PRI datasets ( ) substantially improves the available data, as PRI experiments also provide angular constraints. The (PRE) relaxation rates obtained were not compatible with expected rates calculated from published data ( ) ( ), implying that additional compact conformational states must exist for \u03b1S. For the structure determination of these state(s), we adapted the well-established Xplor-NIH protein structure calculation protocol to incorporate PRE-derived distance and PRI-derived angular constraints (  Methods  ). Additionally, NMR protein backbone chemical shift data were converted into secondary structure constraints. In order to derive an unbiased set of representative structures, an extended chain representation was used as a starting point (for details, see   Methods  ). In  , \u03b1-carbon to \u03b1-carbon (CA-CA) rmsd-based clustering of the 10 best solutions together with representative structures of each cluster and variations within each cluster are shown. Interestingly, one of the solutions largely corresponds to the previously determined structure ( ) (cluster C in  ). Most importantly, however, the two other clusters of   comprise structures with a different relative orientation of the three \u03b1-helices. It is important to note that the detection of these compact states was only possible due to the substantially increased number of experimental (distance and angular) constraints and the measurement of PRI data as a sensitive probe for (globally) compacted states ( ) stemming from the strong distance dependency of PREs (r ). The quality of the obtained structures was assessed by back-calculation of PRE rates and comparison with experimental rates ( ). The structures were further corroborated by comparison with intramolecular cross-link maps. Specifically, the distance map obtained for cluster B ( ,   Right  ) shows shorter distances between the region around residue 80 to 100 and the N-terminus, which fits cross-links observed with SDS micelles ( ), while the calculated distance map for cluster A ( ,   Right  ) shows more similarity to the intramolecular pattern found for dimeric \u03b1S bound to liposomes ( \u00a0and\u00a0 ). A thorough and quantitative assessment was performed by applying the recently developed XLmap methodology ( ), an R package to visualize and score protein structure models based on sites of protein cross-linking. The calculated CMScores ( ) convincingly (and quantitatively) corroborate the qualitative fits between structure and experiment ( ). Taken together, the PRE and PRI experiments clearly demonstrate the presence of (at least) three conformational substates with slightly different compaction and relative orientations of \u03b1-helices. Structures within cluster C (and partly cluster B) are in good agreement with the previously determined SDS-micelle bound structure of \u03b1S ( ) and likely represent the dominant state on SDS surfaces and possibly monomers on liposomes. Cluster A, however, shows structural similarity to liposome-bound dimeric forms of \u03b1S (obtained from XL-MS data) and points to the relevance of these states for membrane-induced oligomerization processes. \n  \nThe PRE/PRI/SSP derived compact ensemble of \u03b1-synuclein shares features with the multimer forming ensemble at the membrane. (  Left  ) CA-CA rmsd clustering of the 10 lowest energy structures obtained from monomer calculations. Residues 101 to 140 are excluded from the analysis as they are not constrained by experimental data.

The color codes for the maximum distance in surface representations (  Middle  ) and the distances in contact maps (  Right  ) are indicated at the   Top   of each column (both given in [\u00c5]). \n  \n\n### Computational Modeling of Wild-Type \u03b1S Oligomers. \n  \nHigh-resolution models for \u03b1S dimers and higher oligomers were obtained using intermolecular XL-MS data ( ) within the Xplor-NIH structure calculation framework. Given the agreement of intramolecular XL-MS data obtained from liposome-bound \u03b1S with NMR data of SDS-bound monomer structures ( \u00a0and\u00a0 \u00a0and\u00a0 ), NMR structural constraints derived for the SDS-bound state were employed together with XL-MS intermolecular restraints in the calculation of the oligomers (the calculation protocol is outlined in  ). Ambiguous constraints were defined based on the experimental PSMs. Specifically, the following contacts were used in the calculation: [(57, 61)\u2013(96, 97), (10, 13)\u2013(57, 60), (28)\u2013(45)] (more details can be found in the   Methods   section). Possible structures of \u03b1S dimers were calculated assuming internal symmetry (two \u03b1S molecules with identical monomer structures in the dimer). This assumption was made as the overall conservation of cross-link patterns in dimers and trimers ( ) suggests largely similar 3D structures of the different oligomers thus pointing toward a propagation mechanism which progressively links more or less structurally equivalent \u03b1S monomers. Although cluster A ( ) best reproduces the intramolecular cross-links obtained from the liposome-bound dimeric form of \u03b1S, ( ) independent calculations were also performed using representative monomer structures of clusters A, B, and C ( ) as input. While the starting structures of monomer A and B are able to interconvert during the dimer structure calculation, the starting structure C\u2014which closely resembles the previously determined SDS-micelle\u2013bound state ( )\u2014is locked in its starting conformation and likely represents the most populated state. Importantly, the incorporation of the new intermolecular constraints did not change the monomer structures (A and B) and thus indicate that the SDS-bound compact monomers are largely preserved in liposome-bound oligomers. \n\nInterestingly, independent of the starting (monomer A or B) structure, only two consistent solutions for the dimer structure are found ( ). While both dimer structures share the same interaction interface between \u03b1S molecules, the relative orientation of different \u03b1S monomers in the dimer varies. This is illustrated in   by depicting the first major axis of the aligned monomer unit and the respective dimer solutions. Importantly, the documented familial Parkinson mutations A30P and A53T are located at the dimer interface. \n  \nDimer structures derived from intermolecular XL-MS data. (  A   and   B  ) Two prototypical solutions of the dimer calculation resembling monomer cluster A. While the interface is similar in both cases, slight deviations lead to a noticeable kink between subunits as demonstrated by the major axis of the monomers. While (  A  ) shows an angle between the major axis of the two subunits (  B  ) shows a near parallel offset. Mutations associated with familial forms of Parkinson\u2019s disease and studied by XL-MS here are indicated by pink (A30) and green (A53) spheres and are located at the interface. \n  \nAs \u03b1S forms oligomers on membranes, the obtained dimer structures were used to generate structural models for higher oligomers. Note that the chemical cross-link data ( ) indicate that \u03b1S oligomers are formed by progressive propagation on the membrane surface. Utilizing this information, oligomer structures were generated by joining \u03b1S dimers into larger chains, while retaining the inherent symmetry (  Methods  ). Starting from the two dimer structures ( ), we obtain oligomeric species with distinct symmetry properties: circular structures ( ) or elongated structures with helical periodicity along the translational (propagation) axis ( ). It should be noted, however, that the structures shown in   are representative solutions and slightly different structures can result from minute changes in the orientation across the \u03b1S dimer interface. For example, for the circular species also other ring sizes can be obtained and, likewise, for the elongated structure, a range of twist angles are possible. Depending on the twist angle, linear \u03b1S oligomers can be continuously attached to the membrane surface ( ) or adjacent \u03b1S monomers expose their membrane attachment sites (N-terminus) to opposite sides ( , up\u2013down arrangement). Thus, growing \u03b1S aggregates could either cover the surface of one membrane vesicle or bridge two different vesicles. Most importantly, the obtained circular \u03b1S oligomer structure ( ) is supported by previous experimental data. For example, comparable pore diameters (~5 nm as compared to ~4 nm in  ) were observed in EM studies of liposome-bound \u03b1S ( ). Further support comes from distance measurements based ondouble electron-electron resonance experiments which are also compatible with our structures ( ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) ( ) which detects particles of about ~10 nm as compared to ~11 nm in  . \n  \nPropagation of \u03b1-synuclein into higher oligomers. Deviations of the interface demonstrated in   lead to distinct oligomeric structures upon further addition of monomers. Dependent on the kink between the major axes, this results in either circular (  A   and   B  ) or linear/helical/extended (  C  \u2013  F  ) oligomeric structures. Individual \u03b1S molecules in the oligomers are coloured alternatingly (cyan brown) in one representation for each view [  Top   (  A  ,   C  , and\u00a0  E  ) and   Left   (  B  ,   D  , and   F  )]. Regions identified to interact with the polar head groups of the membrane surface (1\u201336: blue) or lipid tails within the inner layer of the lipid bilayer (70\u201388: red) in ref.\u00a0 \u00a0are indicated (  Bottom   (  A  ,   C  , and   E  ) and   Right   (  B  ,   D  , and   F  )]. Ring-like structures have a height and diameter of 51 \u00c5 and 108 \u00c5, respectively, which is in good agreement with dimensions extracted from EM-particle classifications. (  C  \u2013  F  ) Two representative structures of extended oligomers. While both oligomers form extended chains upon continuous addition of monomers, the orientation of monomers is different. Small (  C   and   D  ) or large (  E   and   F  ) rotational angles result in distinctly different interfaces either forming an   amphiphilic-like   [surface (1\u201336, blue) and inner layer (70\u201388, red) interactions on opposite sides (  C   and   D  )] or alternating [surface and inner layer interactions are alternating (  E   and   F  )] membrane interaction interface. \n  \nIt is also instructive to relate our findings to published solid-state NMR data of oligomeric \u03b1S ( ) which revealed the regions of \u03b1S either interacting with the lipid tail (residues 70 to 88) or the polar head groups (residues 1 to 36) of membranes. For example, insensitive nuclei enhancement by polarization transfer and dipolar-assisted rotational resonance spectra demonstrated differential mobilities for the two segments ( ). The respective regions are depicted in   (rigid part: 70 to 88, red; mobile part: 1 to 36, blue). In the circular species, the segment demonstrated to interact with the lipid tail (70 to 88, red) is located on one side of \u03b1S while the N-terminal helix (1 to 36, blue), which is in contact with the lipid head-group, is positioned toward the top and center of the ring-like structure. The elongated form also shows a distinct distribution of lipid and head group interacting residues. Depending on the twist angle, the oligomeric form can display an amphiphilic character with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface. Alternatively, lipid tail and head group interaction motifs can alternate as the oligomeric propagation proceeds. \n\n\n### The Effect of UCB0599 on Membrane-Bound Oligomeric \u03b1S. \n  \nThe obtained detailed structural information presented here allowed us to also gain insights into the mechanism of action of the small compound UCB0599 ( ) developed to target \u03b1S in its membrane-bound state. This compound with disease-modifying potential and an acceptable safety profile ( ) has entered phase 2 clinical trials as a different therapeutic strategy to combat Parkinson\u2019s disease. The design strategy for the compound was based on the interference with and ultimate release of \u03b1S from membrane vesicles. NMR heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments (HSQCs) were used to probe the interaction with \u03b1S and the compound-induced release of \u03b1S from the POPG-based liposomes used as membrane mimic.  N\u2013 H HSQC titration experiments of this compound with \u03b1S bound to POPG were performed as described previously ( ). Although liposomes are beyond the size limit of NMR and, thus, do not allow for direct detection of the bound state, the measurable signal of \u03b1S reveals how much of the protein is still freely tumbling in solution. When referencing the signal intensities observed to those of \u03b1S without liposomes, we can identify the regions (and fractions) of \u03b1S bound to liposomes ( ). It should be noted that while the clinical candidate is the purified enantiomer, here measurements were performed with the racemic mixture, as we have demonstrated that interactions between membrane-bound \u03b1S and the two enantiomers are identical ( ). Titration experiments were performed to get more detailed insights into the characteristics of the interaction between UCB0599 and membrane-bound \u03b1S ( ). Here, all detected signal intensity is stemming from unbound protein regions, and a comparison between conditions without liposomes and those with liposomes present allows for a determination of the liposome-bound fraction. Inspection of the concentration dependence ( ) clearly reveals a pronounced cooperative transition from the membrane-bound to the free state [as also observed for NPT100-18A, an early molecule used for proof of mechanism studies ( )] indicating a specific targeting of UCB0599 to the oligomer. Most importantly, higher \u03b1S concentrations require smaller amounts of UCB0599 for displacement (as shown in  ) indicating that the relevant species for compound binding and subsequent displacement is not monomeric \u03b1S, but rather the oligomeric state. This is further substantiated by the fact that the release is not reducing affinity for different regions of \u03b1S but releases all parts of the protein at once ( ). We thus decided to analyze putative changes of the oligomeric state of \u03b1S by using low concentrations of UCB0599 insufficient to release \u03b1S from the liposome surface ( ). Most importantly, while the HSQC data ( ) were nearly unchanged and thus confirmed the prevalence of the liposome-bound state of \u03b1S under these conditions, dark state electron-transfer (DEST) experiments ( ) clearly revealed an alteration of the membrane-bound species ( ). The decreased DEST effect (smaller signal linewidth in the bound state) suggests increased flexibility of \u03b1S in the bound state prior to displacement, presumably by weakening both (homooligomeric) interactions between individual \u03b1S units and \u03b1S interactions with the membrane. \n  \nThe effect of UCB0599 on \u03b1-synuclein. Addition of the small-molecule UCB0599 to liposome-bound \u03b1S modifies the underlying ensemble at low concentration and displaces the protein at elevated ligand concentration. (  A  ) Following the stepwise addition of the compound while referencing to the free C-terminus of the protein ( ), concentration-dependent displacement of \u03b1S from POPG-based liposomes is observed. Here, signals of unbound \u03b1S regions are measured and their relative intensity between conditions with and without liposomes reports on the bound fraction. This dependence shows cooperative behavior and is dependent on the ratio between protein and liposomes. Best-HSQC (  B  ) and DEST (  C  ) measurements show that at lower concentrations no change in displaced \u03b1S is observed in HSQCs while an increase in DEST intensity already reflects an increase in flexibility of the bound form. When testing for changes in the bound form of the protein (  D  ), clear changes in the cross-linking pattern are observed upon addition of the compound. Intermolecular PSMs show a reduction in links in some regions [(92\u2013101) to (58\u201362), marked *] while increasing in others [(54\u201361) to (8\u201316), marked #]. These regions are found at the interface in our calculated dimer ( ) and highlighted in  . The number of PSMs found in a four-residue window is indicated in the color scale. \n  \nIn order to specifically probe UCB0599-induced structural changes in the oligomeric state, we again employ  N/ N labeled 1:1 mixtures of isotopically labeled \u03b1S to probe XL-MS patterns of liposome-bound \u03b1S by using low concentrations of UCB0599. \n\nThe differences between intermolecular PSMs observed for \u03b1S in each form are shown in   (the underlying PSM maps are given in  ). The addition of UCB0599 leads to clear changes of the intermolecular cross-links ( ), while intramolecular cross-links did show relatively small fluctuations. Specifically, intermolecular interactions were less frequent between regions (94\u2013101) and (58\u201362), while an increase in cross-links was observed for regions (54\u201361) and (8\u201316). These regions are located at the interface of the obtained dimer structures ( ). Distinct changes of the intermolecular cross-link pattern were also observed for interfacial residues in \u03b1S versions carrying familial PD (A30P and A53T) mutations and indicate alterations of the interaction interface in membrane-bound oligomers for these pathogenic forms of \u03b1S ( ). Summing up, distinct interactions exist between UCB0599 and liposome-bound \u03b1S oligomers and these interactions affect the dynamics of individual \u03b1S monomers as well as interactions across the oligomeric interface and thereby alter the oligomeric state distribution of \u03b1S, giving us a good description of the mechanism-of-action of UCB0599. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDespite the experimental evidence linking the toxicity of \u03b1S oligomers and higher-order aggregates to the disruption of membrane integrity, little is known about the molecular-level details and how membrane permeability is modulated by \u03b1S\u2019s oligomeric state. In this work, we utilize NMR spectroscopy to probe compact states of \u03b1S\u2019s structural ensemble in the membrane-bound state. In combination with isotope-edited cross-linking mass spectrometry data generated with a zero-length cross-linker, we focus on the compact state of \u03b1S and derive high-resolution structural models of membrane-bound \u03b1S dimers and higher oligomers. Despite the well-established conformational flexibility (i.e., interconversion between extended and bent \u03b1-helical states) of membrane-bound \u03b1S, a surprisingly well-defined conformational ensemble was obtained with our approach. It consists of three compact states, one of which is in good agreement with the previously determined structure of SDS-micelle\u2013bound \u03b1S ( ). Importantly, however, the improved sensitivity of our integrated experimental approach (NMR spectroscopy and XL-MS, see also  ) revealed the existence of an ensemble of conformational substates. \n\nThe experimental data suggest the existence of two prototypical oligomeric topologies: circular, ring-like structures and extended, twisted oligomers. Although the diameter of the circular structures and the exact twist angle of the elongated species can vary (and presumably depend on biological context and environmental conditions, i.e., additional interaction partners located at synaptic vesicles), we postulate a dynamic equilibrium between the prototypical oligomeric species. It is important to note that the oligomeric forms likely differ significantly in terms of membrane embedding and size distribution. \n\nThe circular (ring-like) structure shows features that presumably allow it to partly insert into membranes and lead to membrane distortion. Specifically, inspection of the ring-like structure in   suggests a plausible mechanism how \u03b1S inserts into lipid bilayers. Many amphipathic peptides can extract lipid molecules from bilayer assemblies and cause semitransmembrane defects (i.e., cathelicidin LL-37) ( ) and pore disruptions ( ). The distribution of hydrophobic (red) and hydrophilic (blue) residues in the ring-like structure ( ) suggests a similar insertion mechanism for \u03b1S (similarities to such a peptide are expanded upon in supplementary information  ). Support for this possibility comes from an AFM study on the interaction between \u03b1S and membranes ( ). AFM studies performed on planar lipid bilayers detected semitransmembrane defects induced by \u03b1S. These defects formed by lipid extraction are covered by a large number of \u03b1S nanoscale particles with a diameter of ~10 nm ( ) matching the diameter of ring-like structures presented here (  ~11 nm). Further evidence for the plausibility of this mechanism comes from the established preference of \u03b1S for localization on liquid-disordered phases in anionic vesicles ( ), where insertion into more fluid parts of the anionic vesicle is facilitated, an effect also seen in the higher affinity observed for smaller diameter vesicles ( ). \n\nIn contrast, the elongated oligomeric structures can linearly propagate (without additional geometrical constraints) and form high molecular weight oligomers. Due to the inherent twist angle ( ), progressive (linear) oligomerization is not compatible with continuous membrane attachment as increasing chain length leads to a displacement of membrane-interacting residues from the surface. The proposed ultimate detachment from the membrane would, thus, lead to an oligomer with exposed interaction surfaces, which might be more prone to intermolecular interactions and subsequent aggregate formation. \n\nWe thus propose that proper regulation of the equilibrium between different oligomer topologies is crucial for the authentic functionality of \u03b1S in its biological context. The possibility to populate several oligomeric forms offers \u03b1S the possibility to interact and engage with its diverse binding partners. Conversely, misbalance or deregulation of this process might prevent proper interactions and contribute to the observed pathologies. On the other hand, interventions influencing the equilibrium or modifying the oligomeric states might alleviate pathologies that result from a misbalance of the preexisting equilibrium. Interestingly, the two well-known familial Parkinson\u2019s mutations (A53T and A30P, see  ) are located at the interface (facing each other across the interface). Analysis of XL-MS data indicates that the overall structures of the \u03b1S monomers and dimers in the fully bound state are not strongly influenced when these point mutations are introduced while intermolecular cross-links are distinctly altered ( ). We thus postulate that upon mutation, slight adaptations occur across the interaction interface and lead to a shift in the structure or prevalence of oligomeric species, which could explain the differing surface affinities observed (likely the elongated, twisted form is preferentially formed in A53T and A30P) with subsequent alterations of overall membrane affinities, as reported previously ( ). \n\nAnother important finding of this study is the difference in intermolecular \u03b1S interactions depending on whether the interaction occurs on the same lipid vesicle (cis, i.e., liposomes) or between different membrane species (trans, i.e., bicelles). Importantly, both of these states show different interaction patterns than those observed in the fibrillar state, reflecting the remarkable in\u00a0vivo structural heterogeneity of \u03b1S ( ) ( ,  ). The data obtained in this study suggest that although the widely studied \u03b1S amyloids and their toxicity are of vital importance in PD pathology, they probably represent later stages of in\u00a0vivo (in vitro) aggregation processes ( ), while toxicity at the membrane is likely initially related to smaller oligomeric species with different conformations. The high amount of membrane structures and relatively low fibril content of Lewy Bodies also points toward membrane-bound \u03b1S as a main culprit in PD pathology ( ). New therapeutic strategies in addition to ongoing approaches focussing on the development of antiamyloid agents disrupting large intracellular fibrils, targeting cell-to-cell propagation of misfolded beta-sheet rich aggregates or inhibiting fibril growth processes starting from protofibril \u201cseeds\u201d ( ) might thus offer attractive opportunities. In a previous study, a small-molecule compound was identified that interferes with the initial steps of the toxicity-inducing process by altering the structural properties of membrane-bound \u03b1S and thereby preventing the subsequent formation of smaller oligomeric \u03b1S ( ). Although no detailed structural information was available at that time, the hypothesis was formulated that there exists an equilibrium between different oligomeric states and that the compound reduces the conversion to propagating dimers and oligomers, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and electron microscopy ( ). Additional development led to a compound demonstrating beneficial effects in mouse model systems ( ). Building on the demonstrated mechanism, significant optimization efforts were undertaken to improve brain permeability and obtain a new molecule with pharmacological properties suitable for clinical development, yielding the compound UCB0599 ( ). In contrast to the earlier compound ( ), UCB0599 has much improved bioavailability and reaches the brain in sufficient quantities for clinical development. Its safety profile has also been evaluated in phase1/1b studies to support further clinical development ( ). In analogy to the previous compound ( ), we show a cooperative effect and increasing cooperativity at higher \u03b1S:POPG ratios, demonstrating that UCB0599 targets \u03b1S which in our conditions is present in oligomeric states. This observed cooperativity holds for all regions of the protein ( ) and is sustained in point mutations ( ), indicating that the oligomeric state is specifically targeted and displaced. The XL-MS and NMR data presented in our study provide strong evidence for the proposed hypothesis. Specifically, the DEST experiments ( ) show that prior to displacement, additional flexibility is introduced to bound \u03b1S, followed by full displacement at higher concentrations. The XL-MS data ( \u00a0and\u00a0 ) convincingly show that the compound leads to changes in the cross-link pattern for residues located at the interface, presumably a reflection of the same process causing increased flexibility introduced by UCB0599. Most importantly, the DEST data provided evidence that the compound affects the structural integrity (rigidity) of \u03b1S oligomers and their interactions with the membrane mimic already at low concentration. This likely diminishes membrane interactions and impairs embedding of \u03b1S oligomers into the membrane and, thus, mitigates possible semitransmembrane defects or membrane-pore formation caused by \u03b1S. Our study supports the previous hypothesis and suggests that the beneficial therapeutic effect of UCB0599 is indeed most likely due to an alteration of membrane-bound \u03b1S oligomers, the subsequent reduction in the number of membrane-bound oligomeric structures capable of seeding aggregate formation and ultimate displacement of \u03b1S from the membrane. To conclude, UCB0599 exerts its beneficial effects already in the membrane-bound state by reducing the populations and thus detrimental downstream effects of both (toxic) oligomeric forms, introducing higher flexibility to oligomers, before ultimately releasing \u03b1S in its monomeric (random-coil like) form. A model for the dynamic equilibrium of membrane-bound \u03b1S oligomers and the influence of UCB0599 is shown in  . \n  \nModel for membrane-bound oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein and UCB0599\u2019s mode-of-action. The membrane-bound state of \u03b1S is characterized by an ensemble of different oligomer topologies (circular vs. elongated). While the elongated form (  Left  ) might be involved in seeding with membranes ( ) when growing too large, the circular structure (  Right  ) is likely relevant for membrane defects and possibly pore formation ( ). Proper functioning of \u03b1S requires a subtle balancing in order to avoid the formation of these toxic variants. The proposed MoA of UCB0599 involves interference with oligomeric \u03b1S on the membrane and thereby shifting the equilibrium away from species capable of generating toxic effects (elongated and circular) toward a conformational state (represented by the central cartoon marked #) characterized by increased flexibility and decreased membrane embedding. The resulting loosening of membrane-attachment facilitates displacement of \u03b1S from the membrane with UCB0599 (depicted as red spheres). At sufficiently high concentrations, \u03b1S is displaced from the membrane in a monomeric form (  Bottom  ). Regions of \u03b1S interacting with lipid tails (red) or hydrophilic head groups (blue) are indicated ( ). \n  \nDisrupting the formation of membrane-embedded \u03b1S oligomers at an early stage of aggregation before irreversible neurodegenerative processes has been initiated as a promising intervention strategy to combat Parkinson\u2019s disease, complementing efforts to reduce amyloids. The now available (high-resolution) 3D structural information about surface-bound \u03b1S oligomers together with the XL-MS interaction data provide unique insight into UCB0599\u2019s MoA, a molecule currently being tested in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients in a phase 2 clinical trial. This demonstration of the potential therapeutic relevance of \u03b1S oligomer changes on membrane surfaces for Parkinson\u2019s disease sets the stage for future intervention strategies exploiting this fundamental process. Additionally, detailed knowledge about the structural features of membrane-bound \u03b1S oligomers offers exciting possibilities to expand our understanding regarding the many facets of this still enigmatic protein. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Protein Production. \n  \nThe expression and purification of recombinant human \u03b1S were carried out similarly as described previously ( ). In order to obtain >95% of  N labeling in samples used for XLMS, precultures were grown in a labeled medium. NMR samples were obtained by generating cell mass in an unlabeled medium. Samples used for assignment were produced using the same method but with D O replacing H O in the induced medium to partially deuterate and achieve improved TROSY efficiency ( ). \n\n#### Cross-Linking. \n  \nCross-linking reactions of \u03b1S were carried similarly as published ( ). As required, 50 \u00b5M  N \u03b1S or 50 \u00b5M of a 1:1 istotopic  N: N mixture of \u03b1S bound to 1 mg/ml of POPG-based liposomes was incubated with 2 mM EDC\u00a0and 5 mM hydroxy-2,5-dioxopyrrolidine-3-sulfonic acid for 60 min at room temperature for all cross-linking experiments containing liposomes (produced as published) ( ). Despite the relatively high amount of \u03b1S relative to the liposomal surface, the majority of the protein is observed in the monomeric, bound form ( ). In order to determine the effect of UCB0599 without displacement of the protein, 50 \u00b5M of the compound (racemic mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) or 1% DMSO (in the reference condition) was added. Conditions containing bicelles or SDS-micelles were generated with 100 \u00b5M of isotopically mixed \u03b1S and 15 mM bicelles (composed of 10 mM 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 5 mM 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) or with isotopically mixed \u03b1S and 40 mM SDS, respectively. All cross-linking reactions were carried out in 50mM phosphate buffer, pH = 6.5 containing 50 mM NaCl. Cross-linking was carried out shortly after mixing the protein and membrane components with the exception of the aggregated sample where \u03b1S and bicelles were incubated at 50 \u00b0C o/n. All reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE after being stopped with 50 mM Tris and 20 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Bands of the monomer and dimer forms were cut and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. \n\n\n#### Intact Protein Mass Spectrometry. \n  \nFor intact mass measurements, unlabeled ( N only) \u03b1S was cross-linked in the presence of liposomes. After the reaction, 1 mM of the compound ( ) was added to displace \u03b1S from the liposomal surface. The sample was then incubated at RT for 20 min before ultracentrifugation at 100.000 [g] for 1 h. The supernatant of this reaction was injected onto a SEC column (Superdex 75 Increase 5/150GL). We detected a peak of the monomer and a second, mixed peak. Protein solutions from the mixed peak were diluted with water to a final concentration of 5 to 10 ng/\u03bcL. Up to 30 ng of protein were injected on a nano high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Scientific, Dionex) equipped with a C4 column (AERIS C4 widepore, 3.6 \u00b5m, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) running a step gradient from 9 to 36\u201363% ACN in 0.08% formic acid. The LC was coupled to the Synapt G2Si mass spectrometer via the Zspray\u2122-ion source (both Waters) operated by MassLynx 4.1 software. The mass spectrometer was run in resolution mode, and capillary voltage was set to 3 kV cone voltage to 40 V. The source was at 120 \u00b0C, desolvation at 400 \u00b0C. Lock spray correction was applied and Glu-1-fibrinopeptide was used as lock mass. Data were acquired in the m/z range of 600 to 2,000. Spectra were summed over the peak retention time window and masses were deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 method. \n\n\n#### XL-MS and Data Analysis. \n  \nIsotopically mixed ( N and  N) \u03b1S was cross-linked in the presence of liposomes as described. The resulting protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and bands corresponding to mono- and dimer bands were excised and destained After reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide, trypsin and chymotrypsin were used for proteolytic cleavage. Peptides were extracted in the ultrasonication bath and desalted ( ). \n\nPeptides were analyzed on an HPLC coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X or an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a Nanospray Flex ion source. Equal amounts of the samples were loaded on a trap column using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase. After 10 min, the trap column was switched in line with the analytical C18 column and peptides were eluted applying a segmented linear gradient from 2 to 80% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; solvent A 0.1% formic acid) at 230 nL/min over 120 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode, survey scans were obtained in a mass range of 350 to 1,650 m/z with lock mass activated, at a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z and an AGC target value of 3E6 (HF-X) or 4E5 (Lumos). The 10 most intense ions (HF-X) were selected with an isolation width of 1.6 Thomson for a max. of 250 ms, fragmented in the higher-energy C-trap dissociation cell at 28% (HF-X) or 30% (Lumos), and the spectra were recorded at a target value of 1E5 and a resolution of 60,000. Peptides with a charge of +1, +2, or >+7 were excluded from fragmentation, peptide match was set to preferred, the exclude isotope feature was enabled, and selected precursors were dynamically excluded from repeated sampling for 20 s within a mass tolerance of 8 ppm. \n\nRaw data were processed using the MaxQuant software package ( ) (v. 1.6.0.13), and spectra were searched against a combined database of the \u03b1S construct sequence, the   E. coli   K12 reference proteome (Uniprot), and a database containing common contaminants. \n\nTo identify cross-linked peptides, the spectra were searched using Kojak ( ) (v. 1.6.1). Raw files were converted to mzML format using msconvert in ProteoWizard ( ) and searched against a database containing the 8 most abundant protein hits identified in the MaxQuant search. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as variable. Trypsin/chymotrypsin was set as enzyme specificity; EDC was used for cross-linking chemistry, and the 15N mode was activated. Search results were filtered for 1% FDR (q-value < 0.01) at the PSM level using Percolator (v. 2.08). An additional PEP cutoff of < 0.05 was applied. \n\nDue to the flexibility in our system, a large set of cross-links was observed. As the information on cross-links is too sparse to calculate reliable ensembles, we chose to make a visual representation of the average distribution of cross-links the focus of our analysis. The resulting cross-link pattern is shown as a matrix depicting contacts between positions in the primary sequence. \n\nN\u2013 N and  N\u2013 N contacts were observed in the dimer bands of SDS-PAGE gels. PSMs detected within  N\u2013 N and  N\u2013 N isotope-labeled versions of the protein stem from both inter- and intra-molecular interactions of the protein. We, therefore, subtracted mixed isotopic contacts from those observed within each isotopic species in order to obtain the intramolecular contacts within a single \u03b1S molecule of a dimer band. \n\nMore details regarding the construction of the \u201cPSM-matrix\u201d and statistical treatment of the observed differences are available in supplementary methods. \n\n\n#### NMR. \n  \nAssignment of SDS-bound \u03b1S was carried out using best versions of 3D backbone assignment pulse sequences on an AVANCE NEO 600 MHz instrument equipped with a triple resonance probe ( ). Measurements were carried out on a 0.15 mM sample at 323 K with 40 mM SDS in a 20 mM phosphate buffer pH = 5.5 with 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM azide, and the resulting data along with detailed measurement parameters was deposited on the BMRB database (ID:50996) ( ). Best-HSQC and DEST measurements ( ) were carried out with 0.4 mM \u03b1S and 0.4 mg/mL POPG liposomes at 35 \u00b0C, in a 50 mM phosphate buffer pH = 6.5 with 50 mM NaCl using dark state energy-transfer irradiation at +/\u22122 kHz offset in the nitrogen dimension with referencing to 30 kHz offset and 0.5 s of irradiation. Best-HSQC measurements in   also used 0.2 mM \u03b1S and 0.2 mg/ml POPG where indicated. \n\n\n#### Molecular Structure Determination and PRI Potential. \n  \nAn energy term for Xplor-NIH was developed to allow the use of experimental PRI values as restraints during structure calculation. This was implemented as a long-range angle potential that penalizes angle segments depending on the sign of the measured PRI ( ). Structures were calculated using the molecular structure determination package Xplor-NIH ( ,  ). Initial monomer structure calculations were based mainly on PRE, PRI, and torsion angle restraints. In a follow up, the best monomers were used to calculate dimeric complexes by incorporating intermolecular MS-cross-links as pseudo NOEs ( ). A short graphical summary of the model generation workflow is shown in  . \n\n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10104497, "text_md5": "4892c64fb58f8cf931ed7567cd1cea4d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 186], "journal": [187, 211], "publication_year": [213, 217], "title": [228, 361], "keywords": [375, 452], "abstract": [465, 2824], "body": [2833, 55415]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37027427, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2201910120", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10104497", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10104497"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10104497\">10104497</a>", "list_title": "PMC10104497  High-resolution structural information of membrane-bound \u03b1-synuclein provides insight into the MoA of the anti-Parkinson drug UCB0599"}

We aim to analyze the neural activity changes in PD-related EDS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nIn the present study, 38 PD patients and 19 healthy controls underwent clinical assessments and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. Patients were further classified into PD patients with EDS (  n   = 17) and PD patients without EDS (  n   = 21), according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) cutoff score with greater than 10 or less than 3. We evaluated all patients using PD-related motor and non-motor clinical scales. An analysis of covariance and   post hoc   two-sample   t  -tests were performed to examine between-groups differences of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found that, all PD-EDS subjects in our study were male. Compared with the control subjects, PD patients with EDS had decreased ALFF in the Pons and increased ALFF in the Frontal_Mid_Orb_L (  p   < 0.01, corrected). Moreover, PD patients with EDS showed decreased ALFF in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to PD without EDS, which was negatively correlated with the ESS score (  p   < 0.001). After that, the FC analysis with the left PCC region of interest showed reduced FC of the right PCC and right precuneus in PD with EDS compared with PD without EDS (  p   < 0.01, corrected). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe hypothesized the wake-promoting pathways and the default mode network dysfunction underlying the EDS in male PD patients. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common feature of Parkinson disease (PD). It manifests as unintentional or inappropriate sleep, namely, inability to stay awake during the day. A large proportion of patients with PD develop EDS with longer disease duration ( ), which contributes to poor quality of patients\u2019 life and increases the risk of harm, such as traffic accidents ( ). Previous studies found that EDS is a separate manifestation of PD ( ) and supported the hypothesis of EDS representing a form of primary insomnia. During last few decades, focus was drawn to EDS and its correlated factors in PD ( ;  ); however, current treatment options for EDS in PD are very limited ( ) and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. \n\nIn fact, regarding EDS in PD, several neuroimaging methods have been used to preliminarily explore cerebral changes, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( ;  ), diffusion tensor MRI ( ;  ), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ( ;  ), and resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) ( ). Nevertheless, conflicting results existed among those researches due to the lack of healthy controls or the limitations of topical brain analysis. \n\nRs-fMRI, examining whole-brain spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI without any explicit input or output, indirectly shows a manifestation of spontaneous neuronal activity ( ). For example, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) measures the spontaneous amplitude of low-frequency (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) BOLD signal at the local level ( ); whereas, functional connectivity (FC) indicates inter-regional temporal patterns of the BOLD signal at the network level ( ). In recent years, they have been applied widely to the study of neuropathologic mechanisms ( ;  ). \n\nIn the present study, to address the association of EDS in PD patients and neural activity changes, we focused on rs-fMRI combining the ALFF with FC approaches. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nIn total, 64 patients enrolled in the study were required to meet the following criteria: (1) meeting the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic PD according to the United Kingdom Parkinson Disease Society Brain Bank criteria; (2) without medical history of traumatic brain injury stroke, brain tumor, dementia, or psychiatric disorders; (3) without contraindications for MRI scan; (4) a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than 24; (5) not taking sedative and hypnotic medications; and (6) excluding sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, and obstructive sleep apnea that may contribute to EDS. Patients were recruited consecutively from the outpatients at our hospital, and were at first clinically evaluated by a neurologist, who is a trained movement disorder specialist and sensitized to psychiatric disorders in PD. Patients were also evaluated about sleep symptoms in a face-to-face interview and by the specific questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). \n\nThe ESS contains eight items with a score ranging from 0 to 24 that measure the subject\u2019s expectation of dozing in eight daily situations within the past 3 months. This questionnaire, with satisfactory clinimetric results (validity, reliability, and sensitivity), is recommended by Movement Disorder Society for rating daytime sleepiness to categorize and measure severity ( ). Thus, we classified PD patients into PD patients with EDS (PD-EDS) (  n   = 17) with a ESS score of 10 or greater, and PD patients without EDS (PD-non-EDS) (  n   = 21) with a ESS score 3 or less ( ;  ;  ); Meanwhile, patients with ESS scores from 3 to 10 were excluded (  n   = 26). \n\nSubsequently, we evaluated all patients using clinical scales. Motor-related assessments included the unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS-III) score, the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) score, the tremor score, and the Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging score. Cognition-related assessments included the MMSE and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Other sleep assessments included the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and the REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were used to detect the severity of anxiety and depression separately. In addition, we calculated total levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), LEDD of levodopa preparations, and LEDD of dopamine receptor agonists of each PD patient according to the previous description ( ). MRI scans and clinical examinations took place while all patients had been anti-Parkinson free for at least 12 h. In addition, age- and education- matched control subjects (HC) (  n   = 19) were recruited for this study. None of these controls had any history of neurological or psychological disorders. The present study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI scanning was performed with a 3.0 T Siemens MAGNETOM Verio whole-body MRI system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany) equipped with eight-channel, phase-array head coils. We used tight foam padding to minimize head movement and ear-plugs for reducing noise. Subjects were instructed to remain motionless, think nothing and avoid falling asleep with our reminders. Three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using the following volumetric 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 1900 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.95 ms, flip angle (FA) = 9\u00b0, slice thickness = 1 mm, slices = 160, field of view (FOV) = 230 \u00d7 230 mm , matrix size = 256 \u00d7 256 and voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm ). Resting-state functional images were collected using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 21 ms, FA = 90\u00b0, FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm , in-plane matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, slices = 35, slice thickness = 3 mm, no slice gap, voxel size = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm , total 4 volumes = 240). \n\n\n### Data Processing \n  \nThe data were analyzed using the data processing assistant for resting-state fMRI (DPARSF ) ( ) with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8 ). Steps included: (1) removal of the first 10 time points; (2) slice timing correction; (3) head motion correction via six-parameter rigid body spatial transformation during data acquisition; (4) non-linear registration of the high-resolution T1 structural images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template, in which T1 structural images were segmented as white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using a new segment algorithm with DARTEL (diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra), followed by further structural analyses of the resulting segments; (5) nuisance signal removal (white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, global signal, 6-head motion parameters as covariates) via multiple regression; (6) spatial normalization to the MNI template; (7) resampling of images into a spatial resolution of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm ; and (8) spatial smoothening with a Gaussian kernel (full-width at half-maximum = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 mm ). We excluded subjects from further analysis if the translation or rotation of head movement was greater than 2 mm or 2\u00b0 in any direction. \n\n\n### ALFF Analysis \n  \nThe ALFF calculation procedure was as follows: (1) fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to convert all voxels from the time domain to the frequency domain; (2) the ALFF of every voxel was calculated by averaging the square root of the power spectrum across 0.01 Hz to 0.08 Hz; and (3) the resulting ALFF was converted into z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the global standard deviation for standardization purposes. \n\n\n### FC Analysis \n  \nBefore FC analysis, band-pass filtering (0.01 < f < 0.08 Hz) was performed and the linear trend was removed for weakening the linear drift of rs-fMRI signal time series. Then FC analysis was performed using the Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit . Based on the ALFF result, the region that showed significant difference between the PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS subject groups and correlation with ESS score was defined as the region of interest (ROI). After that, we performed a voxel-wise FC analysis by computing the temporal correlation between the mean time series of the ROI and the time series of each voxel within the brain. Pearson correlation coefficient maps were created for each individual subject and were converted to a   z  -value using the Fisher z transformation ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe clinical data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics v20.0.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, United States). We employed Fisher exact test for gender, as well as one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for age and gender and two-sample   t   tests for the remaining variables. \n\nAn analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine brain areas with significant differences among the three groups with age, gender, education, and gray matter volume as nuisance variables (voxel-level   p   < 0.01, cluster size >22 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction) . These areas were then extracted as a mask. Next, we performed two-sample   post hoc t   tests within this mask to further detect significant differences between groups, controlling for the same covariates mentioned previously (voxel-level   p   < 0.01, cluster size >5 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). Subsequently, we extracted the cluster showing significant ALFF difference between PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS groups and calculated the average ALFF value of which to explore the correlation with ESS score and PDSS score using the Pearson correlation, respectively (  p   < 0.01). \n\nAfter that, we also conducted ANCOVA among three groups (voxel-level   p   < 0.01, cluster size >19 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.05 as determined by AlphaSim correction) and followed with a two-sample   post hoc t   test to explore the altered FC of the defined ROI between PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS subject groups (voxel-level   p   < 0.01, cluster size >3 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). Besides, two sample   t   test was used to compare PD groups with healthy controls (the voxel-level   p   < 0.01, cluster size >18 voxels, corresponding to a corrected   p   < 0.01 as determined by AlphaSim correction). Age, gender, education, and gray matter volume were put into covariates as well. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \n presents the clinical characteristics of all subjects. We found no significant differences in age and education level among the PD-EDS, PD-non-EDS, and HC groups. However, all PD-EDS subjects in our study were male, and did not match with the other two groups. The PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS had similar disease duration, H-Y staging, UPDRS-III scores, PIGD scores, tremor scores and medication. In addition, there were no significant differences in non-motor symptoms such as RBDSQ scores, MMSE scores, FAB scores, HAMD scores and HAMA scores (  p   > 0.05). As we expected, the PD-EDS patients showed higher ESS scores and PDSS scores relative to the PD-non-EDS patients (  p   < 0.05). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects. \n    \n\n### ALFF Data \n  \nAmong the three study groups, significant ALFF differences were found in Cingulum_Post_L, Pons, and Frontal_Mid_Orb_L. Next, the PD-EDS group showed decreased ALFF in Cingulum_Post_L compared with the PD-non-EDS group. Interestingly, compared with HC, both PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS study groups showed decreased ALFF in pons and increased ALFF in Frontal_Mid_Orb_L, and PD-non-EDS subjects were overall lower (  and  ). \n  \nALFF and FC analysis via between-groups comparisons. \n      \nAnalysis of ALFF and FC data   (a)  : Regions that showed significant ALFF differences via between-group comparisons (  P   < 0.01, AlphaSim corrected).   (b)   Correlation analysis between ESS scores and ALFF values of Cingulum_Post_L (  P   < 0.001).   (c)   Regions with which Cingulum_Post_L FC showed significant differences between PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS (  P   < 0.01, AlphaSim corrected). ALFF: The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; FC, Functional connectivity; PD-EDS, Parkinson disease with excessive daytime sleepiness; PD-non-EDS, Parkinson disease without excessive daytime sleepiness; HC, Healthy control subjects. \n  \n showed significantly negative correlation between ALFF values of Cingulum_Post_L and ESS scores in PD patients (  r   = \u22120.618,   p   < 0.001), but not with PDSS scores. \n\n\n### FC Data \n  \nLikewise, in performing the ANCOVA and two-sample   post hoc t   tests, the PD-EDS group showed decreased Cingulum_Post_L FC with Cingulum_Post_R and Precuneus_R as compared with the PD-non-EDS group (  and  ). Compared with healthy controls, PD subjects showed decreased FC between Cingulum_Post_L and Cerebelum_Crus1_L ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we observed the association between EDS in PD and altered neural activity at two levels, with ALFF at the local level and FC at the network level. At first, the abnormal ALFF of PD-EDS compared to HC in the Pons and Frontal_Mid_Orb_L supported the hypothesis that the wake-promoting pathway deficits were associated with EDS in PD. Furthermore, reduced ALFF of the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and its reduced FC with right PCC and right precuneus in PD-EDS relative to PD-non-EDS hinted at the abnormal default mode network (DMN, e.g., PCC, precuneus, inferior parietal lobe, medial prefrontal cortex) in PD-related EDS. It is worth noting that the PD-EDS groups in this study were all males, which were not matched with other groups. To minimize gender bias, gender was analyzed as a covariate in this study. Nevertheless, we should be cautious when interpreting neural activity changes of PD-EDS. The PD-EDS related neural activity changes in this study might only be applicable to male patients. \n\nThe Pons contain the wake-promoting neuronal populations, including the serotonergic neurons of dorsal raphe nucleus, the noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus, the cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) ( ) and parafacial GABAergic/glycinergic neurons ( ). In this regard, ascending projections from these main pontine wake-promoting neurons activate the thalamus, which in turn arouses the neurons in the cerebral cortex. In addition, the ascending reticular activating system exists in the reticular formation of the Pons. All these wake-promoting pathways contribute to the maintenance of wakefulness. Hence, reduced ALFF in the Pons in this study might result in sleep-wake state instability owing to disruption of wake-promoting pathways, eventually associated with manifestation of EDS in PD. Previously,   proposed the hypothesis of ascending brain stem degeneration in early PD, involving some aforementioned non-dopaminergic brain stem nuclei, which could also propel our understanding of sleep dysfunction in PD. \n\nApplying structural MRI with morphometry, local brain stem atrophy was found in connection with EDS in PD ( ); however, another structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry showed extensive cortical and subcortical brain atrophy in PD-EDS ( ). Moreover, an early SPECT study reported decreased regional cerebral blood flow of the cerebral cortex, but no significant differences in brain stem perfusion between PD-EDS and PD-non-EDS ( ). The discrepancy in these results could be attributed to different neuroimaging approaches, analysis methods, or whether to control the confounding factors. Nevertheless, an analogous rs-fMRI study ( ) applied regional homogeneity and FC analysis methods and the results were completely different from ours. It is attractive that they enrolled early drug na\u00efve PD patients, but they did not use control subjects. We made the adjustment by recruiting healthy control subjects. Moreover, despite that our PD subjects were not drug na\u00efve, the PD-EDS group and PD-non-EDS groups were well matched in drug usage and other possible EDS-related factors in our study. Thus, according to our results, we still speculated that EDS was associated with the impaired wake-promoting pathways in PD. \n\nNotably, PD-EDS patients had worse nocturnal sleep problems as assessed by PDSS in our study, which was consistent with previous work ( ). However, PDSS scores in PD patients were not statistically correlated with left PCC ALFF values, which were significantly negatively correlated with ESS scores. Thus, the decreased left PCC ALFF was specific for PD-related EDS. Further, we found reduced left PCC FC with right PCC and adjacent right precuneus when PD-EDS were compared to PD-non-EDS. Interestingly, the precuneus/PCC is the key node in the DMN ( ); in other words, there is a strong interaction between the precuneus/PCC and the rest regions of the DMN. Therefore, neural activity reductions of the precuneus/PCC might lead to functional impairments of the DMN. Indeed, the DMN is responsible for a conscious awareness and introspective state in which people are awake and alert ( ), and functional decoupling of the anterior and posterior DMN nodes could indicate the loss of conscious awareness during deep sleep ( ), which added support to the reduced FC of posterior DMN nodes occurring in ESD in the present study. This could be bolstered by a recent rs-fMRI study, which showed that daytime sleepiness in healthy subjects was associated with impaired FC in the DMN independent of age and brain structure ( ). In addition, the PCC is considered to be responsible for arousal and attention and its interactions with other networks may be linked to conscious awareness ( ), supporting the association we found with EDS. However, converging evidence suggests that there are structural and functional abnormalities of the PCC and DMN in other neurological and psychiatric diseases, for instance, Alzheimer disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and mood disorders ( ;  ). Herein, the role of the DMN in PD-related EDS still requires further investigation in future work. \n\nIt is well known that the DMN is strongly related to internal cognitive modes ( ). Since decreased DMN connectivity is observed in amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( ) and Alzheimer disease dementia. DMN connectivity is also significantly decreased in subjects who are deeply asleep ( ), lightly sedated ( ), descending into sleep ( ), as well as EDS ( ). These results suggest that decreased DMN connectivity during the daytime may reflect a more \u201csleep-like\u201d state in the brain. This may also indicate a neural mechanism by which EDS can result in cognitive impairment. In our study, although there was no statistically significant difference between PD-EDS group and PD-non-EDS group, the score of MMSE of PD-EDS group was lower than that of PD-non-EDS group. This implies an interesting relationship between cognitive impairment and EDS, thus further research is needed. \n\nSeveral limitations are existed. First, the ESS is a subjective self-reported questionnaire. To promote the sensitivity of discriminating subjects with similar levels of sleepiness, we defined an ESS score of 10 or greater as PD-EDS and the ESS score of 3 or less as PD-non-EDS. Even so, the objective instruments such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and polysomnography should be applied in future work. Second, our study had a relatively small sample size and the gender was not well matched among the three subject groups. The reason why no female was found in the PD-EDS patients could be due to the inadequate sample size, but it could also be due to that male gender is indeed associated with higher ESS score ( ). We think that the female PD-EDS will be enrolled if the sample size was further enlarged. It is necessary to enlarge the sample size to prove the universality of the results in all genders, or to further analyze neural activity differences between male and female PD-EDS. Besides, to minimize bias, gender was analyzed as a covariate. Third, we interpreted the results cautiously owing to the rs-fMRI methodology   per se  , and the hypothesis that we proposed about the probable neural mechanism in PD related EDS should be verified by animal experiments. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our rs-fMRI study hypothesized the probable mechanism of the wake-promoting pathways and the DMN dysfunction underlying the EDS in male PD patients. It improved the understanding of this issue. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this article are available on request to the corresponding author, or directly at  . \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest.

Furthermore, GMV of the right middle frontal gyrus and cortical thickness of the right superior temporal gyrus were correlated with neurocognitive dysfunctions (e.g., MOCA and MMSE) in PD patients with MCI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis study provided further evidence that PD with MCI was associated with structural alternations of brain. Morphometric analysis focusing on the cortical and subcortical regions could be biomarkers of cognitive impairments in PD patients. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by using the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [ ]. The typical clinical hallmarks of PD are not only present motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, and postural instability) [ ], but also non-motor symptoms (e.g., depression, constipation, and olfactory deficit) [ ]. Cognitive impairments are common non-motor symptoms in patients with PD and frequently occur in the disease even prior to diagnosing the disease [ ,  ]. PD with mild cognitive impairments (MCI) is widely considered to be a higher risk of developing dementia [ ], which can arise in up to 80% of PD patients through the long term [ ] and can severely impact on the quality of life and increase the disability of PD patients [ ]. Identifying biomarkers of PD with MCI not only contribute to diagnosis, but also to disease progression by early therapeutic intervention. However, the underlying brain pathology leading to cognitive impairments in PD remain largely unknown. \n\nNeuroimaging has provided a promising approach to investigate the various risk factor and identify the brain structural features of PD patients with MCI, which would provide more insights to prevailing theories [ ,  ]. In this regard, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely applied to be a viable platform for identifying biomarkers of PD. More recently, investigators have used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate the morphometrics of the brain in PD patients. VBM is a voxel-wise imaging processing method of sMRI that allows detecting subtle morphological changes of gray matter across the whole brain and can quantify alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) in neurological disorders (e.g., PD) [ ]. Using the VBM analysis, several studies have investigated neuroanatomical alternations in PD and cognitive impairments, showing widespread atrophy of GMV in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices [ \u2013 ], and subcortical structures, including the insula, cingulate gyrus, hippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum [ ,  ,  ]. These results indicated that the implication of the fronto-temporo-limbic regions could be the main feature of cognitive impairments and could be potential biomarkers for in PD with MCI. \n\nHowever, only VBM analyses are possible not enough to detect early cortical changes in PD since it only detects voxels for which a specific predicted effect has less sensitivity for overlapping areas [ ]. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis can provide powerful tool for estimating cortical thickness of human cerebral cortex from sMRI data [ ]. The cortical thickness measurement by SBM is a more direct index of cortical morphology that is less susceptible to registration errors across different brains [ ] and is more sensitive to identify regional gray matter changes associated with PD. Several studies have described the cortical atrophy profile in PD by using SBM method. In a small sample, investigators have found that PD patients with MCI showed decreased cortical thickness in the right fronto-parietal regions and left temporo-occipital regions compared to PD patients without MCI [ ]. In a relatively large sample, investigators have reported that reduced cortical thickness mainly located in the parietal and temporal regions in PD patients with MCI compared to PD patients without MCI [ ]. Other researchers have made similar findings [ ]. In addition, neurotransmitter deficits, including dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine systems [ \u2013 ], have been implicated in PD. Brain regions rely on neuromodulation from the neurotransmitter systems to preserve normal function [ ]. The degeneration of neurotransmitters has been widely detected in cortical and subcortical areas of PD patients [ ] and suggested that the structural abnormalities of brain in PD are associated with the neurotransmitter deficits. \n\nMultimodal imaging approach could be useful for detecting sensitive alternations in PD patients with MCI. Specifically, VBM and SBM approaches seem to provide complementary information about structural changes, as they detect differences of gray matter at the voxel or volume level. The present study used these methods in conjunction to capture complementary aspects of brain pathological alternations in PD patients with MCI and to determine (1) whether different anatomical profiles exist that involve in gray matter patter of brain atrophy; (2) whether the different patterns of structural changes of brain differentiate the patients from the different subtypes and healthy controls; and (3) whether these brain structural measurements are associated with clinical and neurocognitive profiles. We hypothesized that multimodal information would allow us to gather additional knowledge on the characteristics of neurodegeneration of PD with MCI. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1 Participants \n  \nThe sample included 23 patients clinically diagnosed as PD with MCI and 23 patients diagnosed as PD without MCI. All participants in this study were recruited from the Department of Neurology, Sunshine Union Hospital (Weifang, China) between January 2019 and December 2020. The diagnosis of PD was clinically determined according to the UK Parkinson\u2019s Disease Brain Bank criteria [ ]. PD patients without MCI exhibit no impairments on cognitive abilities on any perception [ ]. MCI was diagnosed according to the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force, level I criteria [ ]: (1) in the circumstance of established PD, a gradual decrease in cognitive ability reported by either informant or the patient or observed by the clinician; (2) cognitive deficits that were insufficient to interfere substantially with functional independence; (3) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores <26, but related dementia do not reach clinical criteria [ ]. Besides, 23 healthy volunteers matched with age, sex, and education were recruited as healthy control group. Health controls had no cognitive complaints and normal cognition and neurologic examinations. All patients were taking antiparkinsonian drugs including different combinations of L-dopa, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. To standardize the doses, the L-dopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was calculated to express dose intensity of different antiparkinsonian drug [ ]. \n\nParticipants were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) brain lesion contraindication on MRI; (2) severe concomitant diseases that might influence brain metabolic alterations; (3) history of current psychiatric illness; (4) diagnosed dementia; and (5) moderate-to-severe head rest tremor; and (6) secondary Parkinsonism and Parkinson-plus syndrome. All diagnosis was managed by at least two professional neurologists. This study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Weifang Medical University and met the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation in this study. \n\n\n### 2.2 Clinical and neurocognitive measurements \n  \nThe demographic data of all participants including age, gender, and education were collected. The clinical data included disease duration of PD, the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS_III) score, and the modified Hoehn and Lahr (H&Y) score [ ]. Moreover, the cognitive function status was assessed by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) [ ] in each participant. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [ ] were further evaluated in PD patients and five cognitive domains were examined, including attention, memory, visuospatial function, language, and executive function. In addition, we collected the data on the patients\u2019 experienced seizures from clinical records. The demographic and clinical details of all participants are showed in  . \n   Demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive characteristics among the three groups.        \n\n### 2.3 Imaging data acquisition \n  \nThe MRI scans were acquired using a Siemens 3.0 T imaging system (Siemens, Munich, Germany) equipped with an 8-channel phased array head coil. The scanning protocol included a high-resolution 3- dimensional T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo volume with the following parameters: TR = 530 ms; TE = 3.42 ms; Field of view = 256 \u00d7 256 cm; flip angle = 15\u00b0; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256; 176 interleaved slices with no gap; voxel size = 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 1.1 mm . Head motion was minimized by using foam pads and by providing reassurance at the beginning of the scans. A quality check to exclude motion artifacts was executed by 2 researchers independently. \n\n\n### 2.4 Anatomic data analysis \n  \nThe anatomical images were processed and analyzed using the CAT12 toolbox implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;  ). CAT12 provides processing pipelines for both VBM and SBM modules, allowing us to perform all analyses with this software package. For the steps of processing and analysis, the parameters used default settings met the standard protocol ( ). This tool has been widely used and validated in morphometric studies in PD [ ,  ]. A two-step quality assurance was also included: first, all images were visually inspected for artifacts (prior to preprocessing); secondly, statistical quality control was performed for overall image quality and inter-subject homogeneity after segmentation. \n\nFor VBM analysis, the anatomical images were normalized to a standard template by the diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm and then segmented into three voxel classes: gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using partial volume segmentation with MAP approach. Then the regional gray matter volume differences were tested using modulated normalized gray matter maps. The abstracted gray matter maps were smoothed utilizing an 8 mm full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel and used for further analysis. For SBM analysis, the cortical thickness was estimated using a projection-based distance measure. The vertex-wise cortical thickness measures were resampled and smoothed by a 12 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. \n\n\n### 2.5 ROC analysis \n  \nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of brain structure measurements were used to decide the cutoff values that were associated with optimal sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing patients with PD with MCI from without MCI patients and healthy controls. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to compare the overall diagnostic performance of the indexes in all regions of interest (ROI). \n\n\n### 2.6 Correlations analysis \n  \nThe relationships between the brain structural variables and neurocognitive scores in PD patients with MCI were estimated by utilizing Pearson correlation coefficients. Two-tailed P < 0.05 was regarded to show significance. \n\n\n### 2.7 Statistical analysis \n  \nAn independent two-sample t-test was used to identify the regions with significant differences in each of both morphometric measures (GMV with VBM and cortical thickness with SBM) between the groups. Age, gender, education, experienced seizures, and ON medication state as covariates were included in the analysis (for VBM analyses, additionally added total intracranial volume as a covariate). P < 0.05 with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (size > 50) was considered statistically significant. \n\nThe demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive data were analyzed using the SPSS 20 Statistics software package (IBM Corporation, New York, EUA). Two-sample t-test was applied to compare disease duration, Levodopa does, and UPDRS-III scores between the two PD patient groups. Differences in age, education, and neurocognitive scores between all groups were analyzed with one-factor analyses of ANOVA following by post-hoc t-test and Bonferroni correction controlling for multiple comparisons. Categorical variables (gender, H &Y scores, and experienced seizures) were compared using chi-squared tests. P < 0.05 of All tests was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1 Demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive measurements of participants \n  \nThe demographic and clinical profiles of all participants are exhibited in  . There were no significant differences among the three groups for gender (P = 0.498), age (P = 0.111), education (P = 0.157). PD patients with MCI did not differ with PD patients without MCI in the disease duration (P = 0.316), UPDRS-III (P = 0.113), H &Y stages (P = 0.380), and experienced seizures (P = 0.295). However, MOCA (P < 0.001) and MMSE (P < 0.001) scores of the PD patients with MCI were significantly worse than that of PD patients without MCI and healthy controls, in line with the clinical diagnosis of each subtype. \n\n\n### 3.2 GMV differences between the groups \n  \nThe patients with PD had extensive structural changes of brain by VBM analysis. Specifically, PD patients with MCI showed reduced GMV in the frontal cortex (e.g., right inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus), while PD patients without MCI exhibited increased GMV in the putamen compared to healthy controls (  and  ). In addition, PD patients with MCI had decreased GMV in the right insula and right cerebellum relative to PD patients without MCI (  and  ). \n  \n(A) Differences of gray matter volume between PD patients with MCI and healthy controls; (B) Differences of gray matter volume between PD patients without MCI and healthy controls; (C) Differences of gray matter volume between PD patients with MCI and PD patients without MCI.

Discussion \n  \nThe present study investigated the structural changes of the brain in PD patients with MCI by combing VBM and SBM analyses. The results showed that the PD patients with MCI had extensive atrophy (e.g., reduced GMV and cortical thickness) in different region, including the frontal and temporal lobes, but also subcortical structures (e.g., putamen, insula, and cerebellum) relative to PD patients without MCI and healthy controls. Interestingly, the discrimination of PD with MCI from PD without MCI patients and healthy controls showed promise in detecting the structural changes of the fronto-temporal regions and subcortical structures. And these abnormal structural changes were associated with neurocognitive functional declines in PD patients with MCI. These results provide relatively comprehensive aspects of brain pathological alternations in PD patients with MCI and initially support our hypothesis. \n\nStructural neuroimaging helps investigate brain morphological features of PD patients with MCI. VBM analysis can detect subtle structural and neuropathological alterations in the whole brain and quantify alterations of GMV in PD [ ]. Gray matter loss has been reported in cortical and subcortical regions in PD patients [ ,  ]. We found that PD patients with MCI showed a more localized gray matter loss in the frontal cortex (e.g., middle frontal gyrus and inferior middle gyrus), parallel with previous studies [ \u2013 ]. The frontal regions involved in multiple important cognitive functions [ \u2013 ]. Gray matter abnormality in the frontal cortex was associated with impaired with executive function, attention, memory, and language abilities [ \u2013 ]. Therefore, it is worth noting that there was a significant correlation between gray matter atrophy of the frontal cortex (e.g., the middle frontal gyrus) and neurocognitive deficits (e.g., MOCA) in PD patient with MCI group, which indicates that lower GMV in the middle frontal gyrus suggests worse cognitive functions and a potential relationship between cognitive declines and structural loss in the brain region in PD. \n\nWe also found a decrease in gray matter signal in the frontal cortex extending to the insula and cerebellum (e.g., lobule VIII) in the PD patients with MCI. In addition to primary motor disorder, PD is well characterized by a number of non-motor symptoms rang from cognitive changes to sensory changes [ ]. The insula is highly interconnected with the basal ganlia [ ] and other cortical regions (e.g., the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices) [ ]. Thus, the insula can interact with multiple brain regions and plays a central role in directing cognitive processes [ ]. Studies have revealed that reduced GMV of the insula was significantly correlated with cognitive dysfunction in PD patients with MCI [ ,  ]. Imaging studies emphasize the distinct representation in the anterior (e.g., lobule IV-V) and posterior (e.g., lobule VIII) cerebellum, involved in motor control and cognitive function respectively [ ,  ]. VBM analysis indicated that reduced GMV in the cerebellum was associated with cognitive impairment in PD patients [ ]. Indeed, cognitive impairments together with the presence of motor deficits have been associated with atrophy of the cerebellum in PD patients [ ]. The results implied that PD patients with MCI had grapy matter atrophy from cortical extending to subcortical areas and related with cognitive status, which could be underlying neural architecture that contributed to cognitive deficits. \n\nThe increased GMV in the putamen in the PD patients with NCI was unexpected but was consistent with the previous studies [ ,  ], and may support the concept of striatum compensation in PD. The putamen is the striatal nucleus mainly linked with motor performance. The putamen and the motor areas are functional integrated during motor task performance [ ]. This region had enhanced functional connectivity with motor cortex (e.g., supplementary motor area) [ ,  ]. A disrupted pattern of the motor network could cause observable motor deficits in PD. The increased GMV in the putamen in PD patients with NCI may reflect a structural correlate of functional compensation for motor deficit, since higher volume of putamen was related better motor performance [ ]. \n\nMoreover, the cortical gray matter layer covering the surface of the brain, referred to as cortical thickness, is valuable measurements to assess the neuroanatomical patterns associated with neurodegenerative diseases [ ]. Neuroimaging studies has reported that PD patients with MCI had thinner cortical thickness in the temporal regions [ ,  ]. In line with these findings, we found reduced cortical thickness in the temporal lobe (e.g., middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus) in PD patients with MCI. The temporal lobe plays an important role in cognitive functions [ ]. Studies have demonstrated that there was a close correlation between the cortical thickness of temporal lobe and cognitive performance in PD patients [ ,  ]. Therefore, we observed that the cortical thickness of the temporal lobe (e.g., superior temporal gyrus) was correlated with cognitive measurement (e.g., MMSE) of PD patients with MCI. The cortical thinning of precuneus was also found in the PD patients with MCI. The cortical atrophy of the precuneus seems to contribute to cognitive declines in PD [ ]. The results support previous studies in which cognitive impairments in PD related to temporo-parietal surface area [ ,  ]. In addition, the occipital cortex (e.g., cuneus) implicated in PD patients with NCI showed relative decreased cortical thickness. The result was line with the previous studies [ ,  ]. The cuneus is one of the earliest regions to show cortical atrophy [ ] and was associated with motor symptoms in PD [ ]. These results suggested that there was evidence of widespread cortical brain changes in PD with MCI and may resulted in a series of clinical manifestations in the disease. \n\nInteresting, the altered brain structure, including the cortical regions (e.g., the frontal, and temporal lobes) and subcortical structures (e.g., the insula and cerebellum), were sensitive for differentiating the patients from different subtypes and healthy controls. Atrophy in the frontotemporal areas was found in patients with MCI compared to healthy controls [ ,  ], and cognitive impairments are associated with gray matter loss in the areas [ ]. Gray matter atrophy of cortical structures extending to the subcortical areas (e.g., insula and cerebellum) presents in the PD patients with MCI [ ,  ]. The subcortical structural deficits are functionally related to widespread cognitive functions [ ,  ]. The results confirmed that MCI was associated with widespread brain atrophy and indicated that the decreased gray matter volume or cortical thickness in these brain structures could be biomarkers for cognitive impairments in PD. \n\nThere were several limitations in the present study that need to be pointed out. First, the sample size of the current study was relatively small and could affect the statistical power of the results. A larger sample size is needed to validate the analysis. Second, the patients in the current sample were already taking anti-parkinsonian medication, the dopaminergic treatment may affect MRI measurements. Studying early stage and untreated PD patients using MRI could gain better understanding of the disease regardless of pharmacological treatment. Finally, this study focused only on gray matter. Combining gray matter and white matter features are key to provide a fuller framework for the underlying pathological processes in the PD population. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nBoth VBM and SBM methods provided complementary information on neurodegenerative changes in PD patients with MCI. PD patients with MCI had widespread structural alternations and these structural abnormalities may be associated with the pathophysiological basis of PD and could be biomarkers of MCI in PD. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9299333, "text_md5": "16defdc84a8d6c3fdb1c4a261b5d39df", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 89], "journal": [90, 98], "publication_year": [100, 104], "title": [115, 214], "keywords": [228, 228], "abstract": [241, 2524], "body": [2533, 26931]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35857782, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0269787", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9299333", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9299333"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9299333\">9299333</a>", "list_title": "PMC9299333  The structural changes of gray matter in Parkinson disease patients with mild cognitive impairments"}

The meta-analysis showed an overall sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval (CI): 76.7%-95.8%) and an overall specificity of 93% (95% CI: 80.0%-97.7%) to distinguish MSA-P from PD based on putaminal diffusivity. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nPutaminal diffusivity yields high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish clinically diagnosed patients with MSA-P from PD.

Depending on the predominant motor deficits, MSA is sub-divided into a parkinsonian (MSA-P) and a cerebellar (MSA-C) variant. Because MSA-P and PD share several signs and symptoms, they may be mistaken for one another on clinical examination [ ] with diagnostic error rates at the first clinical visit reaching 24%. [ ] Thus, an early and reliable diagnostic marker is a major unmet medical need. In recent years, several brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features have been described as specific for MSA and as helpful in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. These include atrophy of the putamen, pons, cerebellum and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), a dilated fourth ventricle, and various signal intensity alterations on routine MRI in MSA [ \u2013 ] whereas conventional MRI is typically normal in PD. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is of particular interest since it may serve as a quantifiable surrogate marker of neurodegeneration in MSA patients. [ ] In fact, increased putaminal diffusivity in DWI is considered a common and diagnostically valuable finding in patients with MSA. [ , ] Here, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of DWI in distinguishing MSA-P from PD. \n\n\n## Patients and methods \n  \nStudies on DWI were identified by two raters (SB, FK) through a systematic PubMed and Clarivate Analytics  Web of Science  Core Collection search. The following search term was used: (  \u201cmultiple system atrophy\u201d OR MSA OR \u201colivopontocerebellar atrophy\u201d OR OPCA OR \u201cstriatonigral degeneration\u201d OR SND OR \u201cShy-Drager syndrome\u201d) AND (\u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR MRI OR diffusion* OR diffusivity* OR DWI OR DTI)   ( , Search strategy). The term diffusivity used in this article includes Trace(D), averaged ADCs and mean diffusivity (MD). Full papers published from March 1986 through June 29, 2017 were considered. For further analysis papers had to satisfy the following, predefined eligibility criteria: (1) Papers were required to be published in English or German language. (2) MSA-P and PD patients were included in the study. (3) Studies were required to either report true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative rates or overall sample size and sensitivity and specificity values. Our meta-analysis complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ ] ( , Prisma Checklist). \n\nThe risk of bias in individual studies and across studies was performed with a tool for the quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy (QUADAS) [ ] ( , Quadas). The rating was performed by two independent raters (SB, FK) and discordant ratings were resolved in a discussion of the two initial raters and one additional uninvolved senior investigator. The QUADAS questionnaire includes fourteen items covering the following issues: reference standard, covered patient spectrum, verification bias, disease progression bias, review bias, incorporation bias, clinical review bias, test execution, indeterminate results and study withdrawals. Data extraction was done for each paper by the two independent investigators. For statistical analysis the following data were extracted from each of the studies: (1) Number of participants in each group, (2) sensitivity and specificity, or alternatively, true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative rates. Overall sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) curve approach as described previously [ ] and, in addition, both, a summary estimate which includes 95% confidence region and a forecast of the sensitivity and specificity which includes a 95% prediction region, are provided. In this method, the relationship between logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity in each study is quantified by the log diagnostic odds ratio (OR) and the results are used to estimate a summary ROC curve. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed by I  statistic, a parameter that provides a measure of the degree of inconsistency across studies describing the percentage of total variation attributable to heterogeneity, rather than chance. I  values up to 30%\u201340% are considered as low and up to 50%\u201360% as moderate heterogeneity. [ ] Statistical analysis was performed using STATA (StataCorp 2007, Stata Statistical Software, Release 14.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) exploiting the commands METANDI and MIDAS. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 1678 papers were identified by the initial PubMed and Clarivate Analytics  Web of Science  Core Collection search. After review of the abstracts, and removal of 1118 duplicates, 109 publications were selected for further review of the full texts. Only 9 studies satisfied the predefined criteria and were deemed relevant. A detailed flow chart of the review process is shown in  . The characteristics of the nine studies [ \u2013 ] included in this study are presented in  . \n   Prisma 2009 flow diagram showing an overview of study selection.       Overview of eligible studies evaluating diffusivity in different brain regions.        \nA sufficient number of studies to conduct a meta-analysis was published only for overall putaminal diffusivity measurements. Data from 127 MSA-P patients and 262 PD patients were analysed. Overall sensitivity was 90% (95% confidence interval: 76.7%\u201395.8%) and an overall specificity was 93% (95% confidence interval: 80.0%\u201397.7%) to discriminate MSA-P from PD patients ( ). Excellent positive and negative likelihood ratios of 12.43 (3.97\u201338.92) and 0.11 (0.05\u20130.28), respectively, were observed. There was substantial between-study heterogeneity as suggested by I  score of 66.13 and 78.82 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. \n  \nA: Overall sensitivity and B: overall specificity of putaminal diffusivity to discriminate MSA-P from PD. C: hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic (HSROC) curve plot demonstrating putaminal diffusivity accuracy to distinguish between MSA-P and PD in all 9 studies. The summary point shows overall sensitivity and specificity over the studies. \n  \nResults of DWI measurements in five additional brain regions were reported in the literature. Nicoletti et al. were able to discriminate MSA-P from PD with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% based on measuring diffusivity in the MCP. [ ] Following this approach, Chung et al. were able to replicate the excellent specificity but found a lower sensitivity to differentiate MSA-P from PD (sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 100%, respectively). [ ] Analysis of the caudate nucleus also revealed a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 94% comparing MSA-P and PD. [ ] Another study also measured diffusivity in the globus pallidus where sensitivity and specificity reached 63% and 93% for discriminating MSA-P from PD. [ ] Ito et al. performed analyses in the pons to differentiate MSA-P from PD with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% each. [ ] Two further studies described measurements in the cerebellum. Sensitivity ranged from 60% to 91% and specificity from 88% to 64%. [ , ] Moreover, magnetic field strength, slice thickness and interslice gap varied between studies. Two studies used 3T field strength, [ , ] other six studies used 1,5T field strength [ , , , , , ] and one used both.[ ] Slice thickness varied from 2 mm to 6 mm and interslice gap varied from 0 mm up to 1.5 mm. A detailed overview is provided in  . \n\nAll studies used established diagnostic criteria as a reference standard. Five out of nine studies included only probable MSA according to the current Consensus Criteria, the other studies included probable and possible MSA cases.[ ] Five out of nine studies (56%) reported the method of patient recruitment and six out of nine (67%) reported the blinding status. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis shows that assessment of putaminal diffusivity on high-field DWI is a useful imaging technique to discriminate MSA-P from PD with overall sensitivity of 90% and overall specificity of 93%. \n\nPutaminal diffusivity changes in MSA-P seem to correspond to prominent neuronal loss in the putamen in this disorder. Since diffusivity is based on hydrogen motility, structural damage in the putamen would lead to enhanced diffusivity [ ] which can indeed be detected already in early disease stages in MSA-P patients. [ , , ] Although normal aging may also affect diffusion tensor imaging, [ ] none of the studies assessed here was confounded by age differences between study groups. \n\nOur meta-analysis showed substantial between-study heterogeneity. Several factors might contribute to this variability: (1) slice thickness and interslice gap varied considerably between the studies included in this meta-analysis and it appears natural that a thinner slice thickness and a smaller inter-slice gap provides better diffusivity read-outs. (2) Differences in size and placement of the region of interests (ROIs) may have also influenced results. While some authors determined diffusivity in the putamen others restricted their ROIs to the posterior putamen. A standardized placement of the ROIs could be helpful in harmonizing results among different study sites. (3) Another potential source of variability arise from the used ROI placement procedure, i.e. automated atlas based definition of ROI or manual delineation of the ROI. In the present meta-analysis eight out of nine studies used manually placed ROIs and it remains to be studied which method provides better test-retest reliability. Magnetic field strength varied between the included studies from 1.5 T to 3 T. In total six studies used 1.5 T [ , , , , , ]], two used 3T [ , ]] and one used both field strengths [ ]]. However, it is unlikely that this circumstance influenced the results of our meta-analysis since diffusion tensor do not depend directly on the magnetic field and can thus be measured and directly compared between high- and low-field acquisitions. In fact, water diffusion in a given space is the same at 1.5, 3.0 and even 7.0 T [ ]. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that none of the patients in any study had a post-mortem confirmed diagnosis. As clinical diagnostic certainty increases with disease progression, most of the studies have included patients in advanced disease stages, thus making the clinical diagnosis of patients more reliable. Other studies, having also included patients in earlier disease stages and followed patients clinically for at least 1 year to optimise diagnostic certainty. [ , ] Nevertheless, we cannot rule out clinical misclassification in some instances, but this is an inherent problem in clinical biomarker research in neurodegenerative parkinsonism. However all studies analysed here have used established diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of MSA-P. [ ] \n\nThree studies compared the diagnostic value of striatal ADCs or putaminal diffusivity to either dopamine D2 receptor binding IBZM-SPECT ([132-I]-iodobenzamide\u2014single-photon emission computed tomography), [ ] cardiac MIBG ([132-I]-meta-iodobenzylguanidine uptake) [ ] or 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). [ ] Putaminal diffusivity measures were more accurate as compared with IBZM-SPECT, cardiac MIBG and FDG-PET imaging. \n\nIn summary, DWI is easy to implement in routine MRI protocols. Based on this meta-analysis, putaminal diffusivity on DWI has excellent sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MSA-P from PD in clinically established cases, nevertheless, these results must be considered sober. Standardized MRI Protocols, harmonized DWI sequenzes and ROIs are needed to increase the inter-scanner and inter-site comparability. Further studies which directly compare different ROI placements are another important area of future research, also further studies comparing different methods are needed. Finally, all studies included in this meta-analysis analysed patients with an established clinical diagnosis, hence, multicenter imaging studies in patients with newly diagnosed parkinsonism with harmonized MR protocols and long-term clinical follow-up are highly warranted to inform us about the diagnostic accuracy of DWI in early disease stages when clinical diagnosis is often inaccurate. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5747439, "text_md5": "ff3aa9619694d6c0c5e912991d06c1e6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 137], "journal": [138, 146], "publication_year": [148, 152], "title": [163, 313], "keywords": [327, 327], "abstract": [340, 2299], "body": [2308, 14758]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 29287113, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0189897", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747439", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5747439"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747439\">5747439</a>", "list_title": "PMC5747439  Diffusion-weighted MRI distinguishes Parkinson disease from the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy: A systematic review and meta-analysis"}

MCI can progress and convert to dementia in advanced stages, creating significant disability and reduced quality of life. The primary pathological substrate for cognitive decline in PD is unclear, and there are no reliable biomarkers predicting the risk of conversion to dementia. A subgroup of PD patients with visual hallucinations may display more rapid conversion to dementia, suggesting that regional markers of visuoperceptual dysfunction may be sensitive to pathologic density in posterior cortical regions. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThe purpose of this project is to characterize PD-MCI and evaluate the utility of genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive outcomes with a prospective longitudinal study. We will evaluate whether accelerated cognitive progression may be reflected in biomarkers of early posterior cortical changes reflective of \u03b1-synuclein deposition. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe will evaluate a cohort of early-stage PD patients with the following methods to predict cognitive progression: (1) serial neuropsychological evaluations including detailed visuoperceptual functioning across 4 years; (2) genetic analysis of   SNCA   (\u03b1-synuclein),   MAPT   (microtubule-associated tau), and   APOE   (apolipoprotein E); (3) an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm of object recognition memory; and (4) anatomical and regional brain activation changes (resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging) across 4 years. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe project received funding from the National Institutes of Health in August 2017, and data collection began in February 2018. Enrollment is ongoing, and subjects will be evaluated annually for 4 years extended across a 5-year project including data analysis and image processing. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nCognitive, genetic, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging will characterize neural network changes predictive of cognitive progression in PD across 4 years. Identification of biomarkers with sensitivity for early prediction and estimation of risk for conversion to dementia in PD will pave the way for effective intervention with neuroprotective therapies during the critical stage when treatment can have the greatest impact. \n\n\n## International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID) \n  \nDERR1-10.2196/12870 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Background \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive movement deficits and is caused by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and deposition of \u03b1-synuclein in intraneuronal Lewy body (LB) inclusions [ ]. Nonmotor features can characterize the earliest phase of the disease even before clinical motor impairment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prominent nonmotor feature that is present early in the disease process and increases over time, eventually converting to dementia (Parkinson disease dementia [PDD]). Follow-up studies reveal that MCI is present in one-third of patients and progresses to PDD, with conversion greater than 80% after 15 to 20 years [ , ]. Prospective longitudinal studies demonstrate that PDD is common, with a 4-year prevalence 3 times higher than the general population [ , ]. However, dementia onset is variable, with a subset of patients demonstrating rapid conversion, resulting in significant disability and poor quality of life [ , , ]. The neural and pathophysiologic mechanisms predicting rates of PD progression remain poorly understood and are key research priorities. Biomarkers signaling risk for PDD will facilitate intervention during early therapeutic windows, thus optimizing the chances of slowing progression. \n\nEarly cognitive deficits in PD have been characterized as executive and considered to be related to reductions in frontostriatal activity, suggesting a dopaminergic substrate [ ]. However, characterization of MCI in early PD has revealed extensive deficits outside the executive domain and is not fully explained by dopamine depletion alone [ , ]. Therefore, identification of early reliable biomarkers that are predictive of risk for dementia conversion will require models of PD-MCI that focus on markers outside of the dopaminergic network. Widespread distribution of dopamine receptors in the neocortex is well recognized, with a rostrocaudal dopamine receptor gradient with the highest receptor densities in the prefrontal cortex and lowest densities in the occipital regions [ ]. Therefore, biomarkers targeting posterior cortical changes may be more reliable for earlier prediction. \n\nThere is growing evidence of the presence of extranigral pathology that occurs before dopamine depletion. Multiple pathologies are linked to cognitive deficits in PD, including cholinergic, dopaminergic, and diffuse cortical LBs associated with \u03b1-synuclein, tau, and Alzheimer disease (AD)\u2013like lesions of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques [ , ]. PD shares a common neuropathological pattern to LBD and overlaps partially with AD, complicating early diagnosis based on cognitive profiles [ ]. Although the spread of \u03b1-synuclein is the strongest correlate of PDD, up to 50% of patients also develop sufficient amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles for a secondary diagnosis of AD [ ]. Thus, these pathologies may act synergistically to confer a worse prognosis. \n\nPatients with parkinsonism with cognitive deficits in the first year are diagnosed with Lewy body disease (LBD), whereas those with cognitive deficits after motor deficits are diagnosed with PDD. Although the main features of PDD and LBD are similar (visual hallucinations, visuospatial deficits, attention and executive deficits, and variable memory deficits with parkinsonism), controversy still exists as to whether PDD and LBD are distinct entities. It is conceivable that they represent 2 points on a continuum, with the type and degree of concurrent pathology influencing the timing and rate of cognitive decline [ ]. LB inclusions in neocortical and paralimbic regions in PD are predictive of the rate of cognitive decline and memory and visuoconstructional deficits [ ]. This implies that the density of \u03b1-synuclein and concurrent amyloid-\u03b2 could act as modulators in the relative timing of cognitive decline and may predict rates of cognitive progression [ ]. This is supported by parietal and superior temporal cortical atrophy in early PD-MCI relative to late-onset cognitive decline in PD, even in the absence of cognitive differences [ ]. This suggests that pathological burden in parietotemporal regions is greater in PD with early-onset cognitive decline [ ]. To advance therapeutics targeting nonmotor features and determine whether PDD and LBD are distinct disorders, it is essential to determine whether the pathology responsible for early deficits also has a synergistic role in dementia conversion. \n\nCurrent studies looking at different types of biomarkers suggest different possible contributors to PDD, but findings have been inconsistent across studies [ ]. Understanding the relationships between genetic risk factors for distinct pathologies and their resultant clinical presentation in PD is crucial for the development of disease-modifying interventions. Evaluating early cognitive deficits in PD and markers of future cognitive progression will shed light on whether PD pathology progresses in a consistent, expected pattern. Prospective longitudinal studies are essential to identify the initial cognitive symptoms and temporal pattern of atrophy and neural progression predictive of outcomes [ , ]   .   Thus, based on the models of pathological staging and anticipated sequence resulting in cognitive decline, accelerated cognitive progression may be reflected in biomarkers of early posterior cortical changes reflective of \u03b1-synuclein [ ]. \n\nCognitive profiles provide an index of staging of neuroanatomic regions, reflecting density and distribution of pathologic burden. Symptoms of visual hallucinations are associated with posterior cortical involvement and predict 75% conversion to PDD in 2.5 years, with widespread atrophy providing critical clues for biomarker identification [ ]. Although visual hallucinations are specific to cognitive decline in PDD, they are not sensitive, given the low incidence of reporting by patients. Thus, the detection of associated visuoperceptual deficits may improve prediction of posterior cortical pathology and future cognitive decline. \n\n\n### Objectives \n  \nThe long-term objectives of this study are the investigation of the predictive validity of early cognitive profiles in PD and identification of genetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers signaling more rapid conversion to dementia. In this study, we will target the posterior cortex as a reliable marker of pathologic burden based on the proposed caudal-rostral progression of \u03b1-synuclein and the rostrocaudal dopamine gradient, with lower occipital receptor density eliminating the effects of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). Our hypothesis, based on the models of pathologic staging, is that earlier involvement of posterior cortical regions and the dorsal and ventral visual pathways (with or without visual hallucinations) are reliable markers for cognitive progression. To date, there have been few longitudinal and MRI studies focused on biomarker identification signaling cognitive progression in PD. Neuroimaging techniques offer promise in detecting neuronal changes before performance decrements and identifying biomarkers of accelerated cognitive progression. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Overview \n  \nThe primary objective is to investigate the prognostic value of PD-MCI subtypes and genetic variation in predicting the relative risk for progression to dementia utilizing a prospective longitudinal cohort followed for over 4 years.   and   provide a detailed screening assessment and dependent study measures and timeline. The objectives will be addressed through the following methods: (1) neuropsychological evaluations and novel visuoperceptual tasks will be given annually for 4 years to nondemented PD patients (at baseline), and the predictive validity of visuoperceptual cognitive deficits relative to memory and executive deficits and ideal cutoffs (\u22121.5 vs \u22122 SD) for reliable prediction will be determined; (2) an exploratory genetic analysis of how variations in the   SNCA   (\u03b1-synuclein),   MAPT   (microtubule-associated tau), and   APOE   (apolipoprotein E) genes influence cognitive progression will be conducted; (3) the utility of task-activated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a probe for the risk for cognitive progression will examine altered posterior cortical networks before clinical manifestation; and (4) the anatomical and regional brain activation patterns predictive of cognitive progression will be determined. \n\nScreening and recruitment will be conducted as outlined with year of testing denoted by 1-4. If we have attrition related to completing the MRI protocol or patients do not return for years 2-4, we will recruit additional patients in year 3 to ensure adequate numbers of patients and converters. The fifth year will be utilized for completion of data collection to account for attrition, image processing, and data analysis. \n\n\n### Patients \n  \nNondemented idiopathic PD patients will be recruited and evaluated in the   on   medication state. The severity of PD will be graded by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) motor section [ ]. Subjects will be asked to provide consent in accordance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies and protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations, and IRB approval has been obtained from the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), School of Medicine. We will recruit 120 PD patients who will be evaluated annually for 4 years on neuropsychological and MRI measures in a 5-year study. Patients will be recruited from the University of Maryland School of Medicine as well as through other advertisements to recruit patients from surrounding areas. Our goal is to complete 100 patients, so we will overrecruit because of anticipated attrition. Potential subjects will be screened, and information regarding the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), mood, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be acquired to determine the study eligibility [ , ]. The principal investigator is a clinical neuropsychologist who will review the study and the inclusion criteria and will confirm the diagnosis with the study neurologist who will examine all the patients. \n\n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nGeneral and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for both PD patients and controls are reviewed below. \n\nGeneral criteria: (1) age 50 to 77 years to avoid early-onset PD and (2) no evidence of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II >18 is predictive in mild PD) [ ]. \n\nPD criteria: (1) Diagnosis of idiopathic PD based on the presence of 2 cardinal features [ ], (2) improvement with DRT, (3) minimal or mild disease severity based on the Hoehn and Yahr rating scale of <2.5 and motor UPDRS <30   on   DRT medications [ ], and (4) normal or MCI cognition based on MoCA screening (>21) at baseline [ ]. \n\n\n### Exclusion Criteria \n  \n(1) Other neurologic disorder or stroke; (2) dementia (MoCA <21 at baseline) or functional decline on instrumental ADLs related to cognitive deficits [ ]; (3) major psychiatric disorder, including alcohol or substance abuse; (4) concurrent, unstable or serious medical condition; (5) major head trauma; (6) chronic use of psychoactive medications; (7) significant dyskinesia on neurological examination; (8) tremor greater than 2 for upper extremities and head tremor greater than 1 based on the MDS-UPDRS on neurological examination; and (9) claustrophobia, pacemaker, neurostimulator, or other implants or other factors that interfere with the ability to lay still in the MRI scanner for 1 hour. \n\n\n### Timeline for Schedule of Assessments \n  \nStudy subjects will be enrolled and evaluated annually across 4 years (see   for a detailed timeline of enrollment and schedule of assessments). Neuropsychological, behavioral, and neurological assessments, including the MD-UPDRS motor section III, will be conducted annually. Genetic samples and cognitive activation paradigm will only be conducted at year 1 and utilized as predictors of 4-year outcomes, whereas the remaining MRI measurements will be conducted annually ( ). \n\n#### Assessments \n  \n##### Neuropsychological Assessment \n  \nThe battery was selected based on the identified PD cognitive deficits and task force recommendations. The battery will include estimates of premorbid verbal intellectual functioning (American New Adult Reading Test) [ ], measures of both verbal and nonverbal memory and attention, and several executive tasks. Memory tests will use equivalent alternative forms across years 1 to 4 to control for practice effects [ ]. \n  \nScreening, assessment, and dependent study measures. \n    \nTimeline of enrollment and schedule of assessments. \n    \n\n##### Attention \n  \nVisual attention will be evaluated with the Stroop Color-Word test [ ], whereas auditory working memory will be evaluated by the Letter-Number Sequencing and auditory Digit Span backward and forward from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u2013Fourth Edition [ ]. \n\n\n##### Executive Tasks \n  \nA computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task [ ] and the Delis Kaplan Executive Functions Scale (Trails and Tower of London) with demonstrated reliability and validity in measuring executive functions will be given [ ]. \n\n\n##### Language \n  \nLanguage will be assessed by the Boston Naming Test [ ] and phonemic and semantic fluency. \n\n\n##### Memory Tasks \n  \nThe Hopkins Verbal Learning Test [ , ] for verbal memory and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test [ ] will both be utilized in alternative forms across the years  .  \n\n\n##### Sensorimotor Tasks \n  \nMotor tasks of speed, precision, and dexterity (finger tapping and grooved pegboard) will be evaluated bilaterally [ ]. \n\n\n##### Other Measures \n  \nOther measures include evaluation of hallucinations (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [ ] and thought disorder item UPDRS-TD [ ]), mood and anxiety (BDI-II; Beck Anxiety Inventory) [ , ], quality of life (The Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39]) [ ], and ADLs with the Adelaide Activities Profile, which focuses on instrumental activities [ ]. \n\n\n##### Visuoperceptual Tasks \n  \nThe Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) task and Benton Visual Form Discrimination tasks will measure visual orientation [ ] and visuoperceptual discrimination [ ]. An abbreviated version of the Visual Object and Space Perception battery will be given to evaluate silhouettes presented in unusual perspectives and progressive silhouettes as well as decision of objects presented in rotated manners [ ]. On the basis of the tasks previously developed in our laboratory in early PD, subjects will be evaluated on   visuoperceptual judgments of equidistance   (judging line lengths and width intervals). Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems) [ ] will present the perceptual stimuli (4-second presentation). The first task requires   length estimation   of 2 lines in either a vertical or a horizontal orientation and evaluation of whether they are the   same   or   different  . The second task,   width interval estimation  , compares 2 interval spaces between 3 horizontal lines to determine if they are the   same   or   different  . Subject responses will be entered as same, different, or a miss (failure to respond) by the experimenter. Each task contains 24 trials, randomized for each subject and varied by 3 line lengths (4, 8, and 12 cm) and 4 levels of difficulty (same, easy, difficult, and very difficult). \n\n\n\n\n### Genotyping \n  \nGenetic variations will be explored relative to cognitive and neuroimaging progression and 4-year outcomes to determine the association with cognitive progression. Genotyping for   SNCA   rs356219,   MAPT   H1/H2 haplotypes (rs1800547)   ,   and   APOE \u025b2/\u025b3/\u025b4   alleles (rs429358 and rs7412) will be conducted using DNA extracted from saliva and performed with TaqMan assays. TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism assays will extract DNA from saliva samples, and they have been demonstrated to yield comparable results to blood samples but eliminate the need for an invasive procedure, reduce risk, and increase recruitment. To ensure optimal analysis and avoid false-positive amplifications, at least 2 no-template controls will be used per assay. Assays will be conducted by the UMB Center for Innovative Biomedical Resources genetics core facilities. \n\n\n### Imaging Protocol \n  \nImaging is performed on a Siemens PRISMA 3T MRI scanner using a 64-channel receive head coil. After obtaining scout images in all 3 planes, a high-resolution volumetric sagittal T1-weighted-MPRAGE (TE=2.94 ms, TR=2300 ms, TI=900 ms, flip angle=9 , 1-mm isotropic resolution) is obtained, which serves as the anatomical reference from which regional and whole-brain volumes and cortical thickness are extracted. The total acquisition time for MPRAGE is 5 min and 30 s. Furthermore, 6 sets of fMRI data are then obtained in 2 phases. During the first phase, 2 encoding runs are performed, followed by 2 immediate recall acquisitions. After a delay of 18 min, the second phase consisting of 2 delayed-recall fMRI acquisitions is obtained (see Cognitive Activation Paradigm,  ). Data for fMRI are obtained using a 2-dimensional multiband single-shot T2*-weighted, echo-planar imaging sequence (TE=30 ms, TR=2000 ms, Flip 90 , 2-mm isotropic resolution) with a multiband acceleration factor of 4 covering the entire brain in the axial plane [ - ]. Between the immediate-recall and delayed-recall sessions, both diffusion tensor data and rs-fMRI data are acquired. The diffusion tensor images are obtained using a multiband double-refocused spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (TE=78 ms, TR=3000 ms) using b-values of 0 and 2500 s/mm  and uniformly sampling the sphere in 136 directions with 5 b=0 acquisitions at an isotropic resolution of 2 mm for a total acquisition time of 7 min and 19 s. rs-fMRI data are obtained using a T2* gradient echo EPI sequence (TE=30 ms, TR=2000 ms; 300 volumes) also at an isotropic resolution of 2 mm for a total acquisition time of 10 min and 12 s. In addition, fast spin echo-based T2-weighted images (TE=100 ms, TR=5340 ms) and FLAIR images (TE=83 ms, TR=9000 ms; TI=2500 ms) are also obtained. \n\nfMRI and rs-fMRI data will be preprocessed using both AFNI and SPM. Preprocessing includes slice timing correction, registration of all the volumes to the first volume of the time series, spatial blurring (6 mm FWHM), and band-pass filtering (0.01 Hz<f<0.1 Hz). Functional MRI data will be spatially normalized to a common Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. The global signal from the mean BOLD time series from the whole brain mask and the 6 motion-correction parameters will be used as regressors in the model to remove the variance related to nonneuronal contributions and motion. \n  \nCognitive activation memory paradigm. rs-fMRI: resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; DTI: Diffusion Tensor Imaging. \n  \n\n### Cognitive Activation Paradigm \n  \nAn fMRI event-related object memory task using fractal images will measure BOLD response in PD patients at baseline. Stimuli are based on the object and spatial memory study by Floel et al [ ]. Stimuli will be presented on a screen and synchronized with the scanner via an optic relay triggered by the radiofrequency pulse, and responses will be acquired through Presentation software. The paradigm will consist of 6 BOLD sequences (2 for encoding, 2 for immediate recall, and 2 for delayed recall), but with an 18-min delay when structural and rs-fMRI data are acquired ( ). During object encoding, subjects will view 48 images presented in a fixed block across 2 runs. Each run will include 24 designs presented across 2 trials in 4 blocks of 12 images. Stimulus presentation is 4 seconds for each image (48 secs for each block), followed by 2 baseline fixations separated by repeating 2 figures for 6 times (96 secs) between each of the blocks. Each run will last 8 min and 30 seconds for the encoding condition. \n\nAn event-related fMRI paradigm will evaluate immediate and delayed recognition of the 48 designs based on discrimination from 48 foils. Each of the recognition trials will consist of 2 runs with variable 4- to 12-second fixations between each stimulus presented for 4 seconds (runs last 7-8 min and 32 secs). Stimulus presentation order and interstimulus intervals will be randomized across 14 different experiments. Subjects will be instructed to look at the designs presented on the screen and recall whether the designs are old designs (targets) or new designs (foils). Responses and reaction times will be recorded by pressing the key press with their index finger for   yes   or pressing their middle finger for   no  . Data will be analyzed separately for   accurate  ,   inaccurate  , and   missed responses  . Following encoding, the immediate recognition runs will be collected. An 18-min delay when structural and rs-fMRI are conducted will precede the delayed recognition recall condition. \n\n\n### Resting-State and Voxel-Based Morphometry \n  \n#### Cortical Thickness \n  \nMPRAGE images will be processed using the pipeline established in Free Surfer [ ]. Cortical thickness from various regions of interest (ROIs) is then determined as the mean of difference between WM and pial surfaces. We will generate an average surface map to which each surface map will be aligned followed by generation of a group difference map. \n\n\n#### Connectivity Analysis \n  \nFollowing the preprocessing steps as described earlier, we will register all the 300 volumes collected for rs-fMRI to the first volume of the time series. As differential head motion between groups can introduce artifacts, we will equate the PD and control groups with a   scrubbing   procedure to remove volumes compromised by motion [ ]. The resting-state series will then be registered to the high-resolution structural images, spatially normalized to standard space using the MNI atlas, and resampled to a spatial resolution of 2.0 mm isotropic and then spatially blurred using a 5-mm Gaussian kernel. The segmented masks (GM, WM, and CSF) created as part of the measurement for cortical atrophy will account for time series variance from the nonneuronal contributions of CSF and WM. In addition, the 6 standard movement parameters from registration will be regressed out of the 4-dimensional data. Graph-theoretic analysis on selected ROIs that are relevant to PD cognition based on our hypotheses will be performed and expanded to a more global approach using Graph Analysis Toolbox (GAT) [ ]. The ROI method will consider regions such as   caudate, putamen, cingulate, orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior and inferior parietal, posterior and anterior visual cortex, superior and medial temporal.   Pairwise correlations between mean BOLD time series using ROIs will be utilized to create functional connectivity matrix followed by the Fisher transformation to z score association matrix. Various topological features of the networks will be captured at the global and regional level such as total connectivity, normalized clustering coefficient, normalized path length, density, global efficiency, and betweenness centrality [ ]. Between-group comparisons will be made using a 2-sample   t   test after correcting for multiple comparisons with significance set at   P  <.05. To determine the relationship of the network topology with cognition, we will correlate all subtests of the neuropsychological and visuoperceptual assessments using the Pearson correlation coefficient comparing PD with normal cognition across 4 years and PD with cognitive progression. \n\nUsing a more global approach, we will perform cortical/subcortical parcellation to define 200 brain regions to identify and understand the influence of other networks on PD network topology and to assess whether taking such interactions into account influences predictions in PD outcomes. The extracted time courses from each of these regions will be correlated against one another to produce a 200\u00d7200 adjacency (correlation) matrix, followed by the Fischer transformation to z score association matrix. Similar metrics will be extracted as in the case of the limited ROIs described above. \n\nActivation maps from fMRI will be analyzed using statistical parametric methods, and contrasts will be conducted using multiple regression with the General Linear Model, allowing for multiple predictors to be built into the model [ ]. Regressors representing the experimental conditions of interest will be modeled with a hemodynamic response function and entered into the multiple regression analysis using both fixed- and random-effects models. Whole-brain statistical analyses will be conducted, and statistical parametric maps will be generated to examine brain regions that differ in activation between the groups and conditions (encoding and immediate and delayed recall). These analyses will be performed in each group separately using a repeated-measures analysis of variance model and then between groups (PD and PD-MCI). We will inspect the entire brain for areas of activation, and areas will be considered significant if they exceed a threshold of q<.001 (False Discovery Rate). We will evaluate the relationship between brain activation and cognition inside and outside the scanner. \n\n\n\n### Statistical Analysis and Power \n  \nA sample of 120 PD patients is planned for this study. On the basis of the experience of longitudinal studies in PD, the attrition (mortality and loss to follow-up) is anticipated at 16% for 4 years. Thus, initial recruitment of 120 patients will yield about 100 subjects after 4 years. On the basis of published data, we estimate 70% PD-NC and 30% PD-MCI patients in our sample, and conversion rates of 60% from NC to MCI and 80% from MCI to PDD after 4 years. One of our primary goals is to evaluate progression patterns to determine time-specific differences between groups (NC vs MCI at baseline and PDD vs MCI, MCI vs NC, and PDD vs NC at year 4). Our study will have 80% power to detect medium-to-large average differences across time between the different groups under various within-subject correlations. In terms of predictive models for 4-year outcomes, our study will have 90% power to detect at least 0.86 area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for PDD conversion and 95% power to detect at least 0.74 AUROC for MCI at year 4. \n\nTo study differential cognitive progression patterns, generalized estimating equations will be used for describing the longitudinal trajectories of neuropsychological and visuoperceptual performances between PD-NC and MCI groups comparing baseline performance with different time points. The model will provide estimates of PD-MCI versus PD-NC differences at specific time points and longitudinally. Covariates such as age, UPDRS, and visual illusions or hallucinations will be added to the model to enable determination of adjusted differences. \n\nWe will investigate the prognostic value of baseline cognition in predicting relative risk for progression to PDD through a multiple logistic regression model. The best combination of baseline measures and covariates included in the prediction model will be selected by the elastic net procedure. Summary statistics of the AUROC will be used to evaluate the predictive power. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value will be calculated from the optimal threshold determined by the Youden index. The prediction models will be cross-validated by training and testing methodology. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe project received funding from the National Institutes of Health in August 2017, and data collection began in February 2018. Enrollment is ongoing, and subjects will be evaluated annually for 4 years extended across a 5-year project including data analysis and image processing. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Overview \n  \nCardinal features of idiopathic PD include motor symptoms attributed to dopaminergic depletion of the dorsal striatum. Nonmotor features of the disease such as cognitive impairment are common early in the disease process and can dominate in advanced stages, creating significant disability and poor quality of life. Follow-up studies reveal that MCI is present in one-third of the patients and can progress at variable rates to PDD. After 15 to 20 years, more than 80% of patients with MCI are diagnosed with PDD [ ]. However, the neural and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying variable cognitive deficits and their progression in PD remain poorly understood. Cognitive profiles in nondemented early-stage PD can be widespread, extending beyond expected frontostriatal circuitry. Furthermore, DRT can have a paradoxical effect on attention and memory, with evidence for overdosing of nondepleted ventral striatal circuits early in the disease process, suggesting that these deficits may be unreliable predictors of cognitive progression [ , ]. PD-MCI is heterogeneous in clinical presentation (executive, memory, and visuospatial), reflecting the presence of extranigral pathology in addition to dopamine. The co-occurrence of LB inclusions (\u03b1-synuclein) and Alzheimer pathology (amyloid-\u03b2 and tau) is essential for the development of PDD, but the neurobiological basis of PD-MCI is unknown. Density of amyloid-\u03b2 is predictive of neocortical atrophy, but how the predominate pathology in PDD (\u03b1-synuclein) influences clinical features or signals conversion to dementia is unclear. \n\nOur central hypothesis, based on models of pathologic staging, is that earlier involvement of posterior cortical regions and the dorsal and ventral visual pathways (with or without the presence of visual hallucinations) are reliable markers for future cognitive progression. Our strategy toward this overarching goal is to characterize cognitive, genetic, and neural network progression in PD over a 4-year period. This allows evaluation of variable timing of onset and accelerated rates of cognitive progression, reflecting a deviation from expected stages of progression. Prospective longitudinal studies are essential to identify the initial cognitive symptoms and temporal pattern of atrophy and neural progression predictive of outcomes. These studies have been lacking, with overreliance on cross-sectional motor and pathological dementia studies in PD [ , ]. \n\nOur project is built on the most recent advances in scientific understanding of cognitive, genetic, and neural markers of PD progression. We will translate this information to clinical applications through the development and validation of novel cognitive and neuroimaging markers that signal onset of PDD. Although the visuoperceptual and posterior cortical changes may not predict conversion in all patients, our model allows simultaneous measurement of other cognitive domains and associated brain regions, thus allowing verification of alternative hypotheses and combinations of cognitive domains. \n\n\n### Cognitive Progression in Parkinson Disease \n  \nThe Movement Disorder Task Force guidelines for the diagnosis of PD-MCI are focused on identifying the earliest stage of cognitive impairment by providing PD-specific criteria [ , ]. The heterogeneity in PD-MCI is recognized, with nonamnestic subtype as the most common, but few studies have evaluated PD-MCI subtype and conversion to PDD. In the few studies conducted, many different subtypes have been implicated [ ]. In a 5-year longitudinal study, posterior cortical cognitive deficits were associated with PDD [ ]. We aim to establish whether early cognitive and genetic profiles and neural network changes before clinical manifestation can be used for the estimation of pathological burden to assess risk for rapid cognitive progression. \n\n\n### Genotyping Cognitive Risk in Parkinson Disease \n  \nThere is contradictory evidence regarding \u03b1-synuclein levels in PD and how expression levels might be modified by genetic variability [ ]. As blood \u03b1-synuclein levels may not be sensitive early in PD, measures of genetic variation serving a regulatory role might be useful for early prediction [ ]. Variation in the SNCA gene has demonstrated influences on blood and brain and likely influences the expression of \u03b1-synuclein in PD expressed by genotype rs356219 [ , ]. Although APOE status does not appear to be associated with PD [ ] and findings have been inconsistent regarding PDD, 2 recent studies reported that the APOE   \u025b4   allele predicted cognitive deficits in PD [ ]. The MAPT H1 haplotype is a well-known risk factor for PD, but there have been contradictory findings as to whether it is a risk for rapid cognitive progression in PD [ ]. Genetic variation impacts the age of onset and disease risk, with   SNCA   and   MAPT   genes contributing to progression and cognitive impairment [ ]. There is also racial genetic variation influencing the risk of PD and presentation, although genetic variation impacting cognition has not been well investigated. \n\n\n### Task-Activated Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n  \nThis study will evaluate the utility of task-activated fMRI as a probe for the risk of cognitive progression by examining altered posterior cortical networks before clinical manifestation. It remains unclear whether PD-MCI profiles confer a higher risk of conversion to PDD. Frontal executive and posterior cortical cognitive functions have been considered as risks for conversion, whereas the amnestic memory has been a focus in AD prediction. Combining cognitive and neural biomarkers may improve the prediction of conversion to PDD [ ]. Task-activated fMRI offers promise for detecting activations during cognitive tasks to identify the salient aspects of subclinical impairment that are predictive of cognitive outcomes. There have been few fMRI biomarker investigations in PD, although 1 study identified overactivation in DLPFC and posterior parietal regions on a subclinical visuospatial task [ ]. However, the predictive nature of these findings is unclear. We have developed a novel fMRI paradigm that targets posterior cortical regions through visuospatial processing and also activates memory regions, allowing for the possibility of more than 1 cognitive profile predicting conversion. BOLD patterns during encoding and immediate and delayed recall of task-activated nonverbal memory will evaluate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (executive), medial temporal (memory), and occipito-parieto-temporal (visuospatial) activations as predictors for 4-year outcomes. We predict that greater percentage signal change in occipito-parieto-temporal regions during a visuospatial performance at baseline will predict cognitive progression in multiple cognitive domains. \n\n\n### Anatomical and Regional Brain Activation Patterns Predictive of Cognitive Progression \n  \nSignificant atrophy has been associated with transition from MCI to AD [ , ]. However, there is limited work on cortical thinning in early PD, and no longitudinal studies have evaluated cortical thickness measures as biomarkers signaling rapid cognitive progression in PD [ , ]. Critically important to prediction is evaluating differences in patterns of cortical atrophy based on the timing of onset of cognitive progression. This could reveal an anatomical basis for the timing of cognitive decline, thus elucidating the pathological burden in PD [ ]. \n\nThere is an increased interest in studying resting-state brain networks to try and understand interactions between disparate brain regions. Rs-fMRI measures the strength of functional interactions between brain regions based on temporal correlations of the spontaneous fluctuations in the resting-state BOLD signal, such that synchronous temporal changes in signal are functionally connected [ ]. Rs-fMRI has been used to test the efficiency and strength of large-scale neuronal networks in the absence of a task. Although rs-fMRI has revealed the natural history of amnestic MCI to AD, very little is known about its efficacy as a biomarker in PD [ , ]. Characterizing differences in PD will elucidate temporal changes in functional networks related to relative changes in frontal, medial-temporal, and posterior cortical regions with cognitive progression and provide neural insights into the timing of pathophysiological changes in PD. \n\nCortical thickness, voxel-based morphometry, and rs-fMRI will characterize the evolution of regional brain degeneration annually for 4 years in PD patients. We predict a higher rate of cortical thinning and decreased functional connectivity in occipito-parieto-temporal regions in PD patients with cognitive progression. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThis project will incorporate specific areas of innovation, including the use of predictive models; inclusion of novel fMRI biomarkers; segregation of motor, executive, and visuoperceptual task demands; and conceptualization of PD progression based on nonmotor features. Making predictions is a critical task in translational medicine and is of great importance for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response [ , ]. Our predictive model will provide a unique contribution by using cognitive, genetic, and neuroimaging markers to characterize cognition in PD. Previous neuroimaging investigations have focused on PET and SPECT, and there have been few task-activation paradigms developed for PD. The proposed project is innovative in establishing a combined cognitive and fMRI approach for early identification of risk for cognitive progression and to establish the phenotypes of PD connectome using graph theoretic analysis. The proposed project will contribute to a new conceptualization of neurodegeneration in PD. This new framework will include variable rates of onset and progression of both motor and nonmotor features, with recognition that pathology can deviate from expected stages and have accelerated progression. \n\n\n### Summary \n  \nThere are significant challenges in PD biomarker development with potential to advance therapeutics, in particular, related to nondopaminergic responsive features of PD. Study findings will address these challenges and provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms by characterizing heterogeneity in cognitive, genetic, and neural temporal progression. This will contribute to an altered conceptualization of PD and LBD neurodegeneration based on the timing of onset and progression of cognitive deficits relative to structural and functional changes. Currently, there is no reliable biomarker predictive of risk for rapid cognitive decline, and there have been few longitudinal studies of temporal progression. Identifying reliable biomarkers will aid in the early and accurate prediction of risk for PDD and provide objective monitoring and response to treatments in the earliest stage when therapies have their greatest impact. Identification of patients at risk for early cognitive progression will have a high impact on patient management strategies and will facilitate intervention at the earliest stage when treatments can have their greatest impact on progression. Study results will provide a foundation for the development of disease-modifying agents and preventative clinical trials. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6660119, "text_md5": "15e571d108e9862d96a6c8aabc75b0d0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 57], "journal": [58, 73], "publication_year": [75, 79], "title": [90, 246], "keywords": [260, 378], "abstract": [391, 2901], "body": [2910, 42310]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 31033450, "doi": "10.2196/12870", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6660119", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6660119"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6660119\">6660119</a>", "list_title": "PMC6660119  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers Predicting Cognitive Progression in Parkinson Disease: Protocol for a Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study"}

VY-AADC01 was delivered via bilateral, intraoperative MRI-guided putaminal infusions to 3 cohorts (n = 5 participants per cohort): cohort 1, \u22647.5 \u00d7 10  vector genomes (vg); cohort 2, \u22641.5 \u00d7 10  vg; cohort 3, \u22644.7 \u00d7 10  vg. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nNo serious adverse events (SAEs) attributed to VY-AADC01 were reported. All 4 non-vector\u2013related SAEs (atrial fibrillation and pulmonary embolism in 1 participant and 2 events of small bowel obstruction in another participant) resolved. Requirements for PD medications were reduced by 21%\u201330% in the 2 highest dose cohorts at 36 months. Standard measures of motor function (PD diary, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III \u201coff\u201d-medication and \u201con\u201d-medication scores), global impressions of improvement (Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, Patient Global Impression of Improvement), and quality of life (39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire) were stable or improved compared with baseline at 12, 24, and 36 months following VY-AADC01 administration across cohorts. \n\n\n## Discussions \n  \nVY-AADC01 and the surgical administration procedure were well-tolerated and resulted in stable or improved motor function and quality of life across cohorts, as well as reduced PD medication requirements in cohorts 2 and 3 over 3 years. \n\n\n## Trial Registration Information \n  \nNCT01973543. \n\n\n## Classification of Evidence \n  \nThis study provides Class IV evidence that, in patients with moderately advanced PD and motor fluctuations, putaminal infusion of VY-AADC01 is well tolerated and may improve motor function. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nParkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results in significant motor and nonmotor impairments.  Levodopa, converted to dopamine by  -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), is the most effective treatment for PD motor symptoms.  In PD, dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons that express AADC degenerate, resulting in progressive loss of AADC in nigrostriatal terminals in the putamen and reduced synthesis of dopamine from levodopa.  As PD progresses, escalating levodopa doses and adjunct medications are required to manage increasingly disabling symptoms, including motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. \n\nGene therapy may provide durable, possibly lifelong, clinical benefits in PD following a single administration.  Previous studies of gene therapies targeting the basal ganglia in PD have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies, but efficacy results have been mixed.  NBIb-1817 (VY-AADC01) is an experimental adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) gene therapy encoding the human AADC (hAADC) enzyme designed to increase dopamine production by delivering the   AADC   gene directly to the putamen,  where transduced cells are expected to express AADC, allowing for localized dopamine production from the prodrug levodopa. Resulting dopamine levels are expected to depend on levodopa dosing.  Another gene therapy approach using a lentiviral vector encoding the 3 enzymes required for endogenous dopamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, cyclohydrolase 1, and AADC) is also under development. \n\nPD-1101 was a phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation trial of VY-AADC01 delivered bilaterally to the putamen in participants with moderately advanced PD and motor fluctuations.  We report final 36-month data from PD-1101; interim safety and efficacy results have been published. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents \n  \nA detailed description of the methods used in PD-1101 has been published.  The trial protocol and participant informed consent forms were approved by the institutional review boards of the University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], the University of Pittsburgh, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The protocol was also reviewed and approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH; all participants provided written informed consent prior to trial participation. A data safety monitoring board reviewed safety data throughout the trial. The   identifier is NCT01973543. \n\n\n### Trial Design and Participants \n  \nPD-1101 was a phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation trial intended to provide Class IV evidence that, in patients with moderately advanced PD and motor fluctuations, putaminal infusion of VY-AADC01 is well tolerated and may improve motor function. Participants were enrolled at 2 clinical sites (UCSF and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [UPMC]) and received surgery between May 7, 2014, and December 9, 2016. Eligible participants were 40\u201370 years of age with moderately advanced PD and a history of responsiveness to dopaminergic therapy, disabling motor fluctuations despite optimal medical therapy, disease duration \u22655 years, modified Hoehn & Yahr (mH&Y) stage \u22652.5 \u201coff\u201d-medication, and a stable PD medication regimen for \u22654 weeks before screening. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed on  . By cohort, for cohort 1, 5/5 participants were treated and followed at UCSF; for cohort 2, 4 participants were treated and followed at UCSF and 1 at UPMC; and for cohort 3, 2 participants were treated and followed at UCSF and 3 at UPMC. \n\n\n### VY-AADC01 Preparation, Dosing, and Administration \n  \nVY-AADC01, a recombinant AAV2 vector carrying complementary DNA encoding the human AADC enzyme under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, was prepared as previously described  in accordance with FDA good manufacturing practice. VY-AADC01 was delivered at escalating maximum total doses across 3 trial cohorts: cohort 1 received VY-AADC01 at a concentration of 8.3 \u00d7 10  vector genomes (vg)/mL and up to 450 \u00b5L per putamen for a maximum total dose of up to 7.5 \u00d7 10  vg; cohort 2 received the same concentration as cohort 1 and up to 900 \u00b5L per putamen for a total dose of up to 1.5 \u00d7 10  vg; in cohort 3, the concentration was increased to 2.6 \u00d7 10  vg/mL and the volume (up to 900 \u00b5L per putamen) was kept identical to cohort 2 for a maximum total dose of up to 4.7 \u00d7 10  vg. Full details of the surgical administration of VY-AADC01 have been published.  In brief, participants were placed under general anesthesia and positioned supine within the bore of an MRI scanner. The ClearPoint system (ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.), which consists of an MRI-compatible skull-mounted aiming device (SmartFrame) and MRI-integrated software, was used to plan and guide cannula placement. VY-AADC01 was administered via 2\u20133 trajectories to the putamen using SmartFlow stepped tip cannulae (ClearPoint Neuro, Inc.) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED), with a primary goal of achieving maximal possible coverage of the postcommissural putamen, as it is the motor region of the putamen and shows greater loss of dopaminergic terminals than the anterior putamen in PD.  Cannula trajectories were chosen to center the cannula within the putamen, with the tip at least 3 mm from any putaminal borders, and to avoid direct contact with perivascular spaces. Prior to administration, VY-AADC01 was admixed with the contrast agent gadoteridol to allow for real-time MRI monitoring of infusate distribution and assessment of putamen coverage. Gadoteridol distribution has been shown to be a reliable predictor of vector distribution following CED of AAV2-AADC in primates.  The infusion technique was refined over the course of the trial to maximize putamen coverage and mitigate \u201coff-target\u201d distribution.  Participants were monitored postoperatively in the hospital for at least 1 night. \n\n\n### Putamen Coverage Analysis \n  \nVY-AADC01 volumetric coverage of the putamen was determined using iPlan Flow software (Brainlab AG) as previously described.  Gadoteridol-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained at the end of infusion were compared with preinfusion MR images to determine the percentage of total putamen volume to which drug was administered. The overlap between pre- and postinfusion MR images was used to calculate percent coverage of each putamen, with total putamen coverage expressed as a single value representing the average across right and left putamen. \n\n\n### F-DOPA PET to Assess AADC Activity \n  \nThe distribution and change in AADC activity at 6 months postadministration was a secondary outcome. (18)F-fluoro- -dihydroxyphenylalanine ( F-DOPA) PET scans were acquired at baseline prior to administration of VY-AADC01 and 5\u20136 months postadministration as previously described.  On each occasion, participants were given oral carbidopa (2.5 mg/kg; 200 mg maximum dose) 60\u201390 minutes prior to  F-DOPA administration, and acquisition frames were captured 65\u201375 minutes later for subsequent analysis. The striatum (putamen) to occipital cortex standardized uptake ratio (SOR-1) was calculated for the right and left putamen, with the 2 values averaged to provide a single value. The 5- to 6-month postadministration value was expressed as percent change from baseline. \n\n\n### Safety and Clinical Outcomes \n  \nThe primary outcome measure was the safety and tolerability of   AADC   gene transfer (Class IV evidence) as assessed by frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) and their relationship to VY-AADC01 or the trial procedure. Secondary outcome measures included changes from baseline in PD medications measured as daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED)  and motor function as assessed by PD diary  good \u201con\u201d time (defined as the sum of \u201con\u201d time with no dyskinesia and \u201con\u201d time with nontroublesome dyskinesia) and \u201coff\u201d time, Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) total scores, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III) \u201coff\u201d-medication and \u201con\u201d-medication scores, and mH&Y scale \u201coff\u201d-medication scores. Changes to PD medications were made at the discretion of the investigator. Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) were assessed throughout follow-up. Changes in quality of life were assessed using the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). The \u201coff\u201d medication state was defined as \u226512 hours after stopping PD medications; the \u201con\u201d medication state was defined as 30\u2013120 minutes after taking the first daily dose of PD medications when participants and investigators both agreed that benefits of PD medications had occurred. If the participant was not fully \u201con\u201d as judged by the participant and investigator, an additional \u00bd to 1 carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg tablet was administered. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nA sample size of up to 20 participants was chosen to provide preliminary evidence of safety and potential efficacy; this estimate was not based on statistical power calculations. Primary and secondary outcome measures were analyzed using descriptive methods. Postsurgical mean absolute changes from baseline or percent changes from baseline were summarized by cohort. Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which included all participants who initiated any trial procedure, starting from the beginning of preinfusion anesthesia. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all enrolled participants who had efficacy assessment data at baseline and at \u22651 postsurgical visit. The ITT population was used for analyses of vector coverage of the putamen, AADC expression, and clinical efficacy. PD diary data were normalized to a 16-hour waking day. Vector coverage of the putamen and changes from baseline in AADC expression and clinical outcomes are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM. One participant in cohort 1 underwent bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) placement 34 months after VY-AADC01. The indication for DBS was gradual worsening of PD motor symptoms including rest tremor, dyskinesias, and wearing off. All these features preceded participation in this trial and were considered consistent with typical PD progression. In this participant, 36-month assessments were performed with DBS stimulation \u201con.\u201d A sensitivity analysis of 36-month outcomes in cohort 1 excluding this participant's data was conducted. \n\n\n### Data Availability \n  \nNBIb-1817 (VY-AADC01) is an investigational product that has not yet been approved for any indication; we do not plan to share the study data or related documents at this time. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Baseline Characteristics \n  \nThe ITT and safety populations included 15 participants (5 participants in each cohort;  ). Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar across cohorts and consistent with moderately advanced PD ( ). At baseline, the UPDRS III \u201con\u201d-medication score was lower in cohort 1; in cohort 3, the UDysRS total score and PDQ-39 summary index score were higher than the other cohorts. Cohort 3 included 2 participants with mH&Y stage 4 \u201coff\u201d medication and 3 participants with mH&Y stage 3 \u201coff\u201d medication, whereas all participants in cohorts 1 and 2 were stage 3. \n   Participant Flow Diagram for the PD-1101 Trial  \nPD-1101 was a phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation trial of VY-AADC01 in participants with moderately advanced Parkinson disease. Of the 2 participants excluded from enrollment, 1 participant had an elevated anti-AAV2 antibody titer and the other participant had a modified Hoehn & Yahr score below the inclusion criteria. Participants were screened for eligibility within 60 days of VY-AADC01 administration and followed for 36 months after administration. All participants were included in analyses. \n    \nDemographics and Baseline Characteristics \n  \n\n### Safety Outcomes \n  \nVY-AADC01 and the surgical procedure were well-tolerated over the 3-year trial. A total of 4 SAEs were reported in 2 participants, all of which resolved and were assessed by the investigator as not related to VY-AADC01. As previously reported,  1 participant experienced a pulmonary embolism and subsequent atrial fibrillation due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The investigator assessed the DVT as unrelated to VY-AADC01. The DVT was considered likely attributable to immobilization during surgery. Intraoperative sequential leg compression for DVT prophylaxis was used during subsequent surgical procedures, and no other AEs of thromboembolic events occurred during the trial. Another participant experienced 2 SAEs of small bowel obstruction, which occurred 6 days apart, 29 months after VY-AADC01 administration. A summary of SAEs and treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurring in >2 participants is reported in  . Most events were either grade 1 or grade 2 (97%) in severity and considered unrelated to VY-AADC01 (91%). The most common TEAE was headache in the immediate postoperative period, which affected 11 participants (73%) overall. Dyskinesia was reported in 4 participants (27%) and was considered probably related to treatment in all 4 participants. Each participant was carefully monitored for the development of worsening dyskinesias (including runaway dyskinesias) but in all cases, dyskinesias were transient and resolved with dose reduction of PD medications or the addition of amantadine. No participants discontinued evaluations following administration of VY-AADC01 due to AEs. \n  \nNumber of Participants With Any Serious Adverse Event and Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events That Occurred in >2 Participants by MedDRA Preferred Term \n  \n\n### VY-AADC01 Coverage of the Putamen and AADC Activity Changes \n  \nAs previously reported,  VY-AADC01 coverage of the total putamen was 21% \u00b1 1%, 34% \u00b1 2%, and 42% \u00b1 3% in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Coverage of the preferentially-targeted postcommissural putamen was 20% \u00b1 6%, 39% \u00b1 5%, and 53% \u00b1 5%, respectively ( ). Changes in AADC enzyme activity as measured by  F-DOPA PET 5\u20136 months after VY-AADC01 administration followed a dose-dependent pattern, with increases of 13% \u00b1 7%, 56% \u00b1 13%, and 79% \u00b1 15% in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively ( ). Increases from baseline in AADC enzyme activity as measured by  F-DOPA PET and total putamen coverage were positively correlated. \n   AADC Enzyme Activity, VY-AADC01 Putaminal Coverage, and LED Change From Baseline by Cohort in PD-1101  \n(A) Coverage and  -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme activity data shown are mean percent coverage (total putamen coverage and posterior putamen coverage) and percent AADC increase from baseline. Error bars represent SEM. Change from baseline in AADC enzyme activity was measured using  F-DOPA PET 5\u20136 months after VY-AADC01 administration. The change in AADC enzyme activity as measured by  F-DOPA PET correlated with total putamen coverage. (B) Levodopa equivalent dose (LED) changes from baseline at months 12, 24, and 36 are shown as mean change in mg/day \u00b1 SEM. Daily PD medication requirements were decreased from baseline in cohorts 2 and 3 throughout the trial. A sensitivity analysis that excluded the participant in cohort 1 who underwent deep brain stimulation resulted in a mean \u00b1 SEM change from baseline of 531 \u00b1 465 mg/day at month 36. \n  \n\n### Changes in PD Medication Requirements \n  \nDaily PD medication requirements as measured by LED were decreased from baseline in cohorts 2 and 3 throughout the trial ( ). At end of trial (36 months after VY-AADC01 administration), mean changes from baseline in LED of \u2212322 \u00b1 124 mg/day (21% decrease) and \u2212441 \u00b1 73 mg/day (30% decrease) were documented in cohorts 2 and 3, respectively. In cohort 1, LED remained stable at 12 and 24 months, but then increased by 343 \u00b1 406 mg/day (23% increase) above baseline at 36 months; excluding data from the participant who underwent DBS resulted in an increase of 531 \u00b1 465 mg/day from baseline. \n\n\n### Changes in Motor Function, Global Impressions, and Quality of Life \n  \nAll other clinical outcomes were stable or improved compared with baseline in the \u201con\u201d-medication and \u201coff\u201d-medication states across all 3 cohorts throughout this 36-month trial. Excluding data from the participant who underwent DBS had a minimal effect on the reported results. \n\nPD diary data are shown in  . Improvements in PD diary good \u201con\u201d time were reported in cohorts 1 and 2 at all annual follow-up assessments, with increases from baseline at the final 36-month follow-up of 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.2 \u00b1 1.7 hours, respectively. In cohort 3 there was an improvement in good \u201con\u201d time at 12 months (1.5 \u00b1 0.5 hours) that returned to baseline at both 24 months (0.3 \u00b1 1.2 hours) and 36 months (0.3 \u00b1 0.7 hours). PD diary \u201con\u201d time with troublesome dyskinesia and UDysRS total score remained relatively stable and comparable to baseline over the 36-month trial in each of the 3 cohorts. At 36 months, changes from baseline in PD diary \u201con\u201d time with troublesome dyskinesia and UDysRS total score in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.3 hours and \u22122.4 \u00b1 3.7 points, \u22120.3 \u00b1 1.3 hours and 4.4 \u00b1 2.5 points, and \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.6 hours and 4.0 \u00b1 5.0 points. Improvements in PD diary \u201coff\u201d time were similar to those observed for good \u201con\u201d time throughout the trial. Specifically, improvements in \u201coff\u201d time were reported in cohorts 1 and 2 at 12 months (\u22121.4 \u00b1 0.9 hours and \u22122.3 \u00b1 0.6 hours, respectively) that were maintained through the final 36-month follow-up (\u22121.7 \u00b1 0.8 hours and \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.5 hours, respectively). An improvement in \u201coff\u201d time was reported in cohort 3 at 12 months (\u22120.5 \u00b1 0.8 hours) that was maintained at 24 months (\u22120.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours) but returned to baseline at 36 months (\u22120.2 \u00b1 0.9 hours). \n   PD Diary \u201cOff\u201d Time and \u201cOn\u201d Times at Baseline and Months 12, 24, and 36  \nData shown are mean hours normalized to a 16-hour waking day. Change from baseline (CFB) at 36 months is reported to the right of each panel. PD diary \u201coff\u201d time and good \u201con\u201d time (sum of \u201con\u201d time with no dyskinesia and \u201con\u201d time with nontroublesome dyskinesia [NTD]) were stable or improved from baseline throughout the trial. In a sensitivity analysis that excluded the participant in cohort 1 who underwent deep brain stimulation, \u201coff\u201d time and good \u201con\u201d time (mean \u00b1 SEM) at month 36 were 3.4 \u00b1 1.5 hours and 12.3 \u00b1 1.6 hours, respectively. TD = troublesome dyskinesia. \n  \nUPDRS III \u201coff\u201d-medication scores improved from baseline in all cohorts at all annual follow-up assessments ( ). Improvements in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 at 12 months were maintained through 36 months, with changes from baseline of \u221219.0 \u00b1 3.9 points, \u221212.2 \u00b1 3.3 points, and \u221210.2 \u00b1 4.6 points, respectively, at the final 36-month follow-up. Improvements in UPDRS III \u201con\u201d-medication scores were observed in cohorts 2 and 3 at 12 months, which persisted at the final 36-month follow-up (\u22127.8 \u00b1 1.6 points and \u22123.8 \u00b1 1.5 points, respectively;  ). The UPDRS III \u201con\u201d-medication score in cohort 1 remained low and comparable to baseline at all annual follow-up assessments. \n   Changes From Baseline in UPDRS III Scores  \n(A) \u201cOff\u201d medication. (B) \u201cOn\u201d medication. Data shown are mean change in points \u00b1 SEM. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III \u201coff\u201d-medication scores improved in all cohorts throughout the trial, and \u201con\u201d-medication scores improved in cohorts 2 and 3 throughout the trial. A sensitivity analysis that excluded the participant in cohort 1 who underwent deep brain stimulation resulted in a mean \u00b1 SEM change from baseline of \u221217.3 \u00b1 4.5 points (\u201coff\u201d medication) and 0.8 \u00b1 2.4 points (\u201con\u201d medication) at month 36. \n  \nImprovement in mH&Y stage (\u201coff\u201d medication) at the final 36-month follow-up assessment was observed in 14/15 participants, and 1 participant in cohort 3 had no change. In cohort 1, of 5 participants with mH&Y stage 3 at baseline, 4 participants improved to stage 2 and 1 participant improved to stage 2.5 at 36 months. All 5 participants in cohort 2 improved from mH&Y stage 3 at baseline to stage 2 at 36 months. In cohort 3, of 3 participants with mH&Y stage 3 and 2 participants with stage 4 at baseline, 3 participants improved to stage 2 and 1 participant improved to stage 2.5. \n\nCGI-I scale scores indicated improvement from baseline in all 15 participants. At 36 months, clinicians rated 1 participant as \u201cvery much improved,\u201d 11 participants as \u201cmuch improved,\u201d and 3 participants as \u201cminimally improved.\u201d PGI-I scale score results were similar and indicated improvement from baseline in 12 of 15 participants at 36 months, with 1 participant \u201cvery much improved,\u201d 10 participants \u201cmuch improved,\u201d and 1 participant \u201cminimally improved.\u201d Three of 15 participants reported being \u201cminimally worse.\u201d \n\nIn cohort 1, quality of life as assessed by the PDQ-39 summary index score remained stable and comparable to baseline at all annual follow-up assessments ( ). PDQ-39 summary index scores were improved in cohort 2 throughout the trial, and in cohort 3, were improved at 12 and 24 months but were returning toward baseline at 36 months. \n   Changes From Baseline in PDQ-39 Summary Index Score at Months 12, 24, and 36  \nData shown are mean change in points \u00b1 SEM. Quality of life (39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire [PDQ-39]) scores were improved throughout the trial in cohort 2, and at months 12 and 24 in cohort 3. A sensitivity analysis that excluded the participant in cohort 1 who underwent deep brain stimulation resulted in a mean \u00b1 SEM change from baseline of \u22120.6 \u00b1 4.6 points at month 36. \n  \n\n### Classification of Evidence \n  \nThis trial provides Class IV evidence that VY-AADC01 and the associated surgical delivery procedure were well-tolerated in a population 40\u201370 years of age with moderately advanced PD, and that in the 2 higher-dose cohorts (at total doses of up to 1.5 \u00d7 10  vg and 4.7 \u00d7 10  vg), stable or improved clinical outcomes were observed along with reduced PD medication requirements for at least 3 years. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe final 3-year results from the PD-1101 trial demonstrate that VY-AADC01 and the surgical delivery procedure were well-tolerated with no vector-related SAEs reported. The safety and tolerability of VY-AADC01 was observed with infusion volumes that were several-fold higher than those in previous AADC gene therapy trials in PD.  The most common TEAEs were mostly transient, including dyskinesias, which resolved with PD medication dose reductions or addition of amantadine. \n\nAll cohorts showed stability or improvement in motor function, global impressions of change, and quality of life throughout the 3 years. In cohorts 2 and 3, the stability or improvement in outcomes was observed with reduced LED, which may indicate an increased responsiveness to therapeutic levodopa after treatment with VY-AADC01 as previously reported from the levodopa infusion substudy of this trial.  Indications of improved motor function following VY-AADC01 were observed across multiple endpoints. Specifically, PD diary good \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d times improved throughout the trial in cohorts 1 and 2, whereas cohort 3 improved at month 12 before returning to baseline at month 36. UPDRS III \u201coff\u201d-medication and \u201con\u201d-medication scores also improved from baseline in all cohorts at all annual follow-up assessments, except for the \u201con\u201d-medication score in cohort 1, which remained low and comparable to baseline throughout the trial (note that the UPDRS III mean \u201con\u201d-medication score in cohort 1 was 7.6 \u00b1 2.3 at baseline). Similarly, improvement in mH&Y stage (\u201coff\u201d medication) at the final 3-year follow-up assessment was observed in 14/15 participants, and 1 participant in cohort 3 remained stable. Importantly, PD diary \u201con\u201d time with troublesome dyskinesia and UDysRS total score remained relatively stable and comparable to baseline in each of the 3 cohorts, indicating a lack of increased dyskinesia over the 3-year trial. The clinician- and participant-rated global impressions of change (CGI-I and PGI-I) scores indicated improvement in 100% and 80% of participants, respectively, and quality of life as assessed by the PDQ-39 summary index score indicated improvement in cohort 2 and stability in cohort 1 throughout the trial, with a transient benefit in cohort 3 that returned toward baseline at the final assessment. Collectively, these results suggest that VY-AADC01 may provide clinical and functional benefits in moderately advanced PD. Potential clinical and functional benefits should be considered in the context of the study design, which was phase 1b, open label, and intended to provide Class IV evidence that putaminal infusion of VY-AADC01 is well tolerated in patients with moderately advanced PD and motor fluctuations and may improve motor function and did not include a control group. A sham surgery\u2013controlled trial will be needed to demonstrate robust efficacy of VY-AADC01. \n\nThe durability of motor function stability or improvement throughout the 3-year trial, with concurrent LED reduction in cohorts 2 and 3, suggests that a single infusion of VY-AADC01 may have been associated with a persistent increase in putaminal AADC enzyme activity.  Consistent with PD-1101, persistent increases in AADC enzyme activity have been described in a previous phase 1 clinical trial of AAV2-hAADC that reported a dose-dependent increase in AADC activity in the putamen that was maintained through 4 years of follow-up,  and in a preclinical nonhuman primate (NHP) study, which demonstrated that treatment with AAV2-hAADC restored enzyme activity to normal levels and enhanced behavioral responses to levodopa through 8 years of follow-up.  The primary cellular source of the persistently increased AADC activity in the NHP putamen was found to be medium spiny neurons,  which do not degenerate in PD.  AADC expression in these cells may provide an alternate path for dopamine production to supplement the loss from the nigrostriatal neurons that degenerate in PD. \n\nThe levels of putamen coverage achieved in cohorts 2 and 3 of PD-1101 (34% and 42%, respectively) exceeded putamen coverage in cohort 1 (21%). A similar pattern was observed for AADC activity as measured by  F-DOPA PET (56% and 79% increases in cohorts 2 and 3, respectively, vs an increase of 13% in cohort 1). Unlike PD-1101, prior AAV2-hAADC clinical trials likely did not achieve putamen coverage above \u223c10%.  In the prior phase 1 clinical trial of AAV2-hAADC, despite modest early clinical benefit and persistent enhancement of AADC activity, durable clinical efficacy (>12 months) was not observed.  The potential benefit of achieving sufficient coverage and AADC activity enhancement in PD-1101 was evident across multiple clinical assessments and outcomes indicating an improvement from baseline that was generally greater in cohorts 2 and 3 compared with cohort 1, including LED reduction, UPDRS III \u201con\u201d-medication score, and PDQ-39 summary index. However, we did not observe a clear dose response between cohorts 2 and 3. The lack of an evident dose response between the 2 higher-dose cohorts may be attributable to the small number of participants, variability of baseline characteristics (i.e., cohort 3 had higher baseline mH&Y, UDysRS, and PDQ-39 scale scores, indicating greater overall PD severity than cohort 2), or the possibility of a \u201cceiling effect,\u201d whereby exceeding the dose required for response does not provide a greater magnitude of benefit. \n\nPrior to PD-1101, the abovementioned open-label, phase 1 clinical trial investigated the effects of AAV2-hAADC gene therapy administered to the putamen in PD and followed participants for 4 years.  That trial confirmed the safety and tolerability of the AAV2-hAADC vector delivered to the putamen using CED, and reported that treatment persistently increased AADC enzyme activity throughout the follow-up period.  However, no reductions in LED were observed, and benefits to motor function (total UPDRS \u201con\u201d-medication and \u201coff\u201d-medication scores) were present for the first 12 months before deteriorating thereafter.  Another trial of 6 months duration that included participants with PD in Japan investigated the effects of AAV2-hAADC administered to the putamen and reported a favorable safety/tolerability profile, increase of AADC enzyme activity, modest improvements in motor function, and no reduction in LED.  Although these trials used a different surgical approach than PD-1101, the low infusion volumes (100 \u00b5L per putamen), total vector doses (up to 3 \u00d7 10  vg), and target coverage (<10%) likely played a role in the limited efficacy reported.  Neither trial was equipped to monitor infusate distribution during the infusions to assess target coverage and off-target spread. In contrast, PD-1101 employed innovative techniques, specifically, real-time MRI-monitored infusions, stepped tip cannula design, and progressive cannula advancement during infusion, to achieve greater infusion volumes and target tissue coverage than previous AAV2-hAADC trials.  Other gene therapy trials in PD assessed the effects of neurotrophic factors or other enzymes (for a comprehensive review, see Richardson et al. ). Although methodologic differences between these prior trials and PD-1101 preclude direct comparison, few of the prior trials reported long-term (>12 months) clinical benefit with reduced LED. \n\nDBS is a standard therapy used to improve motor symptoms in advanced PD when these are no longer adequately managed with medication.  Long-term follow-up of participants with PD who received GPi or subthalamic nucleus DBS reported stable improvements in the primary outcome of UPDRS III scores in the \u201con\u201d stimulation/\u201coff\u201d medication state with associated reductions in LED over 36 months.  These results appear similar to PD-1101 in that benefits to motor function were observed concurrent with reduced LED through 3 years of follow-up. \n\nPD-1101 did not include a control group and its primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of   AADC   gene therapy. Although there are limited data on the natural progression of motor impairment in moderately advanced PD to help contextualize the observed effects of VY-AADC01 on motor function in the current trial, long-term extension studies of therapies designed for use in moderately advanced PD can provide insight into the expected progression in such participants under medical management. For example, a long-term extension study of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel reported initial improvements over the first year of treatment in PD diary \u201coff\u201d time and good \u201con\u201d time (\u223c4 hours each) that were maintained over \u223c3 years of follow-up.  However, UPDRS (total and part III on medication) and PDQ-39 scores worsened even as LED remained constant or increased throughout follow-up. Similarly, long-term studies (CLEOPATRA-PD and PREFER) of rotigotine, a dopamine receptor agonist administered via a transdermal delivery system, reported initial improvement in UPDRS II and III scores during a 5- to 7-week dose titration period in participants with advanced PD that then steadily declined over the subsequent 3-year maintenance period and LED increased \u223c40%\u2013100%.  These findings, combined with worsening mH&Y stage scores, suggest continuing disease progression over the course of both studies despite continued medical therapy. In PD-1101, stability or improvements in clinician- and participant-reported outcomes were observed, along with reduced LED in the 2 higher-dose cohorts, over a similar 3-year period. Although these PD-1101 results suggest potential long-term clinical benefit following a single administration of VY-AADC01, a sham surgery controlled trial will be needed to provide a robust assessment of treatment efficacy given the placebo effects observed in previous drug and surgical trials in PD. \n\nThe PD-1101 trial supports the long-term safety and potential durability of VY-AADC01 clinical effects following a single administration.

Study outcomes were four determinations of cognitive impairment or decline, and biomarker predictors were baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; volume and thickness), diffusion tensor imaging (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; amyloid beta [A\u03b2], tau and alpha synuclein), and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PD cognition. Additionally, longitudinal structural MRI and DAT scan data were included. Univariate analyses were run initially, with false discovery rate = 0.2, to select biomarker variables for inclusion in multivariable longitudinal mixed-effect models. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nBy year 3, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 15\u201338% participants depending on the criteria applied. Biomarkers, some longitudinal, predicting cognitive impairment in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency (decreased caudate and putamen DAT availability); (2) diffuse, cortical decreased brain volume or thickness (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions); (3) co-morbid Alzheimer\u2019s disease A\u03b2 amyloid pathology (lower CSF A\u03b2 1\u201342); and (4) genes (  COMT   val/val and   BDNF   val/val genotypes). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nCognitive impairment in PD increases in frequency 50\u2013200% in the first several years of disease, and is independently predicted by biomarker changes related to nigrostriatal or cortical dopaminergic deficits, global atrophy due to possible widespread effects of neurodegenerative disease, co-morbid Alzheimer\u2019s disease plaque pathology, and genetic factors. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn Parkinson disease (PD) cognitive impairment can occur in a range of cognitive domains[ ], dementia (PDD) affects up to 80% of patients long-term[ ], mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) occurs in 25\u201330% of non-demented patients[ ] and is a risk factor for dementia[ ], and cognitive deficits are present in some patients at the time of diagnosis[ ]. \n\nA range of demographic and clinical correlates or potential risk factors for cognitive decline have been identified, including increasing age and duration of PD, male sex, specific motor features (postural instability gait disorder [PIGD] subtype), and a range of non-motor symptoms (e.g., visual hallucinations, apathy, depression, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder)[ ]. \n\nCortical Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology appears to be the major contributing pathology to cognitive decline in PD[ ], but Alzheimer disease (AD)-related changes are also present in a significant percentage of patients[ ]. A range of neurotransmitter deficits have been implicated, including in acetylcholine[ ], dopamine[ ], and norepinephrine systems[ ]. Genetic influences have been identified in some studies, including apolipoprotein E4 [  ApoE4  ] status[ ] and SNPs in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (  BDNF  ) val met[ ], catechol-O-methyl-transferase (  COMT  ) val met[ ], and microtubule-associated protein tau (  MAPT  )[ ]. Finally, diffuse (primarily medial temporal lobe, parietal lobe and prefrontal cortex) gray matter atrophy and white matter changes have been associated with cognitive decline in PD[ ,  ]. \n\nThe research on the neural substrates of the initial stages of cognitive decline in PD, starting with disease onset, are limited, with previous studies often characterized by single site participation, relatively small sample sizes, cross-sectional design, or a limited biomarker assessment. The Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, biomarker-rich observational study of disease progression in early PD[ ]. The biomarkers obtained in the PPMI study include dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging, brain structural MRI, CSF and blood biomarkers as well as DNA for genotyping. The goals of these analyses were to evaluate which baseline and longitudinal biomarkers may predict cognitive impairment in early PD. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nNewly diagnosed, untreated PD patients (N = 423) were enrolled in PPMI from June 2010\u2014May 2013 out a cohort of 489 screened patients. At baseline PD participants were required to: (1) have a recent idiopathic PD diagnosis; (3) be untreated for PD; (4) have a dopamine transporter (DAT) deficit on imaging; and (5) not have dementia as determined by the site investigator. The aims and methodology of the study have been published elsewhere[ ] and are available at  . The overall study was approved by the Research Subjects Review Board at the University of Rochester, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at each site, and participants provided written informed consent. Clinical data out to three years post-baseline was utilized. Data was downloaded on September 21, 2015; at the time of data download 38 PD patients had discontinued study participation (9.0% discontinuation). \n\n\n### Experimental design \n  \n#### Cognitive abilities \n  \nCognition was assessed at baseline and annually. Global cognition was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In addition, a detailed cognitive battery, as previously described and referenced[ ], assessing the following domains was administered: memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HLVT-R]); visuospatial function (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation [JOLO]) 15-item (split-half) version; processing speed-attention (Symbol-Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]); and executive function and working memory (Letter-Number Sequencing [LNS] and semantic fluency [animals, vegetables and fruits]). Level II PD-MCI criteria[ ] were not applicable given the lack of a separate language assessment or 10 cognitive tests across 5 domains. Published norms for each test were applied. \n\n\n#### Definitions of cognitive impairment \n  \nFor the purposes of these analyses cognitive impairment was defined three different ways: \n  \nThe recommended MoCA cut-off for PD of <26 was applied[ ]. Additionally, MoCA score was also examined as a continuous variable. \n  \nUsing the detailed cognitive battery, cognitive impairment was defined as at least two test scores >1.5 standard deviations below the standardized mean score, a level of impairment within the recommend range (>1.0\u20132.0) of standard deviations below the mean to support a PD-MCI diagnosis[ ]. Single scores were generated for each test, except for the HVLT-T, for which two scores were used (immediate free recall and recognition discrimination). \n  \nThe site investigator\u2019s clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment (PD-MCI or PDD) versus no cognitive impairment was made annually. Each site investigator was provided an instruction sheet that outlined how to assess cognitive decline, functional impairment, and general interpretation of cognitive tests to make a diagnosis of PD-MCI[ ] or PDD[ ]. As previously described [ ], the site investigator\u2019s annual determination of cognitive impairment was introduced after some participants already had completed their baseline and year 1 visits (106/423 [25.1%] of available patients had this assessment performed at baseline, and 271/395 [68.6%] at year 1). \n  \nSecondary analyses examined only incident cognitive impairment, including only those participants who did not meet one of the three criteria for cognitive impairment at the baseline visit (N = 394). \n\n\n#### Biomarkers \n  \nDetails about the biospecimen collection and analysis has been published[ ]. \n  \nDAT SPECT imaging (DaTscan ) was obtained at baseline and annually. Ipsilateral (i.e., brain hemisphere on   same   side as predominant motor symptoms) and contralateral (i.e., brain hemisphere on   opposite   side as predominant motor symptoms) caudate and putamen values were used. \n  \nCSF was obtained at baseline, month 6, year 1, and then annually using collection steps as described [ ]. At the time of data download, values were available only for the baseline visit. Reported are levels of alpha synuclein (\u03b1-synuclein), total tau, p-tau181, beta-amyloid 1\u201342 (A\u03b242), t-tau:A\u03b242 ratio, p-tau181:A\u03b242 ratio, and p-tau181:total tau ratio. These CSF biomarkers were measured in centralized laboratories using the xMAP INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay (Fujirebio, Ghent Belgium) for total tau, p-tau181 and beta-amyloid 1\u201342 (A\u03b242) at the UPenn Biomarker Research Laboratory) or with commercially available ELISA kits (Covance laboratory, Dedham, MA) as described in detail elsewhere[ ]. \n  \nStructural MRI with minimum requirements for these analyses were obtained at baseline and annually, and were available for a subset of participants at baseline (N = 160). These participants were enrolled at 10 PPMI sites that used a standardized protocol for 3 Tesla machines (all Siemens Healthcare, USA). A 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence was used for imaging brain anatomy (176 axial slices, repetition time = 2300 ms, echo time = 2.98 ms, flip angle = 9\u00b0, voxel size 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm ). The images were centrally processed at UCSF for cortical and subcortical morphometric measurements using FreeSurfer version 5.1[ ]. FreeSurfer is a suite of algorithmic tools that automatically creates models of most anatomical brain structures on MRI based on a subject-independent probabilistic brain atlas in combination with nonlinear image registration of individual images to obtain subject-specific measurements. FreeSurfer version 5.1 uses a longitudinal workflow that estimates brain morphometry unbiased toward the chronological scan order by building first a template image from all time points as an unbiased prior distribution for each subject before computing morphometric deformations for every time point. This strategy reduces the random variation in the processing procedure and improves the robustness and sensitivity of the overall longitudinal analysis. A previous test-retest study validated that the longitudinal processing provides consistent brain parcellation[ ]. All raw images as well as the results of brain parcellation underwent a visual quality control by trained technicians. A partial failure rating for gross parcellation errors in 1 or more specific brain regions occurred in about 15% of the image, but none had a complete parcellation failure. The errors also did not appear to be systematic and MRIs with a partial failure rating were still included in the analyses but only the correctly parcellated brain regions were assessed. The outcome measures of the FreeSurfer workflow were 93 automatically-labeled brain regions, including gyri and subcortical structures, for each subject. MRI data for baseline, year 1 and year 2 visits were utilized for volume and thickness for 34 regions, with left and right hemisphere values averaged. \n  \nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI results were available for a subset of participants who also had structural MRI (N = 151). DTI data from 9 of 160 with MRI had to be excluded because of poor data quality. DTI measures were mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) for 61 brain regions, with left and right hemisphere values averaged. A cardiac-gated two-dimensional single-shot echo-planar sequence for mapping brain water DTI (TR ranged from 8,400 to 8,800 depending on subjects\u2019 heart rate, TE = 88ms, 2 mm isotropic resolution; 72 contiguous slices, twofold acceleration, axial-oblique aligned along the anterior-posterior commissure, with diffusion-weighted gradients along 64 sensitization directions and a b factor of 1000s/mm2) was acquired for each participant. Processing images were first visually inspected for significant image artifacts and then processed using an automated processing script designed for longitudinal data analysis. The initial steps include corrections for head motion, eddy-current effects and susceptibility distortions of DTI[ ], followed by the computation of standard scalar parameter maps of the diffusion tensor, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (rD), and axial diffusivity (aD). An intra-subject affine registration was performed between the parametric DTI maps and the structural T1- and T2- weighted images at baseline. An inter-subject registration was performed for group analysis using the standard protocol of DARTEL, which involves tissue segmentation of the structural images for DARTEL initialization, a diffeomorphic algorithm for inter-subject image registration, and finally a spatial normalization of the registered images to MNI space[ ], allowing the anatomical parcellation of the brain according to the JHU-DTI-MNI (Type I WMPM)[ ]. To reduce any group bias in the anatomical parcellation, a group-averaged template was created from all subject images in MNI space, followed by a non-linear registration between the JHU-DTI-MNI atlas and the group-averaged template. The JHU-DTI-MNI atlas is reversely transformed to each subject space, facilitating regions-of-interest (ROIs) extraction from each parametric DTI map at baseline. For group analysis, DTI measures were extracted from 118 ROIs in the entire white matter and subcortical regions, including the basal ganglia and brain stem sub-regions. The outcome measures of the FreeSurfer workflow were 93 automatically-labeled brain regions, including gyri and subcortical structures, for each subject, based on the Desikan-Killiany brain structure atlas[ ]. \n  \nGenotyping was performed with NeuroX, a genotyping platform comprised of standard Illumina exome content (~240,000 variants) and over 24,000 custom content variants focusing on neurologic diseases (~24,000 variants)[ ]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with cognitive impairment or decline in PD were examined (i.e., apolipoprotein E4 [  ApoE4  ], glucocerebrosidase [  GBA  ; N3705], leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 [  LRKK2  ; G20195], synuclein [rs3910105 and rs356181], microtubule associated protein tau [  MAPT  ; rs17649553, which is in linkage dysequilibrium with the H1 haplotype], brain-derived neurotrophic factor val met [  BDNF   val met], and Catechol-O-methyltransferase val met [  COMT   val met]). rs17649553 is in strong linkage dysequilibrium with an \u201cH1 tagging\u201d SNP (rs242928; D\u2019 = 0.991, R2 = 0.203). \n  \n\n#### Statistical analysis \n  \nLongitudinal logistic or linear mixed-effect models were used to find baseline and longitudinal predictors (treated as time-dependent predictors) of cognitive impairment over the 3-year time period. The following covariates were considered for each cognitive outcome: age, sex, race, education level, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD)[ ], baseline MDS Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score, baseline depression (GDS-15 score \u22655), baseline psychosis (MDS-UPDRS 1.2 item score >0), and baseline REM sleep behavior disorder (RBDSQ score \u22655). To select the most appropriate set of covariates for each outcome, a combination of Akaike information criteria (AIC) fit statistics and univariate p-values were used to perform a backwards selection of covariates to find the best model fit. AIC fit statistics were also used to determine whether site should be included as a random effect for each outcome. In addition to these selected covariates, models examining MRI volume also adjusted for total intracranial volume (ICV), and models examining MRI DTI measures also adjusted for white matter density in each individual region examined. \n\nAfter covariates and random effects were selected for each outcome, univariate analyses were run for each biomarker variable to predict cognitive impairment over time. Due to the large number of predictors, a false discovery rate (FDR) approach (FDR = 0.2) was used to select biomarker variables from the univariate analyses for inclusion in multivariable models run with other biomarkers. Then, variables were removed from the multivariable model individually in a backwards selection process until all remaining variables were significant at 0.1 level. To avoid collinearity with biomarkers, the following rules were used when fitting the multivariable models: if contralateral putamen or caudate measures were significant in a univariate manner, they were considered in the multivariable model. If not, but ipsilateral putamen or caudate measures were significant in a univariate manner, they were considered in the multivariable model. Similarly, if any of the individual CSF biomarkers were significant in a univariate manner, they were considered in the multivariable model; CSF ratios were only considered in the multivariable model if neither of the individual biomarkers was significant. \n\nAs structural and diffusion tensor MRIs were only available in a subset of patients, two populations were analyzed for each cognitive outcome: (1) the subset of participants with MRI data (these models included MRI plus other biomarker data), and (2) the full population (these models included only other biomarker data). Separate models were run for baseline predictors (all biomarkers) and longitudinal predictors (DAT imaging and structural MRI). \n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Participant characteristics \n  \nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics for all PD participants (N = 423) are in  . The cohort is approximately two-thirds male, overwhelmingly white, and highly educated. The characteristics for the subset of participants with MRI data (N = 160) was similar to that of the full population.   lists the number of PD participants with biomarker availability at each time point. Genetic, CSF, and DTI testing was done at baseline, and DAT imaging and MRI thickness and volumes at baseline, year 1 and year 2. \n   Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.         Biomarker availability at baseline and longitudinally.      \n\n### Cognitive outcomes over time \n  \nCognitive assessments were available for up to 423 participants at baseline, 395 at year 1, 376 at year 2, and 239 at year 3 (dropout rate <10%, so the decreasing number of participants over time is largely due to the fact that many participants had not yet reached year 3 of study participation at the time of data download). \n\nOver the 3-year period the mean MoCA score declined by approximately 1 point on average, and the frequency of participants screening positive for cognitive impairment (i.e., MoCA score <26) increased from 22% to 37%, with dementia-level impairment (i.e., MoCA score <21[ ]) increasing from 1% to 6% over time, see  . Cognitive impairment increased from 11% to 15% based on detailed neuropsychological test results. Using the site investigator\u2019s diagnostic determination, the diagnosis of MCI increased from 9% to 21% and PDD from 0% to 3%. \n   Cognitive outcomes over time.        \n\n### Neurobiological predictors of cognitive impairment \n  \n#### Global cognitive impairment (MoCA) \n  \nBaseline CSF, DAT imaging, DTI (MD and FA), and MRI (volume and thickness) values, and the eight SNPs examined, did not predict MoCA score <26 over time (data not shown). In the subset of patients with MRI data, baseline decreased entorhinal (p = 0.007) and superior temporal lobe (p = 0.004) volumes were associated with greater decline in MoCA score over time. \n\nLongitudinal DAT imaging did not predict MoCA score <26 over time. In the subset of patients with MRI data, decreased caudal middle frontal (p = 0.096), superior parietal (p = 0.03), and superior temporal (p = 0.08) volumes over time were associated with MoCA score <26 over time. Decreased lateral orbitofrontal (p = 0.05), superior parietal (p = 0.007), and superior temporal (p = 0.07) volumes, and decreased precentral thickness (p = 0.02), over time predicted greater decline in continuous MoCA score over time. \n\n\n#### Neuropsychological test-defined cognitive impairment \n  \nBaseline CSF, DAT imaging, DTI (MD and FA), and MRI (volume and thickness) values, and the eight SNPs examined, did not predict test-based cognitive impairment over time (data not shown). Likewise, longitudinal DAT imaging and MRI (volume and thickness) values did not predict test-based cognitive impairment over time (data not shown). \n\n\n#### Site investigator diagnosis of cognitive impairment \n  \n shows lower baseline ipsilateral caudate DAT availability and CSF A\u03b2 1\u201342 predicted cognitive impairment after FDR correction and on multivariable analysis. Smaller fusiform, lateral occipital, and lateral orbitofrontal (for MRI volume) and decreased inferior cerebellar peduncle MD (for DTI MD) predicted cognitive impairment in multivariable analyses, see  . \n   Baseline biomarker predictors of investigator diagnosis of cognitive impairment.      \n shows lower contralateral caudate DAT availability over time was associated with cognitive impairment in multivariable analyses. In addition, smaller fusiform and superior temporal lobe volumes, and larger caudal anterior cingulate and smaller fusiform thickness, over time were associated with cognitive impairment in multivariate analyses, see  . \n   Longitudinal biomarker predictors of investigator diagnosis of cognitive impairment.      \nExamining the entire cohort (i.e., excluding MRI variables) and including only patients who were cognitively intact at baseline (N = 394), baseline predictors of incident cognitive impairment (based on site investigator diagnosis) were lower CSF A\u03b2 1\u201342, lower ipsilateral caudate DAT availability,   COMT   val158met (val/val genotype), and   BDNF   val66met (val/val genotype), see  . A longitudinal biomarker predictor of incident cognitive impairment was decreased contralateral putamen DAT availability (p = 0.07). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this multi-modal longitudinal examination of predictors of cognitive impairment in early PD, the biomarkers in general predicting cognitive impairment that remained significant in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency; (2) brain-wide decreased volume or thickness; (3) white matter tract abnormalities; (4) possible co-morbid AD pathology; and (5) genetic SNPs summarized in  . \n\nBy year three after PD diagnosis, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 15\u201337% participants and increased in frequency by 50\u2013200% over this time period depending on the criteria applied, consistent with the relatively high frequency[ ,  ] and worsening over time[ ] reported in other early PD cohorts. \n\nThere were no biological predictors of neuropsychological test-defined impairment; one possible explanation is that the smallest percentage of participants fulfilled this criterion for cognitive impairment over time (15% versus either 24% or 37% for the other criteria). The greatest evidence for biomarkers predicting cognitive decline in this early, relatively cognitively intact population occurred when using the site investigator\u2019s annual diagnosis of cognitive impairment. \n\nWe found that both caudate and putamen DAT deficits, either at disease onset or worsening over time, predicted cognitive impairment. This confirms previous cross-sectional and longitudinal research in early PD using DAT[ ] or other striatal dopamine system imaging ligands[ ]. These findings suggest that enhancing dopamine function in early PD might improve cognitive abilities, at least acutely or temporarily[ ], and that serial DAT imaging might serve as a cognitive biomarker in PD cognition studies. \n\nLower CSF A\u03b2 1\u201342 levels, suggestive of co-morbid AD A\u03b2 amyloid brain deposition, have been associated with memory impairment in de novo PD patients[ ] and as well as future cognitive decline[ ,  ]. AD pathology is associated with increasing age in PD, but here an association was shown between cognitive impairment and baseline A\u03b2 1\u201342 levels, when the mean age of patients was only 62 years, suggesting that AD-related changes in PD can occur at a relatively young age and long prior to the development of dementia, as reported for MCI in the general population[ ] and in preliminary PD neuropathological studies[ ]. \n\nMultiple, widely spread brain regions of decreased volume, and to a lesser extent thickness, predicted cognitive impairment, and for some brain regions cognitive impairment was predicted by ongoing atrophy, including frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe regions. These findings overlap with previous findings of temporal-parietal and frontal atrophy and thinning with MCI in early PD [ ]. It is possible that the cortical atrophy observed in vivo using structural MRI is associated with cortical PD- or AD-related neuropathological changes, which would be consistent with neuropathology studies showing that both cortical LBD pathology and co-morbid A\u03b2 amyloid plaque deposits are associated with cognitive impairment in PD[ ]. \n\nSpecific brain regions (associated cognitive function) implicated included the lateral occipital (object recognition and spatial vision), lateral orbitofrontal (executive abilities), and entorhinal (memory) cortices, subserving cognitive abilities that can be impaired early in the course of PD. The latter finding is consistent with recent research that medial temporal lobe atrophy is associated with cognitive impairment and decline in non-demented PD patients[ ]. \n\nNeither increased MD nor decreased FA predicted cognitive impairment. Previous research in de novo PD reported an association between increased MD in frontal and parietal white matter tracts and specific cognitive tests[ ]. Cohort and study design differences may in part explain these discrepant findings, but the analyses performed here were more stringent than those utilized in previous research. \n\nTwo SNPs associated with cognitive decline, the   COMT   val158met SNP and   BDNF   val66met. There is a complex association between the   COMT   val158met SNP and cognition in PD, influenced by both disease severity and use of dopaminergic medication[ ]. In our analyses, the high activity   COMT   val158met genotype was associated with cognitive impairment. Regarding   BDNF  , its product is important for survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. A recent study found that the   BDNF   val-allele carriers had great decline in executive abilities over time, consistent with our findings [ ]. \n\nUnlike some previous studies, we did not show an association between   ApoE4   or   MAPT   status and cognitive impairment. For   ApoE4  , it is important to note that most previous studies have focused on PD patients with dementia[ ], and the PPMI sample is relatively young and cognitively intact. For   MAPT  , the H1 haplotype has been associated with cognitive decline or dementia in some[ ] but not all[ ] PD studies. Longer duration of follow up of this cohort will unveil if genetic risks are important in later-onset or more advanced cognitive dysfunction. \n\nStrengths of the study are inclusion of multiple and international sites; the relatively large sample size; inclusion of multiple biomarkers, including some obtained serially; enrollment of participants starting at symptom onset; annual cognitive and clinical assessments; use of four definitions of cognitive impairment; and a stringent, multi-step statistical analysis plan. Limitations include: highly educated and overwhelmingly white cohort limiting generalizability; variable sample sizes for the different biomarkers, with less than half the patients having research quality MRI scans for inclusion; although CSF is collected serially in PPMI, currently only baseline values are available; the cognitive battery utilized in PPMI is limited and the site investigator\u2019s diagnosis of cognitive impairment was available for the entire cohort only starting at year two; other biomarkers associated with early cognitive decline in PD (e.g., measures of cholinergic integrity and FDG-PET) are not included in PPMI; and lack of comparison with the healthy controls enrolled in PPMI to assess the disease specificity of our findings. \n\nCognitive decline in early PD is independently predicted by multiple biomarker changes, including nigrostriatal dopamine system deficits, wide-ranging atrophy consistent with cortical neurodegenerative disease, evidence for co-morbid AD pathology, and genetic factors. This provides confirmation for heterogeneity in the neural substrate of the early cognitive deficits in PD, and highlights the need to incorporate multiple biomarkers when risk factors for cognitive decline. Validation and extension of these findings will help in the design of clinical trials for cognitive impairment in PD, including those testing possible disease-modifying therapies from disease onset, and also be a step toward personalized medicine. \n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5435130, "text_md5": "b5975e83db13b54b4b5ae311ec0154b8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 448], "journal": [449, 457], "publication_year": [459, 463], "title": [474, 588], "keywords": [602, 602], "abstract": [615, 2666], "body": [2675, 29773]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 28520803, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0175674", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435130", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5435130"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435130\">5435130</a>", "list_title": "PMC5435130  Multiple modality biomarker prediction of cognitive impairment in prospectively followed de novo Parkinson disease"}

Exercise is recommended as an adjunct to traditional treatments for improving gait, balance, and quality of life. Among the exercise approaches known to improve walking, tango and treadmill training have recently emerged as two promising therapies for improving gait, disease severity and quality of life, yet these two interventions have not been directly compared to each other. Prior studies have been helpful in identifying interventions effective in improving gait function, but have done little to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying functional improvements. The primary objective of the proposed work is to compare the effects of three community-based exercise programs, tango, treadmill training and stretching, on locomotor function in individuals with PD. In addition, we aim to determine whether and how these interventions alter functional connectivity of locomotor control networks in the brain. \n\n\n## Methods/Design \n  \nOne hundred and twenty right-handed individuals with idiopathic PD who are at least 30\u00a0years of age will be assigned in successive waves to one of three community-based exercise groups: tango dancing, treadmill training or stretching (control). Each group will receive three months of exercise training with twice weekly one-hour group classes. Each participant will be evaluated at three time points: pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention (3\u00a0months), and follow-up (6\u00a0months). All evaluations will include assessment of gait, balance, disease severity, and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention evaluations will also include task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state functional connectivity MRI. All MRI and behavioral measures will be conducted with participants OFF anti-Parkinson medication, with behavioral measures also assessed ON medication. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study will provide important insights regarding the effects of different modes of exercise on locomotor function in PD. The protocol is innovative because it: 1) uses group exercise approaches for all conditions including treadmill training, 2) directly compares tango to treadmill training and stretching, 3) tests participants OFF medication, and 4) utilizes two distinct neuroimaging approaches to explore mechanisms of the effects of exercise on the brain. \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \nClinicalTrials.gov  . \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, affecting 1\u20131.5 million Americans [ ]. Numerous non-motor and motor symptoms including gait dysfunction characterize PD. Gait dysfunction frequently causes substantial and early difficulties in people with PD and may represent the leading edge of disability [ ]. Reduced speed and stride length contribute to gait dysfunction [ , ]. These gait difficulties not only affect forward walking, but also impair backward walking, during which gait speed and stride length are reduced to a greater degree relative to healthy controls [ , ]. While pharmacological and surgical approaches to the management of PD can help to partially alleviate some gait problems, they do not completely address the issue, indicating a need for additional and complementary approaches to the treatment of gait in PD. Numerous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of exercise as a complementary treatment for improving gait function in PD. Among the exercise approaches known to improve walking function, tango and treadmill training have recently emerged as two promising therapies for improving gait while also reducing disease severity and improving quality of life (for reviews see [ - ]), yet tango and treadmill training have not been directly compared to each other. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying these interventions remains to be elucidated. Neuroimaging may be a means to investigate these underlying mechanisms \n\nInvestigations of gait-related dysfunction in humans is particularly challenging. Neuroimaging may provide a means to investigate the role of exercise interventions in individuals with PD, but this approach presents a challenge due to difficulties collecting neuroimaging data during a gait task. Alternatively, imaging during an imagined walking task can provide insights into underlying brain mechanisms related to gait in healthy controls [ , ] and those with neurological disorders [ , ]. This imagined task activates networks involved with actual walking [ ]. Another neuroimaging method that can be used to investigate brain networks related to locomotion networks uses resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI), which assesses brain activity at rest and therefore eliminates the need to evoke actual or imagined locomotor behaviors. In contrast to task-related activations, rs-fcMRI focuses on spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal at rest; regional fluctuations in these signals correlate with functionally related regions. Thus, rs-fcMRI identifies related networks within the resting state BOLD data, revealing functionally related resting state networks that can be quantified. [ ]. These rs-fcMRI methods identify common networks in healthy individuals and can detectchanges in these networks related to a variety of neurological disorders\\(for review see [ ]). Resting state-functional connectivity MRI holds great promise as a potential biomarker for progression of disease, elucidating compensatory mechanisms associated with disease processes, informing targeting of neurosurgical treatments, and investigating new treatment strategies. rs-fcMRI has not yet been applied to study the effects of exercise on functional brain networks in humans with PD. \n\nTo investigate and compare the mechanisms underlying various PD exercise training approaches, we plan to conduct a 5-year, prospective, randomized, blinded study of a cohort of persons with PD. The main objective of this study will be to determine the effects of tango, treadmill training, and stretching (control) exercise on locomotor function and other aspects of PD. Additionally, we aim to determine how exercise impacts activity of specific brain regions and networks involved in locomotion using task-based and rs-fcMRI. \n\nWe hypothesize that tango and treadmill training will show similar improvement with forward walking performance, but only tango will improve backward walking performance. Tango and treadmill training will similarly improve disease severity. Additionally, tango will result in large improvements in balance and quality of life compared to treadmill training and stretching. With neuroimaging, we hypothesize that a differential BOLD signal increase will be observed in regions of interest during imagined forward walking following tango and treadmill training, and during imagined backward walking following tango only. Additionally, following tango and treadmill training, rs-fcMRI coherence in the motor network will be increased and will correlate with improvements in gait performance. No significant rs-fcMRI or task-related BOLD signal changes will occur in the stretching group. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis project is a 5-year, prospective, randomized controlled trial (Figure\u00a0 ). Participant will be assigned to one of three different exercise groups (tango, treadmill, stretching). Assessments will be conducted at three time points: pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention (3\u00a0months), and follow-up (6\u00a0months). The primary variable of interest is gait velocity in both forward and backward walking. Secondary variables include motor sign severity (Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-subsection III), balance (mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest)), and quality of life (Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39). All evaluations will be administered by a research physical therapist. The MDS-UPDRS-III and mini-BESTest measures will be video recorded and evaluated separately by a Movement Disorders neurologist, who will be blinded to the group assignment, assessment time point, and medication status of each participant. Information on current medications and dosages will be collected at all evaluations so that changes in medication over the course of the study can be noted and controlled for during statistical analyses. Participants will also undergo separate task-based and rs-fcMRI to explore the effects of these exercise interventions on brain activity. We will focus on locomotor network activity within specific regions of interest including the premotor area, supplementary motor area, primary somatosensory cortex, putamen, and cerebellum. We will also correlate changes in connectivity with changes in motor performance. This study is approved by the Human Research Protection Office at the Washington University School of Medicine and meets all guidelines associated with human subject research. All participants will provide written and informed consent prior to participation in this study.   \n Diagram showing the flow of participants through the study.  \n  \n\n\n### Participant selection \n  \nOne hundred and twenty right-handed participants with idiopathic PD who are at least 30\u00a0years of age will be recruited through the Washington University School of Medicine\u2019s Movement Disorders Center, Volunteers for Health database, and the Greater St. Louis Area Chapter of American Parkinson Disease Association. Participants must be diagnosed with clinically defined \u201cdefinite PD\u201d, as previously described by Racette et al. [ ] based upon established criteria [ - ]. Each participant must: 1) have clear benefit from levodopa, 2) be classified between Hoehn & Yahr stages I-IV, and 3) be able to walk independently with or without an assistive device for at least three meters. Participants will be randomly recruited from our community and assigned to interventions in blocks of 10\u201316 participants per wave. Three or four waves of each exercise group will be conducted as needed to achieve the desired sample size. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nAll physical evaluations and MRI scans will be conducted OFF medication, i.e. after a minimum 12-hour withdrawal of all anti-Parkinson medications. Evaluations for a single individual will always take place at the same time of day for all visits. MRI scans will also take place at the same time of day but on a separate date as close as possible to the associated date of evaluation. During the physical evaluation, participants will be evaluated first during the OFF medication period, given their normal dosage of anti-Parkinson medication, and then re-evaluated during the ON medication phase after a 45\u201360 minute waiting period to allow the medication to take effect. OFF medication measures will provide more accurate information about disease severity and effects of the disease on physical function without the confound of medication masking some symptoms, while ON medication measures will provide information about participant function in their everyday medicated state  .   During evaluations, participants will be allowed to rest as often as needed. Measures to be collected at each physical evaluation are included in Table\u00a0 . At the pre- and post-intervention time points, each participant will undergo task-based fMRI and rs-fcMRI scans as detailed below in   MRI Protocol  . Demographic information will be collected at baseline only and will include age, gender, height, weight, and duration of PD symptoms.   \n Outcome measures administered at each evaluation  \n  \n\n\n### MRI protocol \n  \nMRI data will be collected on a Siemens 3.0\u00a0T TrioTim scanner located in Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology Neuroimaging Laboratory at the Washington University School of Medicine. \n\nDuring each visit participants will have 2 structural scans: a T1-weighted (T1W) sagittal, magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE, Repetition Time (TR) =2400\u00a0ms, TI\u2009=\u20091000\u00a0ms, Echo Time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.16\u00a0ms, Flip Angle (FA)\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, 0.9\u00a0mm \u00a0voxels, 8:09\u00a0min) and a T2-weighted (T2W) fast spin echo (TR\u2009=\u20093200\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u2009455\u00a0ms, 1.0\u00a0mm \u00a0voxels, 4:43\u00a0min). At each session, gradient and shim coil currents will be adjusted to correct for spatial inhomogeneities using the scanner\u2019s multi-axis-projection shim program. A midsagittal scout T1W spin-echo pulse sequence will be used for positioning. Resting state-functional connectivity MRI data will be acquired via two T2*-weighted gradient echo multislice BOLD sensitized fMRI scans (Echo Planar Imaging (EPI); TR\u2009=\u20092200\u00a0ms, TE =3\u00a0ms, 4.0\u00a0mm \u00a0voxels, 7:30-per scan, 200 frames). BOLD scans will capture 36 slices covering the brain and the cerebellum. During the rs-fcMRI scan, the participant is instructed to remain alert but relaxed with their eyes closed. Participants are monitored via an MRI-compatible eye tracker during data collection to ensure that their eyes remain closed throughout each session. Resting state data will be acquired prior to any imagined walking scans. The imagined walking component will consist of an additional two T2*-weighted gradient echo multislice BOLD sensitized fMRI scans (EPI; TR\u2009=\u20092200\u00a0ms, TE\u2009=\u20093\u00a0ms, 4.0\u00a0mm \u00a0voxels, 7:30-per scan, 200 frames), acquired while the participant views a cue or null condition on a mirror mounted to the head coil. Cues will be generated via a custom made ePrime program using the design shown in Figure\u00a0 .   \n Illustration of boxcar design for imagined walking tasks.  \n  \n\nTo ensure adherence and maximize vividness of the imagined tasks, we will utilize a variable distance cued gait task. This method has been described previously [ ]. In brief, prior to beginning the scanning sessions, each individual will practice performing and imagining three tasks: walking forward, walking backward, and quiet standing. Forward and backward walking tasks will be completed at four and eight meters. Following each practiced gait task, the participant will be seated and given a stopwatch. They will then be asked to close their eyes and visualize themselves standing on the start-line. When they are able to clearly see them self in position they will press the stopwatch button and beginning imagining themselves walking the indicated distance from the first person perspective. With their eyes closed they will continue to imagine themselves walking down the hall until they cross the finish-line for the specified distance. At this point they should press the stopwatch button a second time to stop the timer. \n\nOnce in the MRI scanner, participants will be instructed to imagine walking forward or backward for four or eight meters. In addition to the walking tasks, participants will also imagine themselves standing quietly or performing a \u201crest\u201d. As described previously [ , ], imagined stand trials will be collected during a separate acquisition. An fMRI compatible response pad (Mag Design and Engineering, Redwood City, CA) will be used to record the task initiation and termination times, thus allowing for assessment of task completion intervals. Any participant who does not appropriately scale their response to the change in task interval will be excluded from further analyses. Furthermore, each participant will be directly observed during each scan to check for any spurious movements of the limbs or body. If seen, then this BOLD run will be stopped and the person reminded to try to hold still. \n\nProcessing of fMRI BOLD data for the imagined walking conditions will be completed in Brain Voyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and using custom Matlab scripts (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). To facilitate comparison of anatomical locations across all participants, transformation of T1 weighted scans into Talairach space will be completed prior to functional data alignment [ ]. Blood oxygenated level dependent data will undergo 3D motion correction and alignment to the T1W anatomical data prior to post hoc comparisons. Comparisons between stimuli will be done using an eight predictor general linear model (GLM). The hemodynamic response function will be accounted for within the GLM model. \n\nProcessing of BOLD rs-fcMRI data will follow the methods of Fox et al. [ ] and include compensation for systematic, slice-dependent time shifts, elimination of systematic odd-even slice intensity differences due to interleaved acquisition, rigid-body correction for head motion within and across runs, and normalization of the signal intensity across each run (skipping the first two frames) to obtain a whole-brain mode value of 1000. Atlas transformation will be achieved by composition of affine transforms connecting the first functional volume (averaged over all fMRI runs after cross-run realignment) with the T2W and T1W structural images. Common mode image registration (to correct for head motion within and across fMRI runs and affine warping of T1W images to our atlas image) will be done using standard algorithms. Cross-modal registration (e.g., T2W to T1W images) will be performed using vector gradient measure maximization. Linear trends across runs will be removed voxel-wise, and the data will be low-passed filtered retaining frequencies below 0.1Hz. Several sources of spurious variance will be removed by regression of the following nuisance variables and their first derivatives: (1) the 6 parameters resulting from rigid body correction for head motion; (2) a signal from a ventricular region of interest (ROI); (3) and a signal from a white matter ROI. BOLD data from each rs-fcMRI run will be resampled to 2-mm cubic voxels in atlas space for final analyses. Rigorous QA measures will be applied to minimize the impact of motion artifacts and movement confound. fMRI runs in which head motion exceeds 0.6\u00a0mm rms or the voxel-wise temporal standard deviation averaged over the brain (after full preprocessing) exceeds 0.5% will be excluded. Volumes with large changes in signal intensity (DVARS\u2009>\u20090.5%) will be excluded. Participants with more than 15% volumes removed also will be excluded [ ]. \n\n\n### Intervention groups \n  \nAll groups will participate in community-based group exercise, attending one-hour sessions twice per week for twelve weeks. Each class will include a brief warm up and cool down with 45\u00a0minutes of the hour devoted to the specific exercise. \n\n\n### Tango \n  \nArgentine tango classes will be modeled on those from previous studies, as described in Hackney & Earhart [ , ]. Participants in the Tango class will dance both leading and following roles to ensure that everyone spends time moving forward and backward. Participants will also change partners frequently to ensure they get experience dancing with many different partners. Tango partners will be individuals without PD and will include spouses and caregivers of those with PD as well as healthy volunteers. A syllabus and standardized musical selections will be utilized to ensure that all waves of the tango class are consistent. \n\n\n### Treadmill \n  \nParticipants in the treadmill class will walk at their self-selected comfortable over-ground walking pace in order to exercise at intensities comparable to the tango class. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that training at preferred speed for longer durations is more effective in enhancing gait than training at higher intensity for shorter blocks of time [ , ]. Over ground walking speed will be reassessed every week and the treadmill speed will be adjusted accordingly to ensure it matches over ground walking speed. To match the social aspect of the tango, where one interacts with a partner, treadmills will be arranged in clusters so that each individual has a walking partner with whom they can interact with during training. As with tango, people will be required to change partners frequently throughout a session. Treadmill classes will use the same musical selections as the tango classes. \n\n\n### Stretching \n  \nParticipants in the stretching class will be instructed by a trained physical therapist on stretching and flexibility exercises taken from the Be Active and Fitness Counts programs [ , ]. As with the other groups, each individual will be assigned a partner and will switch partners regularly during each session. Stretching classes will use the same musical selections as the tango and treadmill classes. \n\n\n### Primary outcome measure \n  \n#### Gait \n  \nSpatiotemporal features of gait will be measured at each evaluation using a five-meter instrumented, computerized walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems, Inc., Havertown, PA). The primary variable of interest from the GAITRite will be forward gait velocity. Additional variables of interest include stride length, stride length variability (CV), and gait asymmetry ([ , ]). Participants will perform three trials of each of the following walking conditions: 1) forward, 2) backward, 3) dual-task, and 4) fast as possible. Results from the three trials of each walking task will be averaged. For the dual-task condition, participants will be instructed to walk at their self-selected pace while completing a phonemic naming task. For the fast as possible condition, participants will be instructed to walk as quickly and safely as possible without running. \n\n\n\n### Secondary outcome measures \n  \nMotor sign severity will be measured at each evaluation using the MDS-UPDRS-III questionnaire. This section consists of 18 items pertaining to the cardinal motor features of PD, with each item rated on a 5 point (0\u20134) ordinal scale. Higher scores indicate greater PD motor sign severity. \n\nBalance will be measured at each evaluation using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BEST). This test includes 14 items addressing four balance systems: anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait stability. Each item is rated on a 3 point (0\u20132) ordinal scale. Lower scores indicate greater balance impairment. \n\nQuality of life will be measured at each evaluation using the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses PD-specific health related quality over the previous month. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life. \n\nEndurance will be measured at each evaluation using the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Participants will be instructed to walk, at a self-selected speed, as far a distance as possible over the span of 6\u00a0minutes. Participants will be allowed to use assistive devices but must stay consistent from evaluation to evaluation. \n\n\n### BOLD activity in imagined walking tasks \n  \nRegion of Interest (ROI) beta weight values for the general linear model contrasts (Forward vs. Rest and Backward vs. Rest) will be used to compare changes in BOLD signal values during imagined gait at the pre-test and post-test time points. \n\n\n### Functional connectivity \n  \nThe strength of correlations between brain regions will be used to assess changes in rs-fcMRI from pre-test to post-test. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe will employ a repeated measure (RM) ANOVA with group (tango, treadmill, and stretching) and time (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up) as factors to determine whether and how these interventions impact gait velocity. Similar analyses will also be performed for secondary variables of interest, including the MDS-UPDRS-III, Mini-BESTest, and PDQ-39  .   To analyze fMRI BOLD data, we will apply random effects (RFX) general linear model analysis using forward, backward and standing imagined tasks as individual predictors. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction of Q\u2009=\u20090.01 will be used to compensate for multiple comparisons. Significant clusters of voxels will be identified for pre- and post-intervention conditions. Additionally, the three groups will be compared to each other in the post-intervention condition using RFX ANCOVA. For analysis of rs-fcMRI data we will use an independent component analysis (ICA) to examine the strength of the correlation coefficients for anatomical regions identified as part of the locomotor control network, which include the premotor area, supplementary motor area, primary somatosensory cortex, putamen, and cerebellum. The strength of these correlations before and after the intervention will be compared via two-tailed RM ANOVAs with group and time as factors. Finally, we will correlate BOLD signal changes during the imagined walking tasks and changes in connectivity with changes in motor performance using Pearson or Spearman linear correlations as appropriate. The a-priori alpha level for analyses is set at 0.05. \n\n\n### Power analysis \n  \nWe used PASS software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT) to calculate statistical power based on preliminary data  .   Our primary variable of interest for behavioral data is gait velocity. Average forward gait velocity was 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0m/s and average backward gait velocity was 0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 in a sample of 60 individuals with PD (H&Y\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2) tested OFF medication in our laboratory over the past year for a different study. The current study has been powered to be able to detect differences of 1 standard deviation, or 0.1\u00a0m/s, which is equivalent to an effect size of 0.4. Changes of 0.1\u00a0m/s or more in gait velocity have been reported previously following both tango [ , , ] and treadmill training [ , - ]. With an effect size of 0.4, 27 participants per group will provide 89% power to detect differences between or within groups using two-tailed tests at a significance level of 0.05  .   Based upon our previous data, this sample size is also more than sufficient to adequately power our secondary variables (MDS-UPDRS-III, Mini-BESTest, and PDQ-39). \n\nSample sizes for imaging portions of this study were calculated based upon preliminary data from our lab and sources in the literature. To analyze fMRI BOLD data, our preliminary data from control participants before and after a single session of treadmill training indicate an effect size of 0.91 for change in beta weights (pre\u2009=\u2009\u22120.094\u2009\u00b1\u20090.111, post\u2009=\u20090.418\u2009\u00b1\u20090.116, Earhart laboratory unpublished data) using the cerebellum as an exemplar region during imagined forward walking. We recognize that responses in those with PD may be less pronounced than in controls and as such have used a conservative effect size of 0.45, half of that observed in controls, for our power calculation. Our preliminary imagined task-based fMRI BOLD data from people with PD (n\u2009=\u20098) indicate a beta weight of \u22120.075\u2009\u00b1\u20090.097, which is comparable to the value obtained from young controls at baseline. Utilizing the data from the sample with PD and an estimated effect size of 0.45, 18 subjects per groups will provide 80% power to detect differences between groups and 88% power to detect within group differences. Significant findings of differential BOLD signal changes have been localized to specific brain regions in PD populations during similar imagined walking MRI paradigms with a total of 12 PD participants per group [ ], further supporting that our proposed sample size is adequate. Utilizing rs-fcMRI to determine correlations between regions in the locomotor control network, we have powered the study to enable detection of differences in correlation coefficients of 0.1 (mean correlation\u2009=\u20091.0, SD\u2009=\u20090.1, p\u2009=\u20090.05, effect size\u2009=\u20090.44, per data from Wu et al. [ ] and our own preliminary data). We will have 80% power to detect between group differences and 88% power to detect within group differences with 18 subjects per group. \n\nBased upon our previous intervention studies [ ], we anticipate an attrition rate of approximately 15-20% due to dropouts or failure to complete the required minimum of 85% of classes. We also expect MRI-related exclusions due to head or body motion in roughly 30% of tested individuals  .   As such, we will recruit 40 subjects per group to account for attrition and data loss due to head or body motion and still obtain the needed final sample sizes for each aim. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study is innovative in several respects with two novel aspects that will potentially lay the foundation for many future studies. First, this will be the first study to perform a direct, head-to-head comparison of tango and treadmill training. Currently, it is unclear which of the interventions provides the largest improvement in gait, or which of these interventions may be better for improving PD motor symptoms, balance, and quality of life. This intervention study will address these questions and could lead to studies that combine these two treatment approaches into an exercise program that could be more effective than either intervention on its own. Second, the use of two distinct neuroimaging techniques, fMRI BOLD and rs-fcMRI, before and after intervention, will allow us to explore neurological mechanisms underlying changes in physical performance due to exercise training. The imaging techniques proposed herein will also lay the groundwork for us to answer many other questions regarding locomotor control mechanisms in PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4326476, "text_md5": "cfbe66de7c5e98bc55b9a98f25ba7e35", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 100], "journal": [101, 111], "publication_year": [113, 117], "title": [128, 268], "keywords": [282, 380], "abstract": [393, 2949], "body": [2958, 29642]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 25652002, "doi": "10.1186/s12883-015-0261-0", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326476", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4326476"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326476\">4326476</a>", "list_title": "PMC4326476  Comparing interventions and exploring neural mechanisms of exercise in Parkinson disease: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial"}

We assessed whether regional   MAPT   expression might be associated with selective vulnerability of global brain networks to neurodegenerative pathology. Using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging in progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson disease, and healthy subjects (n\u00a0= 128), we examined functional brain networks and measured the connection strength between 471 gray matter regions. We obtained   MAPT   and   SNCA   microarray expression data in healthy subjects from the Allen brain atlas. Regional connectivity varied according to the normal expression of   MAPT  . The regional expression of   MAPT   correlated with the proportionate loss of regional connectivity in Parkinson's disease. Executive cognition was impaired in proportion to the loss of hub connectivity. These effects were not seen with   SNCA  , suggesting that alpha-synuclein pathology is not mediated through global network properties. The results establish a link between regional   MAPT   expression and selective vulnerability of functional brain networks to neurodegeneration. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSeveral neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the hyperphosphorylation, misfolding, and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Genetic variations in the tau gene   MAPT   also increase the\u00a0risk of PSP, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease (PD) ( ,  ,  ), and dementia in PD ( ). Each of these disorders is associated with selective vulnerability of distinct brain regions within distributed functional brain networks ( ). Although there are suggestions that tau haplotype may contribute ( ) to its association with these diseases, the mechanisms behind this susceptibility remain unclear. \n\nThe misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau protein may provide a pathogenic template for the propagation and spread of tau pathology. For example, in transgenic murine models, it has been shown that tau can propagate via trans-synaptic spread ( ,  ), which promotes the transformation of normally expressed tau to pathogenic species ( ). Here, we propose that high levels of the intrinsic expression of tau in humans may enhance this templating process, thereby accelerating the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with tau and   MAPT  , by promoting the genesis and spread of the abnormal tau species. We predicted that brain regions with a higher expression of tau in healthy adulthood are more susceptible to a loss of function in the human diseases. We predict this would be true in neurodegenerative syndromes associated with tau pathology such as PSP, as well as other diseases associated with genetic variation of   MAPT   such as PD. To test this hypothesis, we examined the regional expression of   MAPT   in a cohort of healthy subjects from the Allen Brain atlas. \n\nWe contrasted the effect in   MAPT   with   SNCA  , the gene encoding alpha-synuclein, which is associated with the pathology of PD but not PSP. Alpha-synuclein neuropathology in PD is localized to brainstem nuclei and the basal ganglia in early PD ( ). In our population of PD subjects without dementia, we would therefore expect   SNCA   expression to have a limited effect on global network measures relevant to cognition. \n\nWe used functional brain networks to look for an association between genetic and clinical descriptions, both in a healthy older cohort and in neurodegeneration ( ,  ,  ). The\u00a0analysis of the organization of large scale functional brain networks in health and neuropsychiatric disease exploits the synchronization of activity across neuronal populations in functionally and anatomically defined networks ( ). Within these distributed networks, highly connected hub regions enhance network efficiency by connecting topologically remote regions ( ,  ). However, highly connected \u201chub\u201d regions may be particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease ( ) and other brain disorders ( ). \n\nWe therefore started by examining the association between functional connection strength in health and gene expression, then went on to associate connection strength and gene expression with the proportional loss of connection strength in PSP. We focused on hub regions to explore the link between functional connection strength and cognition in PD and PSP. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nA total of 146 subjects (60 age-matched controls, 30 PD without dementia Mini-Mental State Examination >26/30, 56 PSP) were recruited with written informed consent and approval from the local ethics committee. Of these, 16 were excluded after functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) image preprocessing revealed a focal lesion, significant white matter hyperintensities, or motion dependent confounds on connectivity measures. In the remaining 128 participants (53 controls, 30 PD, 45 PSP), there were no group differences in age, gender, handedness or years of education; as expected, cognition was more impaired in PD and PSP groups using the MMSE ( ). For motor function, we report both the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and for motor and nonmotor symptoms in the PSP group, the PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) ( ). Verbal fluency testing required subjects to generate words beginning with the letter \u201cp\u201d (letter fluency) or animals (category fluency), each for 1 minute. These 2 scores were added together to produce a combined verbal fluency score. \n\nMicroarray data from 6 postmortem brain samples were obtained from the Allen Institute at   (H0351.1009, H0351.1016, H0351.1015, H0351.2002, H0351.1012, and H0351.2001), mean age 45.5 (range 24\u201357), all male, 4 right-handed, 1 left-handed, and 1 ambidextrous. \n\n\n### Image preprocessing \n  \nImaging was performed at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, on a 3T Tim TRIO Siemens MRI scanner. Medication was not altered before scanning. Task-free echo-planar fMRI was acquired for a minimum of 145 volumes with subjects instructed to keep their eyes open (repetition time [TR]\u00a0= 2\u00a0seconds, echo time [TE]\u00a0= 30\u00a0ms, flip angle\u00a0= 78\u00b0, voxel size\u00a0= 3\u00a0\u00d7 3\u00a0\u00d7 3.75\u00a0mm) and structural Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Acquisition with Gradient Echo scanning in the same session (TR\u00a0= 2.3\u00a0seconds, TE\u00a0= 2.98, flip angle\u00a0= 9\u00b0, voxel size\u00a0= 1\u00a0mm isotropic). \n\nPreprocessing of structural scans involved optimized skull-stripping for atrophied brains ( ) using affine transformation followed by nonlinear warping using the FSL FNIRT tool to a group-specific template to ameliorate the challenge of warping atrophied brains before nonlinear transformation to Montreal Neuroscience Institute (MNI) standard space. Functional image preprocessing was tailored to minimize the effect of motion, which can influence the correlation between distance and connectivity ( ), and atrophy in neurodegenerative disease. The pipeline used a customized version of the fMRI signal processing toolbox ( ) and included discarding the first 5 volumes, slice-timing correction, coregistration to the Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Acquisition with Gradient Echo image, motion correction, regression of motion derivatives, white matter and CSF signal, local median despiking, high-pass band filtering of 0.01\u00a0Hz, and normalization to MNI standard space using parameters obtained from normalization of the structural image (performed in the described order). Quality control included (1) visual inspection at each preprocessing stage; and (2) measuring the influence of motion on correlation assessed using delta-BOLD and framewise displacement correlations, in a modified protocol from   and  . More specifically, subjects were excluded if there was greater than 5-mm framewise displacement between any 2 TR intervals and if there was a significant correlation between motion and the change in BOLD signal measured by wavelet correlation before and after a \u201cscrubbing\u201d procedure (delta-BOLD). \n\n\n### Network analysis \n  \nA parcellation scheme divided gray matter of the MNI standard space template in to 500 nonoverlapping regions of equal size, using centroidal Voronoi tessellation ( ). After the random selection of 500 centroids, each region was constructed by assigning the remaining voxels to one of the different centroids. This regional allocation was performed by minimizing the Euclidean distance between each voxel and the set of centroids, thereby producing a 3-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. When ties occurred, these were broken using random allocation. Consequently, each region was composed of contiguous voxels with a mean size of 364.7 voxels (sd 176.7). \n\nOf the 500 regions, 29 were insufficiently covered by the fMRI scans in some subjects, leaving 471 brain regions for further analysis. Individual subjects' association matrices were constructed by extracting a time series from each parcel and performing a wavelet decomposition using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform and a Daubechie wavelet filter using the brainwaver package in R ( ). The second band of 4 corresponding to a frequency range of 0.0675\u20130.125\u00a0Hz was selected for further analysis ( ). Graphs were constructed from association matrices without thresholding (negative weights retained) and based on the Fisher z-transforms of the correlation coefficients, and after wavelet decompositions of the fMRI time series. Network analysis was carried out in python 2.7\u00a0using the Maybrain package in python ( ) drawing on the networkx package (1.8.1,  ). \n\nFor comparison with microarray data, a mean association matrix was constructed for each diagnostic group. This was generated by calculating the mean connection strength of each brain region from all subjects within a diagnostic group. \n\n\n### Hub definition and connectivity loss \n  \nVerbal fluency scores were correlated with the mean connection strength of the most highly connected \u201chub\u201d regions. In the\u00a0context of this paper, a hub was defined as brain region whose\u00a0connection strength (the sum of all its connections) was above a threshold of 1.5 standard deviations of the mean connection strengths of all regions, based on the association matrix in control\u00a0subjects (see   demonstrating the location of hubs). \n\nThe proportion of connectivity loss between the control group and PD or PSP group was calculated as the difference in connection strength between groups for each brain region normalized by the connectivity in the control group ( ). Note that proportionate, rather than absolute, loss of hub connectivity is used, as hubs have by definition higher absolute connectivity, whereas our hypotheses refer to the proportionate vulnerability of hubs to the progression of neuropathology. \n\n\n### Microarray analysis \n  \nMicroarray data available from the Allen brain atlas was generated using an Agilent 8\u00a0\u00d7 60\u00a0K array, custom-designed by Beckman Coulter Genomics. From this data, we identified 4 probes for the   MAPT   gene (A_23_P207699, A_24_P224488, A_32_P143793, and CUST_449_PL1416408490) and 2 probes for the   SNCA   gene (A_32_P109653 and A_23_29,939). The specificity of each probe was reassessed using nucleotide BLAST ( ) to identify genes and translated nucleotide sequences associated with each probe's sequence. Three of the 4   MAPT   probes met our criteria: 100% homology with an area within the   MAPT   gene and associated transcripts and no other regions of homology, with very small E values to suggest good sensitivity. These 3 probes matched regions in the   MAPT   gene, A_23_P207699 and A_24_P224488 homologous with the gene sequence to target complementary DNA and A_32_P143793 with the anti-sense sequence targeting complementary RNA.   MAPT   has 17 exons and is alternately spliced into 6 isoforms, with 2 main groups differentiated by 3 or 4 repeats of the binding domain as a result of alternate splicing of exon 10. All probes recognized 3 and 4 repeat tau. The fourth probe (CUST_449_PL1416408490) showed only 88% homology with   MAPT   and 80% homology with a region on chromosome 18 and was discarded. Two probes in the Allen brain atlas data labeled as targeting   SNCA   (A_32_P109653 and A_23_29939) had 100% homology with regions in the   SNCA   gene with small E values. Both probes were homologous with complementary DNA. Further detail on the microarray analysis methodology is available from the Allen Institute ( ). \n\n\n### Comparison between microarray and functional network data \n  \nThere were 3 challenges in identifying homologous regions between the genetic and imaging data: (1) only 2 Allen subjects have data from both hemispheres; (2) regions in the Allen data set are not evenly spaced; and (3) the number and precise location of regions differ between Allen subjects. To address the challenge of missing data from the right hemisphere in 4 Allen subjects, the remaining 2 subjects were used to correlate microarray expression data between the hemispheres. We used the remaining 2 subjects with whole brain data to assess whether it was reasonable to use the single hemisphere data from the other 4 subjects to represent whole brain. For each brain region, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (Fisher's r-to-z transformed to enable statistical comparison) between the expression values of each hemisphere for 29,131 probes associated with an identified gene. Data for the null hypothesis were generated by permuting interhemispheric brain regions for 10,000 random region pairs. There was a significant difference between observed and permuted data for both subjects; subject A mean z\u00a0= 0.46,   p   < 0.00001, subject B mean z\u00a0= 0.40,   p   < 0.00001. We therefore analyzed   MAPT   and   SNCA   data under the assumption of symmetry of gene expression. \n\nTo address the second challenge of different spatial distributions between imaging and genetic data, each imaging region was associated with the nearest brain region from all Allen subjects combined. Finally, each Allen brain region's anatomical label was used to identify comparable regions across the 6 Allen subjects, in standard anatomical space. Each of the 471 imaging regions was then paired with an anatomically labeled region of the Allen atlas (see   demonstrating regions of the Allen brain atlas included in the final analysis). For each region, the gene expression value was calculated as the mean of all samples falling in to the appropriate brain regions from all 6 Allen subjects. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed in R (Version 3.0.1  ). Groupwise differences in node degree were tested using a   t   test with   p  -values obtained using permutation testing (5000 permutations) and corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate ( ). Correlation between   MAPT   or   SNCA   expression and node degree used the Pearson correlation coefficient and   p  -values estimated from permutation testing. To assess the relationship between verbal fluency and the proportional loss of connection strength in PD and PSP, a 1-way analysis of variance was performed assessing the main effect of connection strength on verbal fluency. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe measured functional connectivity among 471 of 500 gray matter regions during task-free (or \u201cresting-state\u201d) fMRI in 128 subjects: 30 people with PD, 45 people with PSP, and 53 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Our principal measure of connectivity was the sum of connection weights to all other regions (hereafter connection strength), derived from the association matrix of z-transformed wavelet correlations. To assess the relationship between functional connection strength and gene expression, we extracted the   MAPT   expression for each of 3   MAPT   probes and 2   SNCA   probes in 6 subjects from the Allen Brain Atlas.   illustrates the intersubject variation (i.e., standard deviation) in gene expression for each probe. The expression values were normalized for each probe within each subject: the mean expression value for each probe was zero, and the standard deviation was 1 for each probe (across all regions).  A and B illustrate the regional differences in the magnitude of   MAPT   and   SNCA   gene expression. \n\nThere were positive correlations between   MAPT   expression and the connection strength in control subjects when values from all 3   MAPT   probes were combined (r\u00a0= 0.29,   p   \u2264 0.00001) and when examined separately ( C). The expression of   SNCA   did not correlate with connection strength when combining data across both probes (r\u00a0= 0.08,   p   > 0.1), although the expression values of 1 probe correlated weakly with connection strength (A 32 P109653, r\u00a0= 0.12,   p  \u00a0= 0.036, see  ). Next, we related these effects to PD and PSP. \n\nWe assessed whether regions of high connection strength were susceptible to the effect of neurodegeneration in PD and PSP by measuring the proportional loss of connection strength across each of the 471 brain regions ( ). It is expected that regions with more connections would lose more of these in absolute terms, but the hypothesis of selective vulnerability posits that well-connected regions lose a disproportionate number of connections; therefore, our analysis examined the proportional loss of connection strength. Brain regions with greater connection strength in controls lost the largest proportion of connection strength in PD (r\u00a0= 0.61,   p   < 0.00001 corrected) and PSP (r\u00a0= 0.44,   p   < 0.00001). Brain regions that lost the greatest proportion of connection strength also had greater expression of   MAPT   in PD (r\u00a0= 0.16,   p  \u00a0= 0.0014, corrected for multiple comparisons across 2 genes using a Bonferroni correction) but not in PSP (r\u00a0= 0.06,   p   > 0.1), and there were no significant associations with   SNCA   (PD: r\u00a0= 0.02,   p   > 0.1, PSP: r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.08,   p   > 0.1). \n\nFinally, we examined the relevance of connectivity changes to cognitive performance. Although PSP and PD have distinct clinical phenotypes, both diseases are associated with early impairment of executive function ( ), which can be indexed by verbal fluency ( ). We identified the most highly connected \u201chub\u201d brain regions (as previously mentioned) in control subjects and used the mean connection strength across hubs, applying analysis of covariance to account for the difference in distribution of verbal fluency scores of each group ( ). The mean verbal fluency scores were controls 40.3 (standard deviation 10.4), PD 34.3 (7.3), and PSP 14.1 (8.6). The connection strength of hub regions positively covaried with verbal fluency in both patient groups, that is, greater connection strength was associated with greater verbal fluency (F\u00a0= 6.1, df\u00a0= 1,   p  \u00a0= 0.02). There was no interaction between this covariance and diagnosis (F\u00a0= 1.3, df\u00a0= 1,   p   > 0.1), although post hoc correlations demonstrated that verbal fluency declined with the loss of hub connectivity in PD (PD: r\u00a0= 0.52, df\u00a0= 21,   p  \u00a0= 0.01; PSP: r\u00a0= 0.21, df\u00a0= 38,   p   > 0.1). Motor scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) did not correlate with a loss of connection strength (F\u00a0= 0.02, df\u00a0= 1,   p   > 0.1). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe have shown that the regional expression of the   MAPT   gene in health is associated with regions of high connectivity, which predict the functionally relevant loss of connectivity in PSP, a neurodegenerative diseases associated strongly with progressive misfolding and aggregation of the protein tau. Similar changes were observed in PD, which is more associated with alpha-synculein pathology but for which the risk of disease and accompanying dementia are associated with tau haplotypes. \n\nAccumulating evidence points to the susceptibility of highly connected hub regions to change in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disease ( ). This evidence includes neurodegenerative syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease, where the hub selectivity of connection strength has been linked to greater metabolic demands ( ). Highly connected brain regions can also be considered \u201cexpensive\u201d to maintain because they have large numbers of connections, which may make them vulnerable to disease processes because of their high metabolism ( ), or through \u201chub overload\u201d of information that would usually be managed by other disease-affected brain regions ( ). Furthermore, greater connectivity may increase the probability of transferring and receiving harmful protein species ( ,  ). \n\nOur findings extend these network-based hypotheses by linking global network properties directly to the underlying expression of native tau in humans. Global network properties have been found to mirror patterns in gene expression ( ,  ,  ), and more specifically, the association between   MAPT   expression and connection strength reflects the importance of the tau protein in maintaining axonal integrity by stabilizing microtubules ( ). In humans, previous imaging studies have linked single gene variants with patterns of change in brain imaging ( ,  ,  ). We go further to suggest that\u00a0the regional variation in the   MAPT   gene expression in health can contribute to the selective vulnerability of a densely connected region specifically, more highly connected regions may be intrinsically susceptible to neurodegeneration mediated by tau dysfunction. \n\nThe correlation between   MAPT   expression and the proportional loss of connection strength was greater in PD than for PSP. The variability between these 2 diseases suggests that multiple genes and disease processes are involved in the loss of functional connections between brain regions. Our approach was to test an hypothesis based on a known gene associated with cognitive changes in the 2 disorders of interest. A more exploratory approach investigating all the available microarray data in the Allen brain atlas is technically possible ( ) and may identify other contributing genes but would require careful control of type I statistical error. Our study was not powered to conduct such a study. \n\nIn contrast to   MAPT  , we did not find a strong association between   SNCA   expression and functional connectivity in health, or loss of connectivity in disease. There was a weak association between 1   SNCA   probe and connectivity in health, but this was not matched by changes in disease. This is despite the association of PD with alpha-synuclein pathology. Lewy bodies containing alpha-synuclein are the hallmark of PD pathology ( ), and there is now emerging evidence that alpha-synuclein could spread across neural networks and cause aggregation and cell loss through a prion-like process ( ,  ). There is a correlation between cortical deposition of alpha-synuclein and dementia ( ); however, our cohort of PD patients specifically excluded patients with dementia. We suggest that the role of alpha-synuclein in PD without dementia is not relevant to the more cortically derived network measures that we employed to examine large scale network functional connectivity. \n\nWe have examined functional connection strength across the whole brain, but the brain's functional network can be examined as a series of macroscopic brain networks, some of which have been associated with individual neurodegenerative diseases ( ). In the context of our results, the recent finding that gene expression may predict connectivity patterns ( ,  ) raises the possibility that gene expression patterns and their products may contribute to the susceptibility of specific brain networks to specific neurodegenerative pathologies. \n\nWe identified a clinical effect of destabilizing highly connected hub regions by demonstrating that verbal fluency declines with a loss of connection strength. Verbal fluency is a key component of early cognitive impairment in both PD and PSP ( ) and arises from the orchestrated function of multiple brain regions ( ). Therefore, a loss of the coordinating function of highly connected brain regions is expected to have a detrimental effect on verbal fluency. \n\nA strength of our study is the hypothesis-driven selection of genes relevant to PSP and PD. This contrasts with an exploratory data-driven approach ( ,  ), which may reduce the statistical power to detect relevant effects of individual genes. However, we recognize that there are likely to be other genes that play a role in the pathology underlying PD and PSP whose differential expression may contribute to pathogenesis. \n\nThere are a number of limitations to this study. First, the gene expression data and imaging data were necessarily obtained from different populations. Although our hypothesis was based on evidence for the involvement of tau in both PD and PSP, we recognize that gene-connectivity relationships may not exist in all disorders where there is a change in connectivity; and therefore, a more direct imaging-pathologic correlation in a single population would be the optimum approach. Second, the Allen database from which the gene expression data was derived includes only 6 subjects raising the possibility that interindividual variance may account for our findings. However, the main statistical comparison was among the 471 defined brain regions rather than the 6 individuals, and in 5 of the 6 subjects, we found similarly significant within-subject correlations between   MAPT   expression and connection strength demonstrating that our results were not dependent on 1 or 2 subjects. Finally, our results may not be specific for PD and PSP. It will be important to replicate our findings in independent cohorts and in other tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. \n\nIn conclusion, our results link molecular and imaging data in support of hypotheses of network vulnerability to neurodegenerative pathologies. We propose that brain regions expressing greater levels of the   MAPT   gene are more susceptible to neurodegeneration associated with the   MAPT   haplotype or mediated by tau pathology. \n\n\n## Disclosure statement \n  \nEdward T.

Further studies should be conducted with a special consideration of the ethnic diversity of the different populations. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease and was originally described by James Parkinson, in 1817, who discovered and described what he called \u201cEssay on the Shaking Palsy.\u201d The cardinal signs of PD are resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural reflex impairment. Other manifestations include psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression and dysautonomic symptoms such as hypotension and constipation, paresthesias, cramps, olfactory dysfunction, and seborrheic dermatitis. As the disease progresses, decreased cognitive ability may appear. On histopathology, PD is manifested as degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra resulting in loss of dopamine in the striatum. This may occur only when 50\u201360% of the nigral neurons are lost and about 80\u201385% of the dopamine content of the striatum is depleted [ ]. Pathological features including progressive loss of striatal dopamine are those of bradykinesia and rigidity, which relate to striatal dopamine deficiency and loss of SNc dopaminergic neurons [ ]. \n\nStudies on genetics of Parkinson's disease are worldwide and mutations are increasingly reported. The most frequent genes involved are   PINK1   and   PARK2   both of which are associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease [ ]. \n\nLinkage analysis of families with autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism mapped the   PARK2   locus to chromosome 6q26, near the sod2 locus. It encodes parkin, a 465-amino-acid protein that belongs to the \u201cring between ring fingers\u201d (RBR) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The RBR domain interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) to catalyze attachment of ubiquitin to protein targets, thus tagging these proteins for destruction by the proteosome [ ,  ]. \n\nReported mutations in   PARK2   exceed 100 including missense and nonsense mutations, as well as exonic deletions, rearrangements, and duplications [ ,  ]. \n\n PARK6   was first mapped to chromosome 1p35-p36 in a large consanguineous Italian family with autosomal recessive, early onset PD. Subsequently, phosphatase and tensin homolog- (PTEN-) induced putative kinase 1   (PINK1)   was determined to be the disease-causing gene.   PINK1   mutations have been reported to account for approximately 1% to 3% of early onset PD in populations of European ancestry [ ,  ], 8.9% of autosomal recessive PD in a sample of Japanese families [ ], and 2.5% of early onset PD in a sample of ethnic Chinese, Malays, and Indians. \n\nThe usage of in silico studies has strong impact on the identification of candidate SNPs since they are easy and less costly and can facilitate future genetic studies. The aim of this study was to identify the pathogenic SNPs in   PARK2   and   PINK1   using in silico prediction software and to determine the effect of these SNPs on the structure, function, and regulation of their respective proteins. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nSNPs in   PARK2   and   PINK1   were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information ( ). \n\n### 2.1. Analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism \n  \nWe carried out in silico prediction of structural effect of each SNP using   PolyPhen   tool (pph2, Polymorphism Phenotyping v2, version 2.1.0) [ ]. SNPs are also appraised quantitatively as benign, possibly damaging, and probably damaging. The program calculates position-specific independent count (PSIC) scores for every variant and estimates the differences between the variant scores. The software is found on the following link:  . Potentially damaging SNPs were further tested using   SIFT   [ ] online software. It classifies SNPs into neutral and deleterious and it calculates a probability based on that prediction. A tolerance index of <0.05 was considered deleterious.   I-mutant   2.0 [ ] was used to predict the effect of coding SNPs on the stability of the protein. The resultant variants were visualized using UCSF Chimera 2.0 software using phylogenetic and structural information to predict possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a human protein. \n\nWe carried out further prediction of noncoding SNPs using two more online software types: Regulomedb [ ] which integrates a large collection of regulatory information and an approach that enables the functional assignment of regulatory information onto any set of variants derived from genomic sequencing or GWAS studies. It functions through aligning SNPs with regulatory information and then comparing them to different types of transcription factor data set. The scoring system of it is based on increasing confidence that a variant lies in a functional location and likely results in a functional consequence. Noncoding SNPs were analyzed using Regulomedb, MIRSNP, and   SNP Function Prediction   [ ] to determine their effects on transcription factor binding, miRNA binding, and splicing database, which merge data set from computational, experimental, and epidemiological studies with genomewide association studies result and linkage disequilibrium information to prioritize SNPs for further genetic mapping studies. This software can predict SNPs with transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) activity; premature termination of amino acid sequence (stop codons); changing of splicing pattern or efficiency by disrupting splice site, exonic splicing enhancers (ESE), or silencers (ESS); alteration of protein structures or properties by changing single amino acids; or regulation of protein translation by affecting microRNA (miRNA) binding sites activity. \n\nFor SNPs within the 3\u2032UTR region we used   MIRSNPs   [ ] online software, which contains human SNPs in predicted miRNA-mRNA binding sites based on information from dbSNP135 and mirBASE18. It performs sequence alignment between 20\u2009bp DNA sequences surrounding 3\u2032UTR SNPs and the corresponding mRNA sequences. SNPs were classified into four groups, labeled as create, enhance, decrease, or break. \n\n SNPs Stability Prediction  \n\n 3D Modeling and Visualization  .   UCSF Chimera   [ ] is a program used to visualize the modeled PDP files and take images. It is used to visualize and analyze molecular structural data like supramolecular assemblies, sequence alignment, docking result, and conformational assemblies. \n\n\n\n## 3. Result \n  \n PARK2  . Twenty-nine thousand and nine hundred and sixty-four SNPs of PARK2 gene were retrieved from dbSNP of which twenty-nine thousand, seven hundred and fifty-two SNPs (99.3%) were found intronic. 69 SNPs (0.2%) were found to be missense, twenty-three (0.08%) were synonymous, forty-seven (0.2%) were found at 3\u2032UTR, and the remaining 120 (0.22%) were found as 5\u2032UTR, upstream and downstream variants, frame shift variant, and also unknown variants. \n\nOne hundred and fifty-three SNPs were considered deleterious according to SIFT with score less than 0.05; the effects of the structural alteration were supported by PolyPhen in only two of them. All amino acid substitutions of these nsSNPs reduced the stability of Parkin protein as predicted by I-mutant 2.0 tool,  . \n\nThe 3D structure of Parkin protein was modeled and visualized using Chimera 1.8 software,  . \n\nTwenty-one SNPs were found to affect transcription factor binding activity (predicted by Regulomedb database) as in  . \n\nOne hundred and eighty-five SNPs were found to be exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), exonic splicing silencer (ESS), or abolishing domains as listed below. \n\n PINK1  . One thousand four hundred and seventy-six SNPs were retrieved from dbSNP of which thirty-three SNPs were found deleterious according to SIFT with damaging scores of less than 0.05 of which one matching SNP was found to have structural level of alteration in PolyPhen. Amino acid substitution of this nsSNP reduced the stability of the protein as predicted by I-mutant 2.0 tool,  . \n\nThe 3D structure of PINK1 protein was modeled and visualized using Chimera 1.8 software,  . \n\nForty-seven variants were found to affect transcription factor binding activity (predicted by Regulomedb database) as in Table 4 (see Supplementary Material available online at  ). \n\nNo intronic SNPs were found to affect the splicing site. \n\nTen SNPs were found to affect the microRNA binding site using SNP Function Prediction website: rs10493377, rs11543262, rs12093960, rs1801792, rs41296144, rs41301082, rs41311152, rs9436293, rs9436732, and rs9436733. \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nAnalysis of in silico single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has become a very valuable tool recently in order to predict variants most likely associated with disease which facilitates future association studies. This approach has been done for many disorders especially for cancer related genes [ \u2013 ]. In an effort to elucidate the identity of the pathogenic SNPs implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic Parkinson's disease, we performed an in silico analysis of candidate SNPs in   PARK2   and   PINK1   gene and analyzed twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four SNPs in   PARK2   and one thousand four hundred and seventy-six SNPs in   PINK1  . In this study, two variants were predicted to be damaging in   PARK2  ; the first (rs55961220) is A to C missense mutation which caused amino acid substitution C289G and the second (rs56092260) is G to A missense mutation that alters the amino acid R366W. Cysteine is sulfur containing hydrophilic amino acid while glycine is nonpolar hydrophobic one. Also arginine is a basic, hydrophobic amino acid containing amino group while tryptophan is nonpolar hydrophobic, ring containing amino acid. The later mutation was detected in two previous studies associated with a sporadic case of Parkinson's and the other with Juvenile Parkinson's disease. [ \u2013 ] \n\nOne hundred eighty-five alternative splice variants were revealed, which is much more that what was found by Scuderi et al. in 2014 who described 21 unique   PARK2   alternative splice variants through 26 different exon combinations [ ]. Despite that majority of SNPs in PARK2 gene are intronic, few are lying at exon/intron junctions and hence may cause splicing dysfunction. \n\nOn the other hand, one variant was found to be damaging in   PINK1  : a missense C to T mutation which alters the amino acid substitution P305L. Proline is an amino acid with a nonpolar ring usually responsible for the articulation within a protein while leucine in is a nonpolar aliphatic one. This variant is not currently associated with any human disease up to date. Interestingly, although a 23\u2009bp deletion of splicing regulation of exon 7 was found [ ], no apparent variants with splicing regulation were found in our study. These results suggest that common variations in PINK1 protein between individuals are rather quantitative which correlates with the spectrum of phenotypes seen in Parkinson's disease. \n\nIn brain samples of PD patients, miR-34b and miR-34c are significantly downregulated (almost by half) in the early stages of the disease [ ] especially in the amygdala, substantia nigra, and cerebral cortex. On the other hand, deficiency of the same miRNAs results in apoptosis of differentiated neuroblastoma cells [ ]. In our study variants that upregulate or downregulate the miRNA binding site in both genes might consequently alter the function of their respective proteins leading to the development of PD, a promising area to be further investigated for better understanding of its pathogenicity. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nIn silico analysis of SNPs in genes known to be associated with PD is a great aid for future candidate gene studies. All of these mutations constitute possible candidates for further genetic epidemiological studies with a special consideration of the large heterogeneity of PD among the different populations. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5227114, "text_md5": "94c1da12d93d2cdb80074bb6bc5ff86b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 142], "journal": [143, 161], "publication_year": [163, 167], "title": [178, 290], "keywords": [304, 304], "abstract": [317, 1644], "body": [1653, 13545]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 28127307, "doi": "10.1155/2016/9313746", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227114", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5227114"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227114\">5227114</a>", "list_title": "PMC5227114  In Silico Analysis of SNPs in PARK2 and PINK1 Genes That Potentially Cause Autosomal Recessive Parkinson Disease"}

However, even when nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss is severe enough to cause motor symptoms, many patients remain cognitively unimpaired. It is unclear what brain mechanisms allow these patients to remain cognitively unimpaired despite substantial dopamine dysregulation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThirty\u2010one cognitively unimpaired PD participants off dopaminergic medications were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a working memory task, along with 23 controls. We first compared the PD off medication (PD_OFF) group with controls to determine whether PD participants engage compensatory frontostriatal mechanisms during working memory. We then studied the same PD participants on dopaminergic medications to determine whether these compensatory brain changes are altered with dopamine. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nControls and PD showed working memory load\u2010dependent activation in the bilateral putamen, anterior\u2013dorsal insula, supplementary motor area, and anterior cingulate cortex. Compared to controls, PD_OFF showed compensatory hyperactivation of bilateral putamen and posterior insula, and machine learning algorithms identified robust differences in putamen activation patterns. Compared to PD_OFF, the PD on medication group showed reduced compensatory activation in the putamen. Loss of compensatory hyperactivation on dopaminergic medication correlated with slower performance on the working memory task and slower cognitive speed on the Symbol Digit Modality Test. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nOur results provide novel evidence that PD patients maintain normal cognitive performance through compensatory hyperactivation of the putamen. Dopaminergic medication downregulates this hyperactivation, and the degree of downregulation predicts behavior. Identifying cognitive compensatory mechanisms in PD is important for understanding how some patients maintain intact cognitive performance despite nigrostriatal dopamine loss. ANN NEUROL 2016;79:448\u2013463 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nAt the time of diagnosis, approximately 60 to 85% of Parkinson disease (PD) patients are considered cognitively unimpaired. ,  ,  ,   Within 3 years, a third of these patients progress to mild cognitive impairment ,  ; however, the neural processes that distinguish cognitively unimpaired and impaired patients are poorly understood.  Studies investigating early PD neuropathology suggest that mild cognitive impairment results from neurotransmitter dysregulation and, in particular, from downstream effects of nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss.  What brain mechanisms allow some patients to have preserved cognitive performance when dopamine neuron loss is sufficient to manifest motor symptoms?  One hypothesis is that compensatory neuronal activity is present in regions affected by early dopamine neuron loss.  Characterizing potential compensatory mechanisms is paramount for understanding, and ultimately treating, PD cognitive impairments. In particular, this could lead to identification of potential therapeutic targets for improving cognitive performance in impaired individuals. \n\nWorking memory, the ability to maintain and manipulate information in temporary storage for task\u2010relevant goals, is central to many higher\u2010order cognitive functions, ,   and working memory deficits are often the earliest cognitive sequelae in PD patients.  Dopamine is critical for normal working memory, ,   and administration of dopamine\u2010receptor blocking medications to normal adults leads to deficits in working memory ability.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of healthy individuals has identified a frontostriatal network, involving the caudate, putamen, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), that is activated during a wide range of working memory tasks. ,  ,  ,   Several fMRI studies in PD have identified frontostriatal modulation associated with impairments in cognitive performance,  including reduced striatal activity during working memory and other executive tasks. ,  ,  ,   Striatal under\u2010recruitment has been implicated as a possible mechanism for PD\u2010related executive dysfunction. ,   However, few studies have investigated frontostriatal activity in cognitively unimpaired patients. In particular, it remains unclear whether these patients engage the putamen and caudate more to achieve similar levels of performance as controls. ,   It is also not known whether cortical hubs within cognitive control networks, such as the PFC or the insula, are differently engaged in cognitively unimpaired patients. ,   Crucially, little is known about the influence of dopaminergic medication on the striatum and extrastriatal cognitive networks and the subsequent impact on cognitive processing in PD. The stringent off\u2013on medication design traditionally used in PD motor studies is rarely applied to cognitive studies. \n\nHere we use fMRI to determine whether cognitively unimpaired PD patients engage compensatory frontostriatal activation during a working memory paradigm. To test this hypothesis, we compared PD subjects off dopaminergic medications (PD_OFF) with cognitively matched healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we used a stringent off\u2013on design in these same patients to investigate how dopaminergic medications alter performance and brain activation. We hypothesized that unimpaired cognitive performance in PD patients when off dopaminergic medications would be associated with compensatory hyperactivation in frontostriatal regions and, critically, that activation in these regions would be modulated when patients are on dopaminergic medications, suggesting a mechanism for dopamine\u2010mediated alterations in working memory function. Finally, we used multivariate classification analysis to determine brain regions where activation patterns during working memory can most accurately differentiate between groups. \n\n## Subjects and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nOur sample included a total of 54 right\u2010handed participants with normal or corrected\u2010to\u2010normal vision. Participants were recruited from the Stanford Movement Disorders Clinic and from the surrounding community. Participants included 31 PD patients with no cognitive impairment, defined as no more than 1 test exceeding 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below age\u2010 and education\u2010matched normative values on comprehensive neuropsychological testing that included at least 2 tests for each of the 5 cognitive domains  (Table  ). All patients were diagnosed with PD by a board\u2010certified neurologist with specialty training in movement disorders (K.L.P.) based on UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria.  For further confirmation of diagnostic accuracy, we only included participants with at least 2 years of a PD diagnosis and at least 20% improvement on the Movement Disorders Society\u2010United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (MDS\u2010UPDRS\u2010III)  when on dopaminergic medications. PD patients underwent a comprehensive neurological screening examination and the MDS\u2010UPDRS\u2010III both off and on dopaminergic medications. As recommended by current criteria,  the comprehensive neuropsychological testing was performed on medications to minimize motoric interference in testing. The \u201cpractical\u201d off state for both clinical and imaging assessments was defined as \u226572 hours off extended release dopamine agonists, selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and long\u2010acting L\u2010dopa, and \u226512 hours off short\u2010acting dopamine agonists and L\u2010dopa. The practical on state for both clinical and imaging assessments was defined as the patients taking their normal daily medications in the optimally medicated state, as determined by both the patient and the movement disorders neurologist. Seven PD patients were excluded from analysis: 2 due to technical failure of input device during scan acquisition, 3 due to excessive head movement (see fMRI Preprocessing below), 1 due to identification of unknown metal in the skin during scanner localization, and 1 due to subject illness precluding completion of the study. Therefore, 24 PD patients were included in the final data analysis. With regard to dopamine replacement therapy, 3 participants were taking only a dopamine agonist, 11 were taking only L\u2010dopa, and 10 were taking a combination of an agonist and L\u2010dopa. In addition, we recruited 23 age\u2010 and education\u2010matched HC. Inclusion criteria for all PD and HC participants were as follows: (1) age between 45 and 90 years; (2) fluency in English; (3) no contraindications to fMRI scanning; (4) no history of significant neurological disease (other than PD), serious psychiatric illness, or substance abuse; and (5) no history of cognitive impairment during phone screening. In addition, all control participants were evaluated as healthy in a neurological screening examination, and obtained a score on the Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) \u2265 27. A subgroup of HC participants were administered the entire neuropsychological battery (see Table  ). \n  \nDemographic and Neuropsychological Data \n    \nPD participants completed 2 fMRI sessions; 1 in the off medication state (PD_OFF) and 1 in the on medication state (PD_ON). Sessions were counterbalanced and conducted at least 2 weeks apart. The HC participants completed 1 fMRI session. The Stanford University Institutional Review Board approved all study protocols. All study participants provided written consent. \n\n\n### Brain Imaging \n  \n#### Experimental Procedures \n  \nParticipants performed a modified Sternberg working memory task  during the fMRI experiment. Each trial consisted of either a high\u2010load or a low\u2010load working memory condition (Fig  ). Task accuracy and reaction time (RT) were recorded for each trial. Each scan included 4 task runs, which each consisted of 7 high\u2010load and 7 low\u2010load working memory trials randomly intermixed. Each run began with a 10\u2010second rest interval to allow the fMRI signals to equilibrate. The stimulus presentations were implemented using E\u2010Prime software (v2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA; 2002) and projected at the center of the screen using a magnet\u2010compatible projection system. Prior to each fMRI session, participants were trained with instructions and a practice session of the task. \n  \nSchematic of the high\u2010load and low\u2010load Sternberg working memory paradigm. Following a 0.5\u2010second fixation, participants were presented 5 numbers (0\u20139) simultaneously during a 2\u2010second encoding phase. Encoding was followed by a jittered maintenance phase (6 \u00b1 2 seconds) during which a fixation marker was displayed. Then a probe (ie, a single number) was displayed for 0.5 seconds, prompting participants to use the button box in their right hand to indicate whether the probe matched any number presented during the encoding phase. In the high\u2010load condition the participants were presented with 5 distinct numbers; in the low\u2010load condition the 5 numbers were identical. \n  \n\n#### Functional MRI Acquisition \n  \nImages were acquired on a Discovery MR750 3.0T scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI) using a custom\u2010built head coil at the Stanford University Lucas Center. Head movement was minimized during the scan by placing weighted bags over the limbs to dampen the presence of tremor and by securing the head using customized padding. A total of 29 axial slices (4.0mm thickness, 0.5mm skip), parallel to the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure line and covering the whole brain, were imaged using a T2*\u2010weighted gradient\u2010echo spiral in\u2013out pulse sequence  with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2 seconds, echo time (TE) = 30 milliseconds, flip angle = 80\u00b0. The field of view was 20cm, and the matrix size was 64 \u00d7 64, providing an in\u2010plane spatial resolution of 3.125mm. To reduce blurring and signal loss from field inhomogeneity, an automated high\u2010order shimming method based on spiral acquisitions was used before acquiring fMRI scans. \n\n\n#### Structural MRI Acquisition \n  \nFor each subject, a high\u2010resolution T1\u2010weighted spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state inversion recovery 3\u2010dimensional (3D) MRI sequence was acquired to facilitate anatomical localization in functional scans. The following parameters were used: inversion time = 300 milliseconds; TR = 8.4 milliseconds; TE = 1.8 milliseconds; flip angle = 15\u00b0; 22cm field of view; 132 slices in coronal plane; 256 \u00d7 192 matrix; number of excitations = 2; acquired resolution = 1.5 \u00d7 0.9 \u00d7 1.1mm. \n\n\n#### fMRI Preprocessing \n  \nfMRI data were analyzed using SPM8 ( ). The first 5 volumes were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration. A linear shim correction was applied separately for each slice during reconstruction.  Images were first realigned to the first scan to correct for motion and slice acquisition timing. Translational movement (x, y, z) was calculated in millimeters based on the SPM8 parameters for motion correction of the functional images in each subject. To correct for deviant volumes resulting from spikes in movement, we used despiking procedures similar to those implemented in the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) toolkit maintained by the National Institute of Mental Health (Bethesda, MD). Volumes with movement exceeding 0.5 voxels (1.562mm) or spikes in global signal exceeding 5% were interpolated using the 2 adjacent volumes. In all groups, the majority of repaired volumes occurred in isolation. Three PD participants were excluded due to head movement parameters exceeding 2mm. In the remaining scans, no participant had more than a maximum scan\u2010to\u2010scan movement of 2mm or >2% of volumes corrected. Crucially, movement parameters did not differ between the groups in any direction of translation or rotation (Table  ). After the interpolation procedure, images were spatially transformed for registration to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, resampled to 2mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed with a 6mm full\u2010width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Coregistration quality was checked manually during the registration procedure. In addition, the Dice Similarity Coefficients between the mean functional image and the coregistered skull stripped structural image, and between fully preprocessed functional images and the MNI 152 template, were calculated. The coefficients reflect good registration quality with small variations across all subjects (Table  ). \n  \nTranslational and Rotational Movement Parameters for HC, PD_OFF, and PD_ON Groups \n      \nDSCs of Coreg and Norm for HC, PD_OFF, and PD_ON Groups \n    \n\n#### Individual Subject and Group Analysis \n  \nTask\u2010related brain activation was identified using the general linear model implemented in SPM8. In the individual subject analyses, interpolated volumes flagged at the preprocessing stage were deweighted. The primary goal of this analysis was to examine group differences in activation related to working memory load. Brain activation related to the 2 task conditions (high\u2010load and low\u2010load) were first modeled at the individual subject level using boxcar functions corresponding to the block length (onset of the encoding phase to 1,000 milliseconds after the onset of the probe) and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and a temporal dispersion derivative to account for voxelwise latency differences in hemodynamic response. Low\u2010frequency noise was removed with a high\u2010pass filter (0.5 cycle/min) applied to the fMRI time series at each voxel. Voxelwise   t   statistic maps contrasting high\u2010load and low\u2010load were generated for each participant. \n\nFor group analysis, contrast images corresponding to the high\u2010load and low\u2010load tasks were analyzed using a random effects analysis. Group\u2010level analyses were first conducted using a 1\u2010way   t   test on pooled data from HC and PD_OFF (n = 47) to identify areas of significant load\u2010dependent activation (high\u2010load minus low\u2010load). Next, 2 between\u2010group analyses were conducted: (1) 2\u2010sample   t   tests were used to compare load\u2010dependent activation between HC and PD_OFF, and (2) paired\u2010sample   t   tests were used to compare load\u2010dependent activation between PD_OFF and PD_ON. For all analyses, significant clusters of activation were identified at the whole\u2010brain level using a height threshold of   p   < 0.001, with familywise error (FWE) correction for multiple spatial comparisons at   p   < 0.01, determined using Monte Carlo simulations implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using methods similar to AFNI's AlphaSim program. Specifically, 10,000 iterations of random 3D images with the same resolution and dimensions as the fMRI data were generated. The resulting images were masked for the whole brain and then smoothed with the same 6mm full\u2010width half\u2010maximum Gaussian kernel used to smooth the fMRI data. The maximum cluster size was computed for each iteration, and the probability distribution was estimated across the 10,000 iterations. The cluster threshold corresponding to an FWE significance level of height   p   < 0.001 and cluster extent   p   < 0.01 was determined to be 42 voxels. \n\n\n#### Behavioral Correlation Analysis \n  \nThe above analysis focused on PD\u2010 and dopamine\u2010related alterations in brain recruitment associated with load\u2010dependent working memory. We conducted additional analyses to examine the functional ramifications of altered patterns of neural activity. We identified cortical and subcortical regions within the frontostriatal and salience networks that showed peak load\u2010dependent brain activation, and we extracted spheres around the center of activation using the MarsBaR toolbox. To investigate the possible functional role of these regions, we correlated load\u2010dependent activation with the behavioral measure of RT (collected during the task in the scanner). In the PD group, we additionally correlated activation with working memory and executive performance during neuropsychological testing on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), oral administration; Trail Making Test; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV, digit span subtest; phonemic and semantic verbal fluency measures (controlled oral word fluency to the letters F\u2010A\u2010S [FAS] and animal naming, respectively); and Stroop. \n\n\n\n### Classification and Cross\u2010Validation \n  \nTo further validate the sensitivity of the selected regions, we examined whether activation patterns in the most contrasted regions could differentiate between PD and HC participants.  A linear support vector machine algorithm from an open\u2010source library, LIBSVM (Library for Support Vector Machines [SVM];  ), was used for the multivariate classification analysis. First, images from each individual were masked by a binary mask with 8 spherical regions from cortical and subcortical regions that showed load\u2010dependent brain activation within the frontostriatal and salience networks. The centers of these regions were defined by the peak voxels detected in fMRI group analysis. We trained the SVM classifier with all the masked contrast images, so that it can predict whether an image is from an HC or PD_OFF participant. Second, the performance of classification was evaluated using a leave\u20101\u2010subject\u2010out cross\u2010validation procedure. In this procedure, the image from 1 subject was selected as a test set. The rest of the data were used to train a classifier, which was then applied to predict the group of the test set. This procedure was repeated 46 times, with each subject's data tested once. The average prediction accuracy across all test sets was termed as the cross\u2010validation accuracy. To justify the statistical significance of this accuracy, \u00d75,000 random permutation was used, where data labels of HC and PD_OFF were randomly switched in each permutation. Finally, the contribution of each region was also studied individually. Higher cross\u2010validation accuracy indicates stronger differentiating power of the individual region. We repeated for PD_ON versus HC. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nPD and HC participant groups were matched for age, education, and MMSE score; however, the PD group had more male participants than the HC group (see Table  ). A mixed measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with between\u2010subject factor Group (HC, PD_OFF) and within\u2010subject factor Load (high\u2010load, low\u2010load) was used to analyze the differences in RT (Fig  A). The main effect of Load was significant (  F   = 92.935,   p   < 0.001), with slower RT on high\u2010load compared to low\u2010load in both groups. The main effect of Group was not significant (  F   = 0.009,   p   = 0.925), and the interaction between Group and Load was not significant (  F   = 2.478,   p   = 0.123). A similar analysis was used to determine the differences in accuracy as the independent variable. The main effect of Load was not significant (  F   = 0.5138,   p   = 0.48), but the main effect of Group was significant (  F   = 6.183,   p   = 0.015). The interaction between Group and Load was significant (  F   = 4.945,   p   = 0.031); post hoc   t   tests revealed that this was driven by PD_OFF being significantly less accurate than HC on the high\u2010load but not the low\u2010load condition (  p   < 0.05). \n  \nBehavioral performance in healthy controls (HC) and Parkinson disease (PD) patients. (A) HC were more accurate than PD patients off dopaminergic medications in the high\u2010load but not the low\u2010load condition. Reaction time was not different between groups in either condition. (B) PD patients had similar accuracy while they were off and on dopaminergic medications; however, reaction time was slower in the on state for both high\u2010load and low\u2010load. *  p   < 0.05. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at  .] \n  \nA repeated measures ANOVA with within\u2010subject factor Group (PD_OFF, PD_ON) and within\u2010subject factor Load (high\u2010load, low\u2010load) was used to analyze the differences in RT (see Fig  B). The main effect of Group was significant (  F   = 11.063,   p   = 0.003), with slower RT in the PD_ON compared to PD_OFF group, and the main effect of Load was significant (  F   = 35.060,   p   < 0.001), with slower RT on high\u2010load compared to low\u2010load. The interaction between Group and Load was not significant (  F   = 0.888,   p   = 0.356). A similar analysis was used to determine the differences in accuracy as the independent variable. The main effect of Group was not significant (  F   = 1.716,   p   = 0.203), but the main effect of Load was significant (  F   = 5.076,   p   = 0.034), with better accuracy in the low\u2010load compared to the high\u2010load condition. The interaction between Group and Load was not significant (  F   = 0.001,   p   = 0.977). \n\n\n### Brain Activation during Working Memory Task \n  \nWe examined the overall pattern of load\u2010dependent (high\u2010load greater than low\u2010load) brain activation by pooling data from the PD_OFF and HC participants during the working memory task. We found significant load\u2010dependent activation of the bilateral putamen, bilateral anterior\u2013dorsal insula, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), pre\u2010SMA, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral PFC, and bilateral cerebellum (Fig  ). See Table   for all peak regions of activation. \n  \nCoordinates of Peak Load\u2010Dependent Activations in MNI Space \n      \nLoad\u2010dependent working memory effects on combined data from healthy controls and Parkinson disease patients off dopaminergic medications.

PD patients off dopaminergic medications showed greater load\u2010dependent activation than the HC group in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, including the bilateral putamen, bilateral posterior insula, right SMA, left inferior parietal lobule, and left thalamus (Figs   and  ). There was no increased activation in the HC group compared to the PD_OFF group at either   p   < 0.001 or   p   < 0.01, FWE\u2010corrected thresholds. \n  \nGroup differences in working memory load\u2010dependent activation. (A) Brain areas that showed greater activation in Parkinson disease (PD) patients off dopaminergic medications compared to healthy controls (HC). No brain areas showed reduced activation in PD patients off dopaminergic medications compared to HC. (B) Brain areas that showed greater activation in PD patients off compared to on dopaminergic medications. No brain areas showed reduced activation in PD patients off compared to on dopaminergic medications. Slices show significant load\u2010dependent activation (high\u2010load minus low\u2010load) in hot colors (  p   < 0.001, corrected).

[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at  .] \n  \n\n### Differences in Brain Activation Associated with Dopaminergic Medications \n  \nWe then investigated the basis of poorer (slower) RT in PD patients on dopaminergic medications by comparing fMRI brain activity in the PD patients while off versus on medications. PD_OFF showed greater load\u2010dependent activation in the bilateral putamen, bilateral caudate, left dorsolateral PFC, left hippocampus, and left SMA than PD_ON (see Fig  ). There was no increased activation in the PD_ON than PD_OFF group at either   p   < 0.001 or   p   < 0.01, FWE\u2010corrected thresholds. \n\n\n### Brain\u2013Behavior Associations in PD \n  \nWe further investigated brain\u2013behavior associations with PD working memory by evaluating whether individual differences in activation were associated with cognitive performance in PD patients. To examine this, we created regions of interest around activation peaks identified in the contrasts: high\u2010load minus low\u2010load in PD_OFF relative to HC and high\u2010load minus low\u2010load in PD_OFF relative to PD_ON (bilateral posterior putamen, bilateral posterior insula, left dorsolateral PFC, and left hippocampus). Finally, to examine the role of anterior\u2013dorsal insula activation on working memory RT, we created regions around right and left insula activation peaks identified in the contrast of high\u2010load minus low\u2010load in the combined subject analysis, for a total of 8 regions in the analysis. \n\nSee Table   for RT correlations with all 8 activation peaks. In the PD_ON group, activation in the bilateral posterior putamen and the right posterior insula negatively correlated with high\u2010load RT (ie, longer RT with less activation; Fig  ). In addition, less PD_ON activation in the bilateral posterior putamen correlated with slower responses on the SDMT (right putamen:   r   = 0.398,   p   = 0.05; left putamen,   r   = 0.478,   p   = 0.02), suggesting that dopamine suppresses recruitment of putamen activity and this suppression results in slower cognitive speed. High\u2010load RT in HC correlated with activation in the left anterior\u2013dorsal insula, but not the right anterior\u2013dorsal insula. There was no relationship between anterior\u2013dorsal insula activity and RT in either the PD_OFF or the PD_ON group. However, in PD_OFF increased left anterior\u2013dorsal insula activity was associated with worse performance on the FAS word fluency test (  r   = \u22120.48,   p   = 0.02). Finally, there was no relationship between regional activation and measures of PD disease severity (MDS\u2010UPDRS\u2010III or disease duration). \n  \nCorrelation between High\u2010Load Reaction Time and Load\u2010Dependent Percentage Signal Change in Cortical and Subcortical Regions of Interest That Show Load\u2010Dependent Alterations in Activation \n      \nBrain\u2013behavior relations. Bilateral putamen regions were identified from between\u2010group peak activation differences shown in Figure  B. Load\u2010dependent activation levels (beta estimates) were extracted from these regions to determine the relationship between load\u2010dependent activation and clinical cognitive measures of performance. The y\u2010axis shows beta estimates in the Parkinson disease (PD) patients on dopaminergic medication, where lower compensatory putamen activation was associated with (A, B) slower high\u2010load reaction time during the working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging task, and (C, D) slower performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). In PD patients on dopamine medications, there was a similar relationship between lower right posterior insula activation and slower high\u2010load reaction time (  r   = \u22120.412,   p   = 0.045, not shown) \n  \n\n### Activation\u2010Based Classification between PD and HC \n  \nFinally, we validated the sensitivity of load\u2010dependent activation patterns by classification using an SVM machine learning algorithm. The 8 regions with the largest contrasts, including bilateral putamen, left dorsolateral PFC, left hippocampus, bilateral posterior insula, and bilateral anterior\u2013dorsal insula, were combined into a mask to extract the image data for algorithm training to differentiate between PD_OFF and HC participants. A significant 78.26% cross\u2010validation accuracy (  p   = 0.019) was achieved by the trained classifier (Fig  ). When determining the contribution of each region to the classification, training data from 3 regions achieved significant classifier accuracy: 76.1% accuracy from the right putamen (  p   = 0.006), 73.9% from the left putamen (  p   = 0.04), and 71.74% from the left anterior\u2013dorsal insula (  p   = 0.03). This result provides robust evidence for aberrant functional organization of the putamen and insula in PD patients when off dopaminergic medications. The same mask applied to differentiate between PD_ON and HC participants achieved 68.75% accuracy, but was not significant (  p   = 0.358). \n  \nClassification accuracy for discriminating Parkinson disease patients from healthy controls. Results are based on data from 8 unbiased regions of interest (ROIs) that showed working memory load\u2010dependent activation in a combined group of patients and controls. Separate analyses were performed for all 8 ROIs taken together, as well as each ROI individually. *  p   < 0.05 in random permutation test. AIC = anterior\u2013dorsal insula; DLPFC = left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; HPC = hippocampus; L = left; PIC = posterior insula; PUT = putamen; R = right. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at  .] \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe demonstrate that intact working memory in cognitively unimpaired PD is associated with increased activation within the bilateral putamen and bilateral posterior insula. Critically, dopaminergic medications reduced putamen hyperactivation, and individual differences in loss of compensatory hyperactivation were associated with slower cognitive speed. Our findings establish a novel framework for understanding cognitive function in PD patients, in both the dopamine depleted (off) and replenished (on) states, and identify a compensatory frontostriatal network in cognitively unimpaired PD. \n\n### Compensatory Putamen Activity in PD Working Memory \n  \nSubstantia nigra dopamine neuron loss with resulting reduction in dopaminergic input to the striatum is the neurobiological basis for the cardinal motor symptoms in PD. More recently, this loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic input has been suggested as a mechanism for PD cognitive symptoms, including executive and working memory dysfunction.  This is in line with studies that identify the striatum as a central node for working memory in healthy individuals, and numerous fMRI studies have demonstrated both caudate and putamen activation during various working memory tasks. ,  ,  ,  ,   In cognitively impaired PD, striatal under\u2010recruitment has been suggested as an etiology for executive dysfunction. ,  ,  ,  ,   However, there have been conflicting findings regarding activation changes in cognitively unimpaired patients, in part due to variable definitions of PD cognitive impairment prior to the current operationalized definition.  Some studies report that cognitively unimpaired PD subjects show similar striatal activation to a healthy cohort, ,   whereas others suggest increases in task\u2010related striatal activation. ,  ,   Our findings demonstrate load\u2010dependent putamen hyperactivation during working memory in cognitively unimpaired PD compared to well\u2010matched healthy adults. Crucially, multivariate classification analysis using cross\u2010validation procedures revealed that putamen activity alone provided >75% accuracy in distinguishing between PD_OFF and HC, providing additional evidence for the putamen as a key locus of differences between PD and HC. Although we cannot completely rule out the influence of noncognitive aspects of PD pathophysiology on these finding, it is important to note that increased putamen activation did not correlate with any measures of PD motor dysfunction (MDS\u2010UPDRS) or general disease severity (duration). Thus, our findings identify a robust striatal mechanism in cognitively unimpaired PD that compensates for loss of nigrostriatal dopamine. We propose that the observed putamen hyperactivation is compensatory and hypothesize that in cognitively impaired patients losing this compensatory activation contributes to poor performance. Increased putamen activity during a cognitively demanding task could be an objective imaging biomarker for interventions aimed at improving cognitive performance in PD. Further studies are needed to test these hypotheses, ideally in longitudinal patients as they develop cognitive impairment. \n\nIt is interesting that the putamen was the peak activation nuclei in the basal ganglia during our working memory task, with less activation in the caudate. Animal studies initially suggested that structural subregions of the basal ganglia connect to specific cortical regions and associated cognitive functions, with the caudate and nucleus accumbens primarily involved with goal\u2010directed learning. Human studies with fMRI, however, have revealed a more complex relationship between basal ganglia subregions and cognitive functioning. A recent meta\u2010analysis of working memory fMRI tasks showed activation peaks in caudate, putamen, and pallidal nuclei for the main effect of task,  and multiple studies have identified strong putamen activation during working memory, particularly during the encoding phase,  with more caudate involvement during memory manipulation during the maintenance phase.  One study found that the putamen is engaged in preparing to filter out irrelevant information during memory encoding, and that putamen and pallidal activation correlated with working memory capacity.  Our study adds to this growing literature on the role of the putamen in successful working memory in PD. \n\n\n### Dopaminergic Modulation of Compensatory Putamen Activity \n  \nThe contribution of dopamine to working memory has been extensively explored in biological,  computational,  and psychological  models. In clinical studies, the gold standard for investigating the contribution of dopamine to PD motor symptoms is the off\u2013on medication testing paradigm; however, few cognitive fMRI studies have employed this rigorous approach.  Our structured off\u2013on design allowed us to address an important question: how does dopaminergic medication affect brain responses in cognitively unimpaired PD and alter the observed compensatory hyperactivation? We found that dopaminergic replacement resulted in slower cognitive reaction time during the Sternberg task, and that individual differences in such slowing correlated with loss of compensatory hyperactivation in the putamen in PD. Our findings also suggest a speed\u2013accuracy tradeoff, such that patients sacrifice speed to maintain accuracy with dopamine replacement. We argue that RT during our task was a measure of cognitive speed and not motor speed, as the PD patients on medications had faster motor speed on the MDS\u2010UPDRS\u2010III (off = 33.4 \u00b1 11.9, on = 18.2 \u00b1 11.0,   p   < 0.0001), but slower RT during the task. Prior behavioral studies showing L\u2010dopa\u2013associated cognitive slowing during a Sternberg working memory task support our findings.  We also found a similar relationship between dopaminergic\u2010associated loss of compensatory putamen hyperactivation and slower cognitive performance on the SDMT, a commonly used measure of working memory and executive functioning. Of note, the SDMT is the recommended test for identifying slowed information\u2010processing speed in patients with multiple sclerosis.  Critically, we administered the oral version of the SDMT to minimize potential bias from bradykinesia. However, it is important to note that cognitive slowing in the PD patients on dopamine might not be specific to working memory and could reflect other cognitive aspects of the task, such as attention or distractibility. Further studies are needed to further understand the influences of dopamine on these complex features of executive function in PD. \n\nThis study adds valuable information to the growing literature on the cognitive and psychiatric effects of dopamine replacement therapy in PD patients.  In many patients, it can be difficult to find the appropriate balance between giving enough dopamine to adequately treat motor symptoms while also minimizing nonmotor side effects. The 2014 PQRS Measures Group for Parkinson's disease recommended all PD patients have an annual clinical assessment of cognitive function, but does not mention specific tests to administer. Our data suggest the SDMT could be a good test for physician use to regularly monitor the dopaminergic effects on PD working memory, particularly in otherwise cognitively unimpaired patients. \n\n\n### Cortical Activity in PD during Working Memory \n  \nIn addition to the striatum, working memory is mediated by distributed cortical brain regions, and specifically regions with a large number of striatocortical dopaminergic projections such as the PFC. In 1979, Brozoski et al first demonstrated that dopamine depletion in the PFC in monkeys leads to severe deficits during a delayed response task.  More recent studies suggest that the relationship between PFC dopamine and working memory function is highly complex and best represented by an inverted U\u2010shaped curve where both too little and too much dopamine impairs performance. ,  ,   Importantly, a single U\u2010shaped curve is insufficient to describe this relationship, and variables such as baseline cognitive performance and task difficulty influence the effect of dopamine on working memory function. A few fMRI studies have examined this relationship in PD patients specifically. Lewis et al found altered PFC activity in cognitively impaired compared to cognitively unimpaired PD patients on dopamine and concluded that impaired working memory accuracy is associated with reduced PFC activation in medicated patients.  Using our structured off\u2013on design, we found similar loss of dorsolateral PFC activation in cognitively unimpaired PD patients on compared to off dopamine, which supports the inverted U\u2010curve hypothesis and suggests that dopamine impairs PFC neuronal activity in patients with otherwise normal cognitive performance off medications. We did not, however, find a relationship between PFC activation and task accuracy, likely due to the simplicity of our task. Our task design was not optimized to investigate activation\u2010related changes in accuracy, because all 3 groups had >92% accuracy, with a substantial ceiling effect. It is possible that dopamine\u2010mediated loss of PFC activation would predict performance in cognitively unimpaired patients during a more challenging working memory task. ,  ,  \n\n\n### The Insula in PD Working Memory \n  \nAlthough the PFC has been the cortical focus for most fMRI working memory studies, recent evidence suggests that the insula is also a critical cortical node in the modulation of cognition and working memory.  A recent fMRI meta\u2010analysis showed that the anterior\u2013dorsal, anterior\u2013ventral, and posterior subregions of the insula are tightly linked to distinct cognitive, affective, and somatosensory functions, respectively.  Our data are the first to provide evidence of this functional organization in PD. The anterior\u2013dorsal insula plays a critical role in the detection of novel salient stimuli and facilitates bottom\u2010up access to attentional and working memory resources.  In our study, all 3 groups showed load\u2010dependent increases in anterior\u2013dorsal insula activation, with similar activation between the PD and control participants (see Fig  ). We surprisingly found that activation of the anterior\u2013dorsal insula correlated with PD phonemic fluency during neuropsychological testing, but not RT during the task. In PD patients, poor phonemic fluency is common and can be an early sign of general executive dysfunction. We did not have neuropsychological testing on all of our control subjects to further explore whether the relationship between insula activation and phonemic fluency was PD specific, and further studies exploring insula activation in PD patients with executive dysfunction would help clarify the role of the insula during the Sternberg task. \n\nBy contrast, we found working memory load\u2010dependent hyperactivation of the posterior insular cortex in PD_OFF relative to controls. Similar to the striatum, loss of compensatory hyperactivation predicted slower RT in PD patients on dopaminergic medications. The posterior insula is thought to modulate planning movements and somatosensory execution of movements through projections to the posterior putamen.  There is an anatomic gradient between the insula and the basal ganglia, and the posterior insula specifically projects to the posterior putamen, which is the region of the putamen most affected in early PD.  One recent study found reduced dopamine receptor availability in the bilateral posterior insula, which was associated with poor executive task performance, suggesting that PD\u2010associated denervation from the putamen to the posterior insula modulates cognition impairment.  Further studies are needed to better delineate the complex role of the posterior insula in PD cognitive processes. \n\n\n### Methodology and Limitations \n  \nWe hypothesized that intact working memory in PD is associated with compensatory changes in brain activity, thus we recruited subjects based on cognitive performance alone rather than motor\u2010based categorizations, such as duration or Hoehn and Yahr stage. To increase the specificity for unimpaired cognition in our cohort, we employed a stricter cutoff of 1.5 SD on neuropsychological testing,  and we showed that our PD patients did not differ substantially from a representative subgroup of HC. Despite these strict criteria, our PD group had slightly worse performance during the more demanding high\u2010load working memory task. However, we only included accurate trials in the analysis; therefore, it is unlikely that these slight differences in accuracy account for our findings. One possible confound is that the PD patients were on a mixture of dopamine agonists and L\u2010dopa, which can differently modulate working memory and executive function in PD. ,   In our sample, 21 of 24 PD participants were on L\u2010dopa; therefore, our dopaminergic\u2010associated findings most likely represent the specific effect of L\u2010dopa on working memory. Finally, although we cannot completely discount coregistration errors in small subcortical structures, such as the putamen and neighboring white matter tracks, our quality assurance analysis showed good registration performance. \n\nOur study has several strengths, including comprehensive cognitive testing, a large sample size, and a structured off\u2013on testing paradigm. Furthermore, we were careful to minimize head motion during scans, and no differences in head motion were identified between groups. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, our study provides novel evidence that PD patients maintain intact cognitive performance through compensatory hyperactivation of the putamen. Furthermore, we found that dopamine\u2010mediated downregulation of putamen hyperactivation predicts behavior. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these identified changes can predict future conversion from normal cognition to PD cognitive impairment. \n\n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nConcept and design of the study: K.L.P., F.M.T., S.L., V.M.; data acquisition and analysis: K.L.P., S.Y., K.Z., W.C., D.E., F.M.T., S.L., V.M.; drafting of the manuscript and figures: K.L.P., K.Z., W.C., V.M. \n\n\n## Potential Conflicts of Interest \n  \nNothing to report. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4789131, "text_md5": "4c30956acdf0aaeb7b439c278dc75b81", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 161], "publication_year": [163, 167], "title": [178, 252], "keywords": [266, 266], "abstract": [279, 2395], "body": [2404, 45917]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26696272, "doi": "10.1002/ana.24585", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4789131", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4789131"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4789131\">4789131</a>", "list_title": "PMC4789131  Compensatory neural mechanisms in cognitively unimpaired Parkinson disease"}

A composite visual assessment from five independent nuclear imaging readers, together with striatal standard uptake value (SUV) to occipital SUV ratio, striatal gradients and putamen asymmetry-based semi-quantitative PET metrics automatically extracted used to train machine learning models to classify IPD versus controls. Using a ratio of 70/30 for training and testing sets, respectively, five classification models\u2014k-NN, LogRegression, support vector machine, random forest and gradient boosting\u2014were trained by using 100 times repeated nested cross-validation procedures.

Because dopaminergic loss starts years before symptoms, the related clinical hallmarks\u2014shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with coordination\u2014may be subtle at very early stages, delaying definitive clinical diagnosis [ \u2013 ]. Although clinical and research diagnostic criteria for Parkinson disease have been updated in 2015 [ \u2013 ], the diagnostic confidence of IPD is still massively based on clinical follow-up and response to levodopa therapy, the new movement disorder society clinical diagnostic criteria for IPD being judged not useful by the experts in real-life practice [ ]. Nuclear imaging has been shown a very useful complementary diagnostic tool [ ], especially in atypical cases or at early stages of the disease. Dopaminergic PET imaging has gained progressive interest in practice, due to higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition procedure, improved dosimetry and cost-effectiveness compared to dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [ ,  ]. As for DAT SPECT, visual assessment remains the most widely used interpretation method in practice [ ]. Although simple static PET semi-quantification showed similar performance compared to PET kinetic procedures [ ,  ], its diagnostic performance compared to visual assessment remains largely unexplored in  F-DOPA PET imaging of IPD. \n\nTaking advantage of emerging machine learning capabilities, the aim of this study was to robustly decipher the relevance of visual and semi-quantitative  F-DOPA interpretation methods for the diagnostic of IPD in PET/MRI. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Population \n  \nIn this monocentric controlled study, all consecutive patients addressed in our PET/MR imaging center for suspicion of Parkinsonism were screened from February 2018 to March 2020. From the initial database, 367 patients from 83 different doctors were retrieved. Fifteen neurologists out of the 25 ones who addressed at least four patients responded back. All the included patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: The clinical diagnosis was based on medical history, clinical symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor), symptoms evolution under dopaminergic agonist; 11\u00a0months of median clinical follow-up between  F-DOPA PET and the last consultation date was verified. Based on neurologists\u2019 expertise, the clinical follow-up separated our population into two groups: clinically confirmed Parkinsonian syndrome and non-Parkinsonian syndromes (essential tremor, neuroleptic side-effects, non-Parkinsonian gait disorders). The cases of Parkinsonism still judged atypical after full multidisciplinary diagnostic work-up (in-laboratory video polysomnography, orthostatic hypotension test, specialized consultation in memory, neuro-psychologic test, assessment for dysarthria or swallowing trouble) were excluded from our study. A general overview of the selection process is provided in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nFlowchart of the patient selection process. From 367 patients, 110 were finally retained, including 48 IPD and 62 controls \n  \n\n\n### F-DOPA PET/MRI protocol \n  \nAll the included patients underwent hybrid brain imaging on the same 3-T PET/MRI system (Signa PET/MRI, GE Healthcare). The imaging protocol fulfilled the international guidelines [ ], and all patients discontinued L-DOPA at least 12\u00a0h as recommended by manufacturers. A simultaneous single-bed PET/MRI acquisition of 10\u00a0min performed 1h30 after the intravenous injection of 1.5\u00a0MBq/kg of  F-DOPA. During the PET acquisition, standard brain MR pulse sequences were performed, in particular: a zero time echo (ZTE) pulse sequence for MRI-based attenuation correction (matrix size: 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128; flip angle: 5\u00b0; TE: 1.7\u00a0ms; TR: 4\u00a0ms; slice thickness: 2.78\u00a0mm) and a morphological 3D T1-weighted pulse sequence, BRAVO, matrix size: 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009226; flip angle: 15\u00b0; TE: 3.2\u00a0ms; TR: 8.5\u00a0ms; slice thickness: 1.2\u00a0mm). All the PET data were corrected from attenuation and reconstructed using an iterative algorithm, 3D TOF-OSEM, 8 iterations and 28 subsets with time of flight and point spread function modeling: matrix size 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u200989, voxel size, 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u20092.8\u00a0mm with a 3-mm Gaussian post-filtering. \n\n\n### Image processing, data extraction and preparation \n  \nAn overview of image processing and analysis is provided in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nImage processing and data extraction. The whole dataset was assessed both visually and automatically. For visual analysis (A), five independent readers blindly re assessed all the  F-DOPA PET data by using the international recommendation procedure guideline. An overall composite \u201cvisual\u201d interpretation based on the five readers results was generated for each  F-DOPA PET. For automated analysis (B), the  F-DOPA PET/MRI data were processed in a dedicated neuroimaging pipeline (Free surfer) to be standardized and labeled. For this purpose, each T1w MRI was normalized into the MNI space, and the transformation was applied to the corresponding  F-DOPA PET. Numerous metrics could be extracted automatically from the standardized PET data. Finally, a subset of targeted PET metrics was retained (C) based on their conceptual relevance and explored to identify potential high collinearity (D) \n  \n\nFor the PET visual analysis, five experts in nuclear hybrid imaging, whose experience ranged from 6 to 12\u00a0years, independently reviewed all the PET/MRI on the same imaging workstation (ADW, version 4.7), all blinded to the final clinical diagnosis. For this purpose and using the predefined international criteria for  F-DOPA PET imaging [ ] with the same color scale, each expert realigned the data along the anterior to posterior corpus callosum axis, scaled the PET images to the rostral part of the putamen and carefully analyzed the distribution and intensity of  F-DOPA uptake in the striatum (caudate and putamen) and background. For each case, the procedure was timed from the image opening to the end of the analysis process. Any asymmetry or decrease in uptake in the striate was considered pathological. A three-point scale normal (\u201c\u2212\u20091\u201d), undetermined (\u201c0\u201d), and pathological (\u201c1\u201d) was first used, and the median score of the five readers represented the intermediate composite analysis of their expertise. In another session, readers altogether reviewed undetermined median score (\u201c0\u201d) cases to reach a consensus, and results were consequently attributed to all five readers to obtain a final composite binary output: normal or pathological. The final composite score was compared to the clinical standard reference for true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) and true negative (TN) rates. \n\nFor the semi-quantitative analyses, several PET metrics were automatically extracted by using FreeSurfer (v7.1.1), an open-source neuroimaging toolkit which provides advanced automated full processing streams for MRI and PET standardization and data extraction. T1-weighted MRI of all the patients was normalized to the Montreal neurological institute (MNI) reference space by using a complete neuro-imaging automated pipeline including nonlinear registration [ \u2013 ], intensity correction [ ] and skull stripping [ ]. The cortical and subcortical brain structures were automatically segmented and labeled [ ]. The Desikan\u2013Killiany\u2013Tourville segmentation mask was applied to the corresponding PET data without partial correction volume. From the segmented  F-DOPA PET/MRI, SUVmean were automatically extracted by using the Freesurfer\u2019s PET/MRI module named Petsurfer [ ,  ]. Because the striatum contralateral to the most affected clinical side typically reflects the most altered SUV ratio in idiopathic Parkinson disease, the minimum SUVmean ratio of Freesurfer-based metrics showing between-group statistical significance on first-line descriptive analyses was retained because of their well-grounded physiopathological relevance: the minimum between   and   SUV ratio (min SUVr) [ \u2013 ], the minimum between   and   SUV ratio (P/C gradient) [ ], the minimum between   and   SUV ratio (intra-striatal gradient) [ ] and asymmetry index [ ] for Putamen SUVmean uptake, computed as follows:  . Finally, potential collinearity between the five  F-DOPA PET metrics (binary visual score and four semi-quantitative) was searched before machine learning procedures by using Spearman nonparametric measure of rank correlations. \n\n\n### Deciphering the contribution of  F-DOPA PET parameters for the identification of IPD \n  \nThe general framework of the statistical analyses is provided in Fig.\u00a0 . Considering the ultimate diagnosis retained by the neurologists at 11\u00a0months of median follow-up, five different embedded machine learning classifiers\u2014k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Log Regression with L1 and L2 regularization (Elastic Net, Log Reg), Support vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and tree gradient boosting (XGBoost)\u2014were learned patient-wise and compared on their capability to predict the final diagnosis of the patients based on the five selected  F-DOPA PET metrics: binary visual score, min SUVr, P/C gradient, intra-striatal gradient and asymmetry index. For this purpose, the dataset was split into training and test sets with a 70%/30% ratio. To prevent overfitting and improve the robustness of the 5 models\u2019 performance, a nested k-fold cross-validation was used during the training phase [ ,  ]. For each model, the hyperparameters tuning was nested under the model selection (inner loop,   k  \u2009=\u20095), model which was assessed on random subsamples of the training set (outer loop,   k  \u2009=\u200910). The overall nested scheme was repeated 100 times. At the end, the best predictive model in average was applied on the testing set to provide unbiased optimized accuracy to predict the diagnosis of IPD. The explainability of the best model was assessed by using the Shapley additive explanations method (SHAP) ( ), which deciphers the contribution of each  F-DOPA PET parameter. Finally, cross-validated ROC curves of the best model performance (  k  \u2009=\u200910) with the most relevant PET parameters were generated and compared. All the statistical analyses were performed with Python (version 3.8; Python Software Foundation) [ ], using pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit learn and xgboost libraries.   \nStatistical analyses. After identifying potential collinearity between the PET metrics, the whole dataset (visual binary interpretation and semi-quantitative PET metrics from 110  F-DOPA PET/MRI) was split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. Five machine learning classifiers (KNN, Log Regression-Log Reg, Support Vector Machine-SVM, Random Forest-RF and tree gradient boosting) were trained to predict the final diagnosis at 11\u00a0months of median follow-up (IPD or control) on the training set by using a nested k-fold cross-validation procedure. (Each model parameters are fine-tuned and cross-validated while optimizing the bias of over fitting.) The overall nested cross-validation procedure was repeated 100 times. The best model on average was applied on the test set to provide general unbiased accuracy. Finally, the contribution of each  F-DOPA PET parameter (the visual and four semi-quantitative metrics) in the model predictions was deciphered \n  \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Population study \n  \nFrom the initial 367 patients addressed in our PET/MRI unit for suspicion of Parkinsonism, a total of 158 medical record has been reviewed. After accounting for excluded patients\u2014lost in follow-up at review time (  n  \u2009=\u200921), who changed protocol because of MRI contraindications (  n  \u2009=\u20096), with atypical Parkinsonism (  n  \u2009=\u200918) and with unsegmentable brain due to severe atrophy in Freesurfer automatic process (  n  \u2009=\u20091) with lost data (  n  \u2009=\u20091)\u2014a total of 110 patients were included. Finally, 110 patients were retained for the analyses, including 48 IPD and 62 patients considered clinically normal (control group). As illustrated in Table  , no between-group statistical significance was observed for age, sex, nor clinical follow-up. Patients median age was 72 and 76\u00a0years old in IPD and control groups, respectively (  p  \u2009=\u20090.126). The IPD group sex ratio was imbalanced compared to the control group, but without statistical significance (M/F\u2009=\u200929/19 vs. 32/30;   p  \u2009=\u20090.360). The overall median clinical follow-up was 330\u00a0days, with longer duration for the IPD group compared to the control group (570 vs. 296\u00a0days,   p  \u2009=\u20090.054).   \nPatients\u2019 characteristics \n  \n IQR   interquartile range \n  \n\n\n### Image processing, data extraction and preparation \n  \nResults of readers final composite score are reported in Table  . Considering a visual interpretation time of less than 2\u00a0min on average, the final composite score of the five readers provided 32/110 TP, 4/110 FP, 16/110 FN, and 58/110 TN, resulting in overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 66,7%, 93.5%, 88.9%, and 78.4%, respectively. Two illustrative cases of visual analysis are provided in Fig.\u00a0 . The distribution of the four  F-DOPA PET semi-quantitative metrics is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0  and provided in Table  . As predefined in the selection process, the between-groups differences were significant for the four semi-quantitative PET metrics. The inter-correlations between the five PET metrics (visual and four semi-quantitative PET metrics) ranged from \u2212\u20090.75 (pair visual and intra-striatal gradient) to 0.61 (pair min SUVr and P/C gradient) (Fig.\u00a0 ), all of them being statistically significant (Spearman rank test,   p  \u2009<\u20090.05).   \nReaders visual analyses, majority vote results, and mean interpretation duration \n  \nMean interpretation time was expressed with 95% confidence interval [95%CI] \n\n TP   true positive,   FP   false positive,   FN   false negative,   TN   true negative \n\n*Pooled mean interpretation duration across the five readers \n    \nVisual analyses of  F-DOPA PET/MRI according to the international guidelines [ ].

As provided in Table  , all the classifiers provided overall good performance to classify IPD and controls. The best classifier was on average the k-NN scheme. This model with fine-tuned hyperparameters provided final test area under the curve (AUC) of the cv-ROC of 0.81. SHAP analyses showed that visual PET metric was the most important contributor to the model overall performance, followed by the min SUVr (Fig.\u00a0 ). Finally, the cross-validated ROC curves of visual, min SUVr or visual combined to min SUVr showed similar performance between visual or semi quantitative metrics (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nModels\u2019 performance on average, after 100 nested cross-validation procedures \n  \nAfter 100 iterations, the k-NN scheme was the best model on average \n    \nShap plot of features\u2019 contribution on the best classifier model output.

The visual mean AUC of visual and min SUVr were similar (0.81). Combining the two parameters did not improve the overall accuracy (0.79) \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our controlled study including 110 participants with a median clinical follow-up reaching 11\u00a0months, the performance of five machine learning procedures with 100-time nested cross-validation were compared to accurately classify IPD from control. Our results demonstrated that among different well-grounded standard PET metrics, visual assessment and semi-quantitative min SUV ratio provided similar performance. In DAT SPECT, despite improvements with CZT systems, the spatial resolution and sensitivity detection remains lower than PET-CT systems, together with the lack of anatomical repairs for accurate realignment of the brain motivated the used of semi-quantitative ratios to limit inter reader variabilities. Although semi-quantification showed increased diagnostic performance in few SPECT studies [ \u2013 ], such approach does not preclude from interobserver variations if performed manually or semi-automatically, and is still considered as an adjunct to visual analysis. Although aromatic  -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) striatal deficiency can be quantified by PET dynamic acquisitions in Parkinsonian syndromes [ ], practical consideration and similar diagnostic performance in cross-sectional studies have led to promote simpler SUV ratios. DAT SPECT and  F-DOPA PET visual interpretation share similar features but have two different targets in dopaminergic neurotransmission that can decrease in parallel but not necessarily synchronously with progression of neurodegenerative Parkinsonism. In theory, in early IPD compensatory mechanisms trigger presynaptic DATs expression is downregulation, and  -amino acid decarboxylase upregulation which is was confirmed in a meta-analysis [ ,  ,  ,  ] demonstrating that AADC defect seen with  F-DOPA PET is consistently smaller than DAT defects in SPECT studies. Nevertheless both are able to diagnose presynaptic dopaminergic deficits in early phases of PD with excellent sensitivity and specificity [ ], to our knowledge no study showed superiority of any procedure and compared to SPECT,  F-DOPA PET provides higher detection sensitivity and spatial resolution, thus allowing very thinner visual assessment of deep brain structures involvement. In this context, and except for particular follow-up study purpose [ \u2013 ], justifying semi-quantification or more sophisticated methods over visual assessment to diagnose Parkinsonism remains largely under evaluated in clinical practice. In the era of precision medicine, the search for new powerful and robust imaging biomarkers constitutes a very hot topic of interest in a wide variety of diseases. In this context, automated image processing workflows have emerged, and could facilitate the interpretation of physicians in daily practice. Motivated by its rational in high spatially resolved morphological imaging, radiomics gradually invades nuclear imaging of oncological and non-oncological diseases, including Parkinsonian syndromes [ \u2013 ]. In their very recent paper, Comte et al. trained and validated a logistic regression model with L1 regularization to identify dopaminergic denervation on  F-DOPA PET/CT [ ]. Among 43 first and higher-orders parameters, three textural features were found to identify abnormal  F-DOPA PET almost as well as a nuclear imaging expert, considered here as the gold standard and study outcome. As mentioned by the authors, the clinical utility of such approach remains unknown, also questioning its conceptual diagnostic relevance in this particular topic, given the limited semiology of  F-DOPA PET pattern abnormalities, and the well-known major logistical drawbacks of handcrafted radiomic pipelines in real-life practice. Recently, the clinical utility of deep-learning based methods to identify Parkinson disease directly from PET data has been emphasized, with very promising results [ \u2013 ]. Deep learning conceptually tackles all the limitations of handcrafted radiomics procedures and would probably constitute a more powerful and efficient alternative to human expert reading for basic imaging identification tasks. In this way, capturing the objective min SUVr from striata, which was here as relevant as visual expert assessment, appears a promising way toward simple assisted analysis workflows. However, multicentric studies are mandatory to overcome the lack of reproducibility of standard PET semi-quantitative metrics related to PET systems image reconstruction properties (the well-known center effect). In accordance with the recent EANM guidelines [ ] visual analysis remains to date the most relevant parameter to predict IPD. \n\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, the median follow-up of 11\u00a0months could have led to potential diagnostic misclassification [ ]. Because the new movement disorder society clinical diagnostic criteria [ ] are currently being judged not useful by the experts in real-life practice [ ] trained neurologists typically make the diagnosis on medical history, clinical symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor) and symptoms evolution under treatment. In atypical cases, staff of experts make their conclusions on a full multidisciplinary work-up. Second, our study included outpatients with mild -early symptoms mainly, for whom clinical diagnosis was ambiguous, justifying the  F-DOPA imaging (in the case of cardinal symptoms, in particular at advanced stages, dopaminergic imaging has no clinical relevance). Because our patients did not have clinical confirmation yet at the time of  F-DOPA PET imaging, the severity score of IPD was not provided at this time, emphasizing the real-life practice conditions of our study. To note, this study was not designed for the PET assessment of disease clinical severity, which is out of the scope of this study and has been widely studied by the past. Third, from hundreds of quantitative morphological and metabolic measures available with Freesurfer and Petsurfer neuroimaging pipeline, only few semi-quantitative metabolic PET metrics were considered clinically relevant given the physiopathology of dopaminergic denervation of striate: SUV metabolic ratios, gradient, and asymmetry indices. This choice was motivated by the fact that (1) we wanted to compare different well-known and usable PET metrics that are easily applicable in routine practice, and more importantly transposable to the individual level which contrasts with recent radiomics studies published; (2) making statistical inference with less than 10 participants per parameter becomes conceptually unacceptable [ ,  ]. Forth, the selected semi-quantitative features were competing with the median performance of five experts that blindly and independently reviewed each case to limit inter-readers potential heterogeneity. One strength of future machine learning model in this context could be the reproducibility of predictions compared to a single expert reading. The main asset in our study is the use of simultaneous PET/MRI acquisition, which improves striatal segmentation from T1-weighted sequence over PET images [ ]. Nevertheless, the potential of MRI cannot be restrained to morphological analysis. Promising results showed high correlation between Parkinson disease and specific MRI-multiparametric brainstem investigation [ ], in particular the iron deposit in the substantia nigra. Recent results also showed correlation between iron deposit in substantia nigra and striatal dopamine denervation seen with  F-DOPA PET [ ,  ]. All these results may promote further research to better capture the relevance of combining  F-DOPA and MRI capabilities in this field. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nVisual expert analysis remains the most relevant parameter to predict IPD diagnosis at 11\u00a0months of median clinical follow-up in  F-DOPA. The min SUV ratio appears interesting in the perspective of simple semi-automated diagnostic workflows. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9925664, "text_md5": "ebc45991cb4ccd79e91b7ce0404622eb", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 161], "publication_year": [163, 167], "title": [178, 343], "keywords": [357, 439], "abstract": [452, 2476], "body": [2485, 28130]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 36780091, "doi": "10.1186/s13550-023-00962-x", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9925664", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9925664"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9925664\">9925664</a>", "list_title": "PMC9925664  Relevance of 18F-DOPA visual and semi-quantitative PET metrics for the diagnostic of Parkinson disease in clinical practice: a machine learning-based inference study"}

T2* gradient echo (T2* GRE), susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging (SWI), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are susceptibility MR imaging sequences that provide more information about brain iron levels than other conventional MR imaging. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM in distinguishing PSP from IPD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nEligible studies were identified via systematic searches of PubMed and Clarivate Analytics\u00ae Web of Science\u00ae Core Collection. Studies that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed. A meta\u2010analysis was conducted using the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve approach. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur literature search of the two databases yielded 562 primary articles, 10 of which were deemed relevant and only six were eligible for further analyses. We performed a meta\u2010analysis of putaminal hypointensity measurements: 438 patients with IPD and 109 patients with PSP were enrolled in the quantitative synthesis. The meta\u2010analysis of six studies with 547 patients revealed a sensitivity of 69% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33%\u201390%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI: 80%\u201396%) for putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM distinguishing PSP from IPD. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nPutaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM is able to distinguish patients with PSP from those with IPD with high specificity. Further multicenter prospective studies on patients are needed to verify our results. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nThe principal clinical features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) are bradykinesia, resting tremors, rigidity, and postural instability. Several other parkinsonisms, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), present with similar clinical manifestations. Because of the overlapping symptoms, it is sometimes challenging to obtain a correct diagnosis. Thus, a sensitive and reliable diagnostic marker is urgently required. Thus, the development of a potential MRI biomarker to differentiate between IPD and PSP is necessary. \n\nIPD and PSP are neurodegenerative diseases that share similar pathogenic mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress,  impairment of protein clearance,  and neuroinflammation.  In addition, dysregulation of metabolism and increased mineral concentrations (especially of iron) are also involved in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases.  Accumulated evidence has shown that the degree of metabolism dysregulation and increase in mineral concentrations in different diseases are inconsistent, and that brain iron deposition patterns differ between neurodegenerative diseases, such as IPD and PSP. ,   These differences can be used as promising imaging features to support clinical diagnosis. \n\nPostmortem studies have revealed that T2 hypointensity in the putamen is associated with ferritin deposition. ,   To distinguish between radiological findings related to pathological mineral deposition and those caused by physiological age\u2010related accumulation in the putamen, selecting an appropriate MRI sequence is crucial. Among the routinely performed MR imaging sequences, T2* gradient echo (T2* GRE) sequences are more sensitive to mineral deposition than T2\u2010weighted sequences. The deposition of paramagnetic substances (such as iron) is related to a decrease in T2* relaxation time, which results in a hypointense signal on T2* GRE imaging. ,   Susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging (SWI) is extremely sensitive to mineralization and substances with magnetic susceptibility and can help evaluate the pattern of mineralization in deep gray matter.  Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can process phase MRI data to yield susceptibility maps and eliminate artifacts by deconvolving the field generated by the magnetic susceptibility.  Postmortem brain studies demonstrated a strong correlation between volumetric susceptibility and iron concentration in the deep gray matter measured using QSM. ,  ,   Previous studies of T2* GRE, SWI and QSM in parkinsonism have supported that they may serve as new biomarkers for clinical use. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM in distinguishing PSP from IPD. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design and search strategy \n  \nOur meta\u2010analysis complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses statement. Database searches were independently performed by two researchers (YY and ZJM) in PubMed and the Clarivate Analytics\u00ae Web of Science\u00ae Core Collection. We used the following search keywords: (\u201cswi\u201d OR \u201cmagnitude\u201d OR \u201csusceptibility\u2010weighted image\u201d OR \u201ceswan\u201d OR \u201cEnhanced T2 Star Weighted Angiography\u201d OR \u201ct2*\u201d OR \u201cr2*\u201d OR \u201cphase\u201d OR \u201cgradient echo\u201d OR \u201cGRE\u201d) AND (\u201cProgressive supranuclear palsy\u201d OR \u201cPSP\u201d) AND (\u201cParkinson's disease\u201d OR \u201cIPD\u201d). Only papers published between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2022, were considered. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nTwo independent researchers screened the papers considering the following eligibility criteria: (1) written in English. (2) including PSP and IPD patients. (3) T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM of the brain had been performed; and (4) reporting the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives or total samples as well as sensitivity and specificity values. \n\n\n### Data extraction and analysis \n  \nQuality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u20102 (QUADAS\u20102) tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in each study. Two researchers conducted the assessments independently. Any divergence was resolved through discussion and consensus. Data from the qualifying studies were extracted as follows: (1) patient numbers in each group; (2) sensitivity and specificity values; (3) clinical features (age, sex, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr scale); and (4) MRI technical parameters (sequences, positive radiologic definition, magnetic field strength, slice thickness, echo time [TE], and spatial resolution). Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve (HSROC) modeling was performed to calculate the general sensitivity and specificity, based on the bivariate normal model for the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity values reported in each study, and a 95% confidence region and 95% prediction region were provided.  Forest plots of sensitivity and specificity were created for the visual assessment. Potential heterogeneity between the datasets was assessed using the inconsistency index (I ). I \u00a0=\u200925%\u201350% was regarded as low heterogeneity, I \u00a0=\u200950%\u201375% was considered moderate heterogeneity, and I \u00a0>\u200975% represented high heterogeneity.  Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA software (STATA 13.1). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA systematic search of PubMed and Clarivate Analytics\u00ae Web of Science\u00ae Core Collection revealed 562 publications. After excluding 54 duplicates, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining 508 publications and identified 30 potentially eligible original articles. After full\u2010text screening, 20 publications were excluded because they had no relevant outcomes. A total of 10 publications were included in the qualitative analyses. However, four publications were evaluated using continuous variables and could not be quantified together. Finally, six articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in our meta\u2010analysis. A detailed flowchart of the selection process is shown in Figure\u00a0 . The characteristics of the selected studies are presented in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nFlowchart of the studies included in the meta\u2010analysis. \n    \nStudy and patient characteristics \n    \nAs shown in Figure\u00a0 , of the studies included, 50% (3 of 6) for patient selection, 83.3% (5 of 6) for index test, 33.3% (2 of 6) for reference standard and 16.6% (1 of 6) for flow and timing showed a low risk of bias. The rest assessment indicated unclear risk of bias. \n\nThe six studies included 109 PSP patients and 438 IPD patients. The overall sensitivity and specificity for discriminating PSP from IPD patients were 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33\u20130.90) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.80\u20130.96), respectively (Fig.\u00a0 ). Considerable heterogeneity between studies was indicated by I  scores of 82.41 and 85.73 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88\u20130.93) (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n  \nCoupled forest plot of pooled sensitivity and specificity. Pooled estimates with 95% CIs are provided.

Gupta et al.  reported that hypointensity scores of the red nucleus (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.001) and substantia nigra (  P  \u00a0=\u00a00.006) were higher in the PSP group than in the IPD group. Azuma et al.  demonstrated that the mean susceptibility values of the substantia nigra and globus pallidus were significantly higher in PSP patients than those in IPD patients (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al.  also found an apparent increase in the susceptibility of the red nucleus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.0001), globus pallidus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.0001), substantia nigra (  P  \u2009<\u20090.0001), and dentate nucleus (  P  \u2009<\u20090.0001) in PSP patients compared to those in IPD patients. \n\nTwo studies used the SWI sequence, ,   two used T2* GRE, ,   and two used QSM to obtain images. ,   For field strength, three studies used 3.0\u2009T, ,  ,   two used 1.5\u00a0T, ,   and one used 1.5\u00a0T or 3.0\u2009T.  The magnetic susceptibility of the bilateral putamina was measured in three studies, ,  ,   and the visual presence of putaminal hypointensity was evaluated in three. ,  ,   Out of three visually evaluated studies, Arabia et al. demonstrated that the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for intrarater and interrater reliability in the evaluation of the putaminal intensity were 1.000 and 0.939 in the IPD group, and 0.886 and 1.000 in the PSP group (  P  \u2009<\u20090.001).  Gupta et al. reported that ICCs of intrarater and interrater reliability were 0.7 and 0.9 for the putamen.  Wadia et al. showed that the kappa value for intrarater and interrater reliability analysis involving GRE hypointensity of the putamen were 1.0 and 0.4576, respectively.  The TE was 40 in two studies, ,   20 in one,  and 15 in one.  Two studies used more than one kind of TE. ,   The slice thickness used ranged from 2 to 5\u2009mm, and the interslice gap varied from 0 to 2\u2009mm. Four studies did not mention the years of experience of the image raters ,  ,  ,  ; two studies included the data (more than 10\u2009years,  8, and 11\u2009years, respectively ). \n\nAlthough four articles were not included in our quantitative analysis, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al.  and Mazzucchi et al.  found that putamen susceptibility was higher in PSP patients than in PD patients. However, Fedeli et al.  and Sakurai et al.  did not observe any differences. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur meta\u2010analysis evaluated the diagnostic performance of putaminal hypointensity on T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM to discriminate PSP from IPD. The pooled sensitivity was 69% (95% CI: 3%\u201390%), the specificity was 91% (95% CI: 80%\u201396%), and the area under the HSROC curve was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88\u20130.93). This indicates that putaminal hypointensity on SWI, T2* GRE, and QSM help distinguish PSP from IPD. \n\nSometimes, it is difficult to distinguish PSP from IPD using only the clinical diagnostic criteria, and neuroimaging plays a vital role in further differentiation. Iron accumulation leads to considerable local magnetic field inhomogeneity, causing a decline in the local signal (susceptibility gradient). Some studies have demonstrated that low putaminal signal intensity on T2\u2010weighted images in atypical and poorly levodopa\u2010responsive parkinsonism. ,   MRI and postmortem neuropathological studies have shown that MRI putaminal signal changes are associated with mineral deposition, cell damage, and gliosis within the putamen, ,  ,   implicating putaminal mineral deposition as a neuropathological marker of parkinsonism. The paramagnetic effect of mineral deposition in the cerebrum leads to a hypointense signal on T2* GRE imaging. ,   SWI is a comparatively new technique for identifying iron deposition in the brain. By using magnitude and phase images, SWI can reveal both quantified and visible brain mineralization with high sensitivity. ,   QSM is a new post\u2010processing technique that can evaluate iron concentrations in the cerebrum by mapping phase\u2010MRI data.  Currently, T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM are all neuroimaging techniques used in clinical practice. Therefore, in our study, they were all considered index tests. The overall diagnostic yield of T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM was 69% (95% CI: 33%\u201390%), and the specificity (91% CI: 80%\u201396%) was high, indicating that brain MRI including T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM would be a useful tool for distinguishing PSP from IPD. \n\nIn addition to the putamen, some studies indicated that the susceptibility of the red nucleus, substantia nigra, and globus pallidus could also be used to distinguish PSP from PD. ,  ,   The latest study even showed that diagnostic accuracy comparing PD and PSP ranged from good (Putamen, Subthalamic nucleus) to optimal (red nucleus).  However, there have been only a few related studies, which used different imaging techniques, so no unified conclusion can be drawn yet. \n\nPutaminal hypointensity on susceptibility MRI is a non\u2010specific imaging finding which can also be seen in multiple system atrophy (MSA).  Several studies have found that putaminal hypointensity can also distinguish MSA from PD. ,  ,   These suggest that putaminal hypointensity on susceptibility MRI can help to differentiate patients with PSP or MSA from IPD, but cannot support a PSP or MSA diagnosis in patients presenting with parkinsonism. Whether this could have a role in distinguishing between each parkinsonism requires more and further research. \n\nIn addition to susceptibility MRI, other neuroimaging techniques also contribute to distinguishing PSP from IPD, each with its advantages and shortcomings. Though midbrain atrophy and characteristic \u201chummingbird\u201d shape on midsagittal T1\u2010weighted images are highly specific (99.5%), those signs are less sensitive (51.6%).  MRPI and MRPI 2.0 have been used to distinguish between these two diseases in their early stages with high accuracy ,  ; however, they require expertise in manual measurement and MR image reconstruction, which is complex and limits their widespread use. The automated version of MRPI 2.0, which is currently under development, also requires certain technical skills and is not applicable to routine MRI procedures. A new simple manual MRI measurement of the third ventricle (3 rd V) width showed the 3 rd V/ID ratio demonstrated high diagnostic performance (accuracy >87% and AUC >91%) in distinguishing IPD from PSP patients.  As the MRI images were from different 1.5\u2010 and 3.0\u2010T scanners, the variability might have increased. A recent study demonstrated great potential for diagnosing suspected PSP using  F\u2010PI\u20102620 PET. When using at least one positive target region, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting PSP\u2010RS are 85% and 77%, respectively.  However,  F\u2010PI\u20102620 PET imaging is extremely expensive and difficult to perform in clinical practice. Compared with those above\u2010mentioned neuroimaging techniques, susceptibility MRI is cheaper and easier to perform and showed a good diagnostic performance in discriminating PSP from IPD. \n\nThere was substantial heterogeneity in our meta\u2010analysis, and several factors might have caused this variability: (1) magnetic resonance field strength, slice thickness, and spatial resolution were different among the studies included in this meta\u2010analysis: two studies used 1.5\u00a0T, ,   three used 3.0\u2009T ,  ,   and one used both field strengths ; thinner slice thickness and smaller interslice gaps displayed better detection results; (2) The evaluation methods for positive imaging results were different: some studies used visual evaluation to compare the signal of the thalamus,  cerebrospinal fluid  and globus pallidus ; however, quantitative studies used magnetic susceptibility values measured by in\u2010house software programs ,   or ImageJ. ; (3) Differences in the placement and size of the region of interest (ROI) might also have affected the results: although most studies focused on the putamen, some divided it into frontal putamen and posterior putamen,  while others focused on the outer putamen.  Standardized placement of the ROI may help coordinate the results among different study sites; and (4) The drawing methods for the ROI were different: most studies used manually drawn ROI and only one study used automatic segmentation.  It remains unclear which method can provide better test\u2013retest reliability. \n\nThe difficulty in the clinical diagnosis of IPD and PSP may contribute to heterogeneity. Although the studies used similar clinical diagnostic criteria, none of the patients in these studies were confirmed by pathological examination. Misdiagnosis in some cases cannot be excluded, especially in those in early disease stages. Since the accuracy of clinical diagnosis increases with disease progression, most studies involved patients in the advanced stages, making clinical diagnosis more reliable. When clinical identification becomes more difficult, it is necessary to test the diagnostic performance of T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM for these diseases. \n\nOur study had several limitations. First, only a few studies published thus far have focused on this aspect, and several related studies could not be included in the pooled analysis because of the unavailability of their original data. Consequently, only six studies were included, which might have affected the accuracy of the results. However, the sensitivity and specificity have certain confidence intervals, and excluded one or two studies would not have affected the overall results. Second, one study was retrospective; therefore, the possibility of selection bias could not be excluded. Third, because of the limited number of studies, we did not assess the heterogeneity caused by the three different sequences as indicator tests nor were we able to determine the relationship between severity and T2* GRE, SWI, or QSM abnormalities. Fourth, our pooled analysis revealed significant heterogeneity, which affected the applicability of our results. Nevertheless, in view of the clinical practicability of T2* GRE, SWI, and QSM, it was highly necessary to conduct this meta\u2010analysis, and its results still have a certain practicability to help people make clinical decisions or perform further analyses. \n\nIn conclusion, although the sensitivity of T2*GRE, SWI, and QSM is still far from ideal, their good specificity prove that they might be a promising diagnostic tool for distinguishing PSP from IPD. Large\u2010scale multicenter imaging studies and long\u2010term clinical follow\u2010up for parkinsonism are needed to verify their diagnostic efficiency. \n\n\n## Author Roles \n  \n(1) Research project: A.

We investigated structural brain change in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and examined its relationship with memory impairment.   Methods.   Twenty-three PD-MCI patients were enrolled and underwent cognitive evaluation and 3-dimensional T1-weighted imaging. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess brain-behavior correlations and examine the relationship between insula and memory score. VOI methods replicated results obtained from VBM.   Results.   VBM uncovered the notion that memory scores were positively correlated with the gray matter (GM) density in the insular cortex and a significant positive correlation between overall cognitive performance and concentration of GM within the lateral temporal cortex. In VOI analyses, our results suggested a positive correlation between the insula and composite free-recall verbal memory (  \u03c1   = 0.617,   P   = 0.003) and the delayed free-recall verbal memory subdomain (  \u03c1   = 0.725,   P   < 0.001). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the insula and caudate (  \u03c3   = 0.570,   P   = 0.006) and putamen volume (  \u03c3   = 0.683,   P   < 0.001).   Conclusions.   In patients with PD-MCI, atrophic changes in the insula may be related to memory deficits, and the brain-behavior correlation may be associated with atrophic change in the striatum within the salience network. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nAlthough Parkinson disease (PD) is considered to be a motor disorder, cognitive dysfunctions are known to range from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to PD dementia [ ]. Among nondemented PD patients, MCI in PD (PD-MCI) is common and is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, which can occur in as many as 80% of PD patients, especially those at an advanced stage [ ]. Multiple pathologic processes have been linked to the development of behavioral symptoms in PD patients before the demented stage, including degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei and degeneration of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic circuits [ ], which is thought to induce memory dysfunction [ ]. \n\nDisruption of dopaminergic modulation in salience network connectivity between the insular cortex and the hippocampus is implicated in memory deficits observed in PD [ ]. While long-term memory abnormality in PD results from prefrontal atrophy-induced working memory disorganization [ ], a disconnected network between the insula and medial temporal and dopaminergic neurons in the striatum could contribute to impairment of memory consolidation and retrieval in PD [ ,  ]. In addition, insula atrophy is associated with memory deficits progression in MCI subjects [ ] and cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, and sensorimotor disturbances through its reciprocal connections with the medial temporal, striatum, and supplementary motor cortices [ ]. \n\nIn addition to motor function deterioration, PD progression is manifested clinically with cognitive decline and structurally with brain atrophy. Reduced gray matter (GM) volume in PD includes not only the subcortical area (caudate and putamen) but also the cortex (prefrontal and temporal) [ ]. By permitting brain-behavior correlations, advances in neuroimaging have provided insight into abnormal cognition in PD and have revolutionized clinical neuropsychology. There have been reports of correlations between verbal memory and ventricular enlargement and between memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy before the demented stage in PD. In another study of demented PD patients, several cortical areas, including the prefrontal gyrus, medial temporal gyrus, and insula, were found to correlate with Raven Colored Progressive Matrices representing the ability of complicated thinking and information storage. \n\nThe methods used to assess the relationship between structural change and cognitive impairment in PD include volume of interest (VOI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The VOI method measures the correlation between cognition and manually delineated and anatomically defined regions within the brain [ ]. VBM is a fully automated whole brain measurement technique that maps the statistical association between cognition and regional tissue volume or density [ ]. Although VBM provides a nonbiased measure of regions within the whole brain measurement, transforming the shape of the brain image during the normalization stage within the VBM analyses may distort the abnormal tissue and artificially inflate the cortical surface. While VBM analyses are less sensitive to shape differences among subjects, the VOI approach provides statistical evaluation of morphometric data of brain cortical regions and has the strength of anatomical validity. However, studies using the VOI method require predefined anatomical regions based on an a priori hypothesis. Thus, it is important to replicate the result shown in the within-voxel concentrations of GM revealed in VBM and the absolute volumes as calculated in VOI analyses. \n\nThe aim of the study was to identify the GM atrophic changes that are associated with global cognitive measures and memory performance in PD. We used both VOI and VBM to correlate regional cortical volume and GM density to performance on cognitive scores in PD-MCI patients. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nThis was a single-center, prospective, observational study. The patients were recruited from the Department of Neurology of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from the year 2013 to 2014. Twenty-three patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD [ ] underwent comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological assessments with consensus rendered at a multidisciplinary conference. In cognitive assessment, all of the patients were assessed in the \u201con\u201d state and were devoid of anticholinergic medication. The inclusion criteria were gradual decline in cognitive ability reported by the patient, cognitive deficits on a global cognitive test, and cognitive deficits that did not interfere significantly with functional independence in daily living and occupational activities [ ]. Patients were included only if they had at least two scorings below the cutoff value of the cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ ], cognitive abilities screen instrument (CASI) and its subdomain [ ], and PD dementia- (PDD-) short screen and its subdomain [ ]). The exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of PD dementia (PDD) based on the 294.1 criteria for PDD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [ ]. The hospital's Human Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, and all of the participants and their authorized caregivers provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### 2.2. MRI Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nMRI was performed using a GE 3T Signa Excite scanner. Structural images were acquired for anatomic reference and clinical diagnosis verification using the following protocols: (1) T2-weighted, turbo spin-echo sequence with repetition time/echo time/number of averages of 4200\u2009ms/101.2\u2009ms/2, 240 \u00d7 240\u2009mm field of view, 320 \u00d7 224 matrix, and 5\u2009mm axial slice thickness, and (2) T1-weighted, inversion-recovery-prepared, 3-dimensional (3D), spoiled, gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady-state sequence with repetition time/inversion time of 8,600\u2009ms/450\u2009ms, 240 \u00d7 240\u2009mm field of view, and 1\u2009mm slice thickness. \n\n#### 2.2.1. VBM Analysis \n  \nUsing the latest version of SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United Kingdom), MRIs were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid images by a unified tissue-segmentation procedure after image-intensity nonuniformity correction. These segmented gray and white matter images were then spatially normalized to the customized template in the standardized anatomic space using DARTEL (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience) [ ]. The gray and white matter volumes within each voxel were preserved by modulating the images using the Jacobean determinants derived from the spatial normalization by DARTEL, and then they were smoothed using a 12\u2009mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. For the correlation analyses with global cognitive performance and memory scores, we used multiple regression analysis and an uncorrected threshold of   P   < 0.001 with a cluster size of >50. \n\n\n#### 2.2.2. Volumetric Analysis \n  \nUsing the Individual Brain Atlases Using Statistical Parametric Mapping (IBASPM) ( ) [ ], individual 3D T1-weighted MRI images were segmented into different anatomic structures using the Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas [ ]. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined and expressed in cubic millimeters. Selection of VOI was based on the findings from multiple regression analysis in VBM. The raw regional volume and total intracranial volume (TIV) were calculated. \n\n\n\n### 2.3. Neuropsychological Assessment \n  \nA trained neuropsychologist administered the tests. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ ], cognitive abilities screen instrument (CASI) [ ], and PDD-short screen [ ]. Delayed free-recall verbal memory was used to represent memory encoding and retrieval. We further calculated the composite free-recall verbal memory to recheck the results. This was composed of the immediate free-recall verbal memory score of the PDD-short screen and short-term memory score of CASI. \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). In addition to VBM, the cognitive performance and volumetric data obtained from VOI analyses were assessed using multivariate linear regression analysis. For structural-structural relationships, in addition to Spearman's analysis for VOI analysis, multivariate linear regression analysis was used to test the independent associations between the insula and basal ganglia. To assess the appropriateness of using parametric statistics for these analyses, we used the Kolmogorov-Simonov test to examine the normality, and   P   values >0.05 indicated no significant deviations from normality. All statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software package (version 18 for Windows\u00ae, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) substructures. \n\n\n\n## 3. Result \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics \n  \nTwenty-three patients completed the study ( ). The TIV was 1389.1 \u00b1 132.2 (range: 1197.8\u20131644.4), and regional volume in descending order was follows: superior temporal gyrus: 12.8 \u00b1 1.8 (range: 10.0\u201318.7), insula: 11.4 \u00b1 4.7 (range: 8.9\u201315.7), putamen: 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 (range: 3.5\u20137.8), caudate: 4.6 \u00b1 0.8 (range: 3.0\u20136.2), and pallidum: 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 (range: 0.3\u20131.7). \n\n\n### 3.2. Memory Scores with Cortical Atrophy Using VBM Analysis \n  \nVBM measures that explain the delayed free-recall verbal memory subdomain of PDD-short screen ( ) were seen in bilateral lateral temporal gyrus and bilateral insula (BA 13). Further rechecking of the result revealed significant positive correlations between composite free-recall verbal memory ( ) and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA21/22) and bilateral insula (BA 13) ( ). \n\n\n### 3.3. Memory Scores with Regional Cortical Volume \n  \nBased on the result of VBM study, we chose insula and superior temporal gyrus as our VOI ( ). In VOI analysis, there was a significant relationship between TIV-adjusted insula volume and memory scores. After controlling for age and education in linear regression analysis, larger insula volume was associated with better performance in the composite free-recall verbal memory (  \u03b2   coefficient = 0.832,   P   = 0.003) and delayed free-recall verbal memory subdomains (  \u03b2   coefficient = 0.809,   P   < 0.001). None of these memory score volumes were associated with regional volume in superior temporal gyrus (  P   > 0.05). \n\n\n### 3.4. Cognitive Performance with Cortical Atrophy Using VBM and VOI Analysis \n  \nIn VBM analysis, MMSE, CASI, and PDD-short screen did not associate with gray matter integrity in any cortical region. In the VOI analyses, we observed significant positive correlations between cognitive performance and TIV-adjusted insula volume. After controlling for age and education, a larger insula volume was associated with better performance in CASI (  \u03c1   = 0.498,   P   = 0.022), MMSE (  \u03c1   = 0.463,   P   = 0.034), and PDD-short screen (  \u03c1   = 0.463,   P   = 0.034). None of the other regional cortical volumes were associated with cognitive performance (  P   > 0.05). \n\n\n### 3.5. Examining the Relationship between Insular Volume and Basal Ganglion Volume \n  \nAs the dopaminergic neuron in the striatum was thought to modulate insula activity within the salience network, the relationship between insular volume and the striatum was examined. After controlling for age, data for the Spearman correlations between insulae with basal ganglia substructure volumes ( ) revealed a significant correlation between TIV-adjusted insula volume and volume of the TIV-adjusted caudate (  \u03c3   = 0.515,   P   = 0.014) and TIV-adjusted putamen (  \u03c3   = 0.522,   P   = 0.013). The 3D statistical maps showed TIV-adjusted insular volume correlated strongly with gray matter integrity in the bilateral caudate nuclei ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis study investigated the associations between cognitive performance and GM density in PD-MCI patients using VBM and related VOI volumetric measurements, from which there were several major findings. First, we established that memory impairment in PD is associated with loss of insular volume, using VBM as well as VOI-based methods. There were (1) a positive correlation between memory performance scores and insular volume and (2) an association between insular volume and striatum volume among the PD patients in the present study. While both VOI and VBM analyses showed a positive correlation between the insula and caudate, our results showed an association between the 2 interconnected structures within the salience network. Second, lateral temporal volume was positively associated with global cognitive performance, and the results obtained in further VOI analyses replicated those from VBM studies. Third, the insula volume was insufficient to explain the global cognitive deficits, while relationships were seen only in VOI volumetric correlations. Using VBM, only a small cluster of the right insulae was found to be associated with PDD-short screen. \n\n### 4.1. Role of Insula Volume in Memory Scores \n  \nThe association of reduced insula volume with memory deficits and the positive correlation with caudate volume in PD-MCI patients suggests that volume changes of structure within the salience network contributed to memory dysfunction. There has been a growing interest in exploring the crucial role of the insula in PD due to the reciprocal projections to functional regions of the striatum [ ]. Striatal dopamine depletion in PD was reported to be associated with loss of dopaminergic modulation in the insula of PD-MCI patients [ ]. The striatum is functionally and structurally connected to the insula and has been described as a cognitive hub and key region of a salience network [ ]. A correlation between the D2 receptor within the insula and memory scores has been shown in PD-MCI patients [ ]. The salience network is crucial for its interaction with the medial temporal lobe and is engaged in memory encoding and retrieval in PD patients [ ,  ], through switching between the central executive and default mode network [ ]. Pathways from the striatal projection to the insula are difficult to represent in volumetric analyses of positive correlations of the insula with the caudate. While the insula is an important target underlying executive function and memory, disruption of the normal function of the insula as well as the salience network occurs in early disease stages [ ,  ] and has an impact on cognition in PD-MCI. As our results showed that the insula was positively correlated with caudate volume and positively related to memory performance, the brain-behavior correlations provided in both VBM and VOI analysis pointed to the importance of the insula. \n\n\n### 4.2. Insula Volume Contribution to Global Cognitive Decline in PD-MCI \n  \nThe insula is highly interconnected with the basal ganglia and many cortical regions including the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions [ ]. Functional roles of the insula may include cognitive/affective and somatosensory awareness through the corticocortical circuitry [ ]. Thus, while the insula is able to interact with multiple brain networks, the corticostriatal circuitry has been the main anatomical target of many of the symptoms of PD [ ]. The insula has abnormal activation patterns in PD patients during cognitive tasks [ ], and the cortical regions, including the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which functionally connect with the insula also show abnormal activation in patients with cognitive dysfunction [ ]. As atrophy in angular and middle occipital gyri, middle frontal and precentral gyri, supplementary motor and inferior frontal gyri, instead of insula cortex, has been reported in PD-MCI patients [ ], we suggested insula volume could affect cognition in PD-MCI even before appearance of gray matter atrophy in insula. However, differences in the atrophic pattern may vary with races, years of PD evolution, severity of motor disability, and educational level of PD [ ,  ]. Using photon emission tomography imaging, loss of dopamine receptor availability in the right insula was seen to contribute to cognitive deficits in PD-MCI [ ]. Furthermore, the dopaminergic pathway in bilateral insula of PD-MCI patients was reduced compared with that of healthy controls. The small cluster of the right insulae that was found to be associated with PDD-short screen using VBM methods was insufficient to explain the global cognitive deficits. The relationship between the insula and overall cognitive testing of CASI and MMSE in VOI volumetric correlations in the present study suggests that when taking bilateral insula into consideration, insular dysfunctions are associated with cognitive deficits in PD-MCI patients. \n\n\n### 4.3. Lateral Temporal Volume Associated with Cognitive Scores \n  \nSignificant cortical thinning in the middle temporal gyrus was seen in PD patients without dementia [ ]. MMSE, representing overall cognitive performance, showed a positive correlation with thickness of the temporal cortices in another study [ ]. In addition to volumetric data, reduced cerebral blood flow in the lateral temporal regions was found in PD patients [ ]. Our findings with respect to the association between overall cognitive performance and the lateral temporal volume are in concordance with a recent cross-sectional study of PD patients with a different cognitive disease stage [ ] and another study with nondemented PD patients [ ]. \n\nVBM provides a brain-behavior measurement after transforming the shape of the brain image, which may distort the abnormal tissue, and volumetric analysis using the VOI technique after the GM segmentation-based volume quantification method replicates the results obtained from the VBM method. Although our GM segmented VOI technique required manual rechecking and thus was labor-intensive to ensure correct coregistration in each subject, the VOI approach provides landmark-based analyses and has the strength of anatomical validity. Both VBM and VOI analyses showed a direct association of the lateral temporal volume with CASI and MMSE in this study, which reinforces the significance of the crucial role of the lateral temporal volume in PD-MCI. \n\n\n\n## 5. Limitations and Conclusion \n  \nSeveral limitations in our study need to be further discussed. First, we used memory subdomain scores of CASI and PDD-short screen to assess memory function. Different memory processes, such as encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, were not dissociated and discussed separately. The relationship between memory performance and insular cortex was reported after careful statistical examination by VBM and VOI methods and rechecking 3 separate memory subdomain scores of CASI and PDD-short screen. In addition, there might have been selection bias in which only PD-MCI patients were enrolled in the study, and among PD-MCI patients, we did not select patients with exclusively impaired memory performance in PD-MCI. Furthermore, PD-MCI patients in this study only fulfilled the guidelines for level I categories. However, patient selection involved the avoidance of overall volume atrophy, which would obscure exploration of the association between regional cortical atrophy and cognitive performance. \n\nIn conclusion, our study indicates that insular volume atrophy, which was distantly interconnected with the striatum, may contribute to memory deficits in PD-MCI patients. While memory performance is related to insular volume, changes in lateral temporal volume could contribute to overall cognitive decline in PD-MCI patients. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4779527, "text_md5": "1e91c92588b783c4863c7d78452d61ae", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 165], "publication_year": [167, 171], "title": [182, 349], "keywords": [363, 363], "abstract": [376, 1804], "body": [1813, 21519]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26998378, "doi": "10.1155/2016/2939528", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779527", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4779527"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779527\">4779527</a>", "list_title": "PMC4779527  Insula Volume and Salience Network Are Associated with Memory Decline in Parkinson Disease: Complementary Analyses of Voxel-Based Morphometry versus Volume of Interest"}

A 54-year-old man presented with a history of 3 months of severe shuffling gait, rigidity, slow movements of the left side limbs, and difficulty managing finances. A brain MRI revealed marked ventriculomegaly (Evans index = 0.42). The patient was diagnosed with INPH and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Cognitive impairment improved, but walking disturbances, slowness, and rigidity persisted. Then treatment with levodopa was added, and the patient experienced a sustained improvement. He was diagnosed with PD. After 7 years, the patient developed gait freezing and severe levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The patient underwent bilateral GPi-DBS. We used MRI/CT fusion techniques for anatomical indirect targeting. Indirect targeting is based on standardized stereotactic atlas and on a formula\u2014derived method based on AC-PC landmarks. The AC-PC line was 40 mm (the usual length is between 19 and 32 mm). Intraoperative microelectrode recording was a non-expendable test, but multiple recordings were avoided to reduce the surgical risk of ventricular involvement. There was a 71% decrease in the UPDRS III score during the on-stimulation state (28 to 8). The patient's dyskinesias resolved dramatically with a UdysRS of 15 (88% improvement) during the on-stimulation condition. The observed motor benefits and the improvement of his daily activities have persisted 6 months after surgery. Deep brain stimulation surgery in PD with ventriculomegaly is a challenge. This procedure can result in a greater chance of breaching the ventricle, with risks of intraventricular hemorrhage and migration of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain parenchyma with target displacement. Furthermore, clinical judgment is paramount when recent onset of shuffling gait coexists with ventriculomegaly because the most common dilemma is differentiating between PD and INPH. For these reasons, neurologists and surgeons may refuse to operate on PD patients with ventriculomegaly. However, DBS should be considered for PD patients with motor complications when responsiveness to levodopa is demonstrated, even in the context of marked ventriculomegaly. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in Parkinson's disease (PD) with ventriculomegaly is a challenge. This procedure can result in a greater chance of breaching the ventricle, with risks of intraventricular hemorrhage and migration of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain parenchyma around the leads with subsequent target displacement. Furthermore, clinical judgment is paramount when recent onset of shuffling gait coexists with ventriculomegaly because the most common dilemma is differentiating between PD and idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus   (  INPH) ( ,  ). For these reasons, neurologists and surgeons may refuse to operate on PD patients with ventriculomegaly. Here, we report a successful bilateral globus pallidus internus-deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) for a PD patient with INPH with marked ventriculomegaly and an unusually long anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. \n\n\n## Case report \n  \nFifty-four year-old man presented with a history of 3 months of severe shuffling gait, urinary incontinence, and difficulty managing finances and keeping track of appointments. On examination a soft voice, a delay in left shoulder shrug and mild cogwheel rigidity in the left arm were noticeable. A brain MRI revealed marked ventriculomegaly (calculated Evans index = 0.42) ( ) (Figure  ). A lumbar puncture with removal of 50 ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed. The CSF was clear and colorless with an opening pressure of 18 cmH 0. After the spinal test, Mini-Mental State Examination scored improved from 23/30 to 29/30 and the patient subjectively experienced significant relief from his gait-related symptoms, showing a 10% of increase in his walking speed. INPH was diagnosed and a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was placed (Figure  ). Cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence improved, but the parkinsonian features persisted. Then treatment with levodopa was added, and the patient experienced a sustained improvement. It was thought that PD coexisted with INPH. Five years later, he presented with acute headache and cognitive impairment. Shunt obstruction which necessitated surgical intervention was diagnosed. The VP shunt was replaced and these acute symptoms resolved. \n  \nBrain MRI (  A  : T1 axial slice;   B  : T1 sagittal slice;   C  : T2 axial slice).   (A)   There is marked ventriculomegaly. The maximum width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles is 5.8 cm; the maximal internal diameter of the skull at the same level is 13.9 cm; the calculated Evans index is 0.42 (normal value: < 0.3).   (B)   The anterior commissure\u2013 posterior commissure line is drawn, and its length is 4.0 cm; this line is an important landmark for stereotactic targeting in GPi-DBS.   (C)   The third ventricle is also dilated, and there is prominent flow void artifact (white straight arrows); this artifact means that CSF flow velocity is high and there is no obstruction. Magnetic susceptibility artifacts due to ventriculoperitoneal catheter and valve (white stars). \n  \nAfter 7 years on levodopa treatment, the patient developed gait freezing and severe levodopa-induced dyskinesia. He was treated with various combinations of trihexyphenidyl, amantadine, pramipexole, and levodopa, up to a maximum tolerated dose (1,500 mg daily), with minimal benefit to his overall functions. At an outside institution, DBS surgery was not considered due to diagnostic and technical concerns; the latter were related to the ventriculomegaly that could complicate the accurate placement of the DBS leads. \n\nAt the age of 67, the patient was subsequently referred to our institution. Motor score following a levodopa challenge decreased from 45 to 28 on UPDRS III (40% improvement). The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) was very high (128 out of a maximum of 196). A battery of neurocognitive tests showed no signs of cognitive impairment. After a long discussion with the patient and his family on the pro and cons of the surgery, we decided to carry out DBS because the patient was suffering from medically intractable parkinsonism. The patient underwent bilateral GPi-DBS. We chose the ventral GPi in order to suppress dyskinesia and because its more lateral position compared to the subthalamic nucleus reduces the risk of breaching the ventricle walls. We used MRI/CT fusion techniques for anatomical indirect targeting with a stereotactic CT frame. Anterior and posterior commissures were identified, and the AC-PC line was 40 mm (the usual length of the AC-PC line is measured between 19 and 32 mm). The coordinates for the right GPi were 27.38 mm lateral (X), 1.85 mm anterior (Y), and \u22128 mm inferior (Z) to the midpoint of the intercommisural AC-PC line (10.7\u00b0 from mid-sagittal plane and 53.3\u00b0 from axial plane). For the left GPi the coordinates were X: \u221225.35 mm, Y: 3.69 mm, and Z: \u22128.42 mm (11.7\u00b0 from mid-sagittal plane and 67.3\u00b0 from axial plane). The right burr-hole placement was shifted laterally to avoid the right VP shunt and the enlarged frontal horns of the lateral ventricles (please see Additional File  : CT video). The number of microelectrode trajectories was reduced to only one. Intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER) identified the neuronal firing pattern of the GPi. Recordings were performed in steps of 0.5\u20131 mm, from 15 mm above the presumed target until 3 mm below the target. Microstimulation with trains of high-frecuency (200 Hz) and currents from 0.5 to 5 mA was performed in order to test for proximity of the internal capsule, without any noticeable twitching or contraction coincident with stimulation. Visual evoked responses were obtained by a stimulus of light delivered as a flash and the optic tract was identified at the base of both GPi. The GPi-DBS lead placement was confirmed on a postoperative CT scan (Figure  ). \n  \nPostoperative GPi-DBS exams (  A  : skull radiography frontal view;   B   and   C  : brain CT coronal slices). The lead tracts (white curved arrows) avoid the right ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter (white arrowheads) and the enlarged frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Superimposed fused images between preoperative T2 MRI and postoperative CT (  D  : axial;   E  : coronal) confirmed the lead placement on the GPi bilaterally (white straight arrows). \n  \nTwo weeks after leads placement, monopolar stimulation of the left dorsal and right ventral contacts (1-/11-) at 3.2 V in the left GPi and 3.6 V in the right GPi with a frequency of 130 Hz and pulse duration of 90 ms led to the best clinical response. There was a 71% decrease in the UPDRS III score during the on-stimulation state (28 to 8). The patient's dyskinesias resolved dramatically with a UdysRS of 15 (88% improvement) during the on-stimulation condition. The observed motor benefits and the improvement of his daily activities have persisted 10 months after surgery. (Please see Additional File  : movie shows the before/after surgery; medication-off/stimulation-on condition). \n\nThe subject gave written informed consent for the publication of this case report and video files in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first report on DBS in a PD patient with INPH. In the longitudinal care of INPH, the persistent parkinsonism after the shunt surgery and the favorable response to levodopa supported the clinical diagnosis of PD ( ). Krauss reported INPH and PD in 4 cases out of 118 adults with hydrocephalus ( ). Morishita has emphasized the role of the levodopa challenge for the diagnosis of PD in the setting of ventriculomegaly ( ). One may speculate whether this patient had a ventriculomegalic presentation of PD, given the partial response to the VP shunt, the good response to levodopa therapy, and the remarkable response to DBS ( ,  ). \n\nWe decided to operate on this patient, as DBS was considered the only option to improve his quality of life, although ventriculomegaly that is sufficient to preclude direct electrode passage to the surgical target may be a contraindication to DBS. However, we did not find any absolute contraindication for this surgery, and we found that ventricle volume does not predict motor change following DBS ( ). Indirect targeting is based on standardized stereotactic atlas and on a formula\u2014derived method based on AC-PC landmarks. We believed that both indirect targeting and MER would allow us to localize GPi, although the AC-PC line was particularly long, a feature which had never been reported in DBS surgery. \n\nPlanning electrode trajectories to avoid sulci and the ventricles was our main precaution. Careful fusion between CT and MRI images and MER to identify the GPi were essential ( ). MER was a non-expendable test, but multiple recordings were avoided to reduce the surgical risk of ventricular involvement. \n\n\n## Concluding remarks \n  \nWe postulate this case is PD coexisting with INPH. We conclude that DBS should be considered for PD patients with motor complications when responsiveness to levodopa is demonstrated, even in the context of ventriculomegaly. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nCG design of the study, analysis and interpretation of the data, drafting and revising the manuscript for intellectual content.

Consequently, patients do not receive the best care, leading to unnecessary disability, and to mounting costs for society. The Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) proposes an unbiased approach to biomarker development with multiple biomarkers measured longitudinally. Our main aims are: (a) to perform a set of hypothesis-driven analyses on the comprehensive dataset, correlating established and novel biomarkers to the rate of disease progression and to treatment response; and (b) to create a widely accessible dataset for discovery of novel biomarkers and new targets for therapeutic interventions in Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n\n## Methods/design \n  \nThis is a prospective, longitudinal, single-center cohort study. The cohort will comprise 650 persons with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The inclusion criteria are purposely broad: age\u2009\u2265\u200918\u2009years; and disease duration \u22645\u2009years. Participants are followed for 2 years, with three annual assessments at the study center. Outcomes include a clinical assessment (including motor and neuro-psychological tests), collection of biospecimens (stool, whole blood, and cerebrospinal fluid), magnetic resonance imaging (both structural and functional), and ECG recordings (both 12-lead and Holter). Additionally, collection of physiological and environmental data in daily life over 2 years will be enabled through the Verily Study Watch. All data are stored with polymorphic encryptions and pseudonyms, to guarantee the participants\u2019 privacy on the one hand, and to enable data sharing on the other. The data and biospecimens will become available for scientists to address Parkinson\u2019s disease-related research questions. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe PPP has several distinguishing elements: all assessments are done in a single center; inclusion of \u201creal life\u201d subjects; deep and repeated multi-dimensional phenotyping; and continuous monitoring with a wearable device for 2 years. Also, the PPP is powered by privacy and security by design, allowing for data sharing with scientists worldwide respecting participants\u2019 privacy. The data are expected to open the way for important new insights, including identification of biomarkers to predict differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients. Our long-term aim is to improve existing treatments, develop new therapeutic approaches, and offer Parkinson\u2019s disease patients a more personalized disease management approach. \n\n\n## Trial registration \n  \nClinical Trials  . Registered December 6, 2017 (retrospectively registered). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent degenerative brain disease [ ]. PD will become even more prevalent in our aging society, with an expected pandemic rise and doubling of the current patient volume by the year 2040 [ ]. From a systems-biology perspective, PD is seen increasingly as an umbrella term for a group of underlying disorders that all exhibit unique genetic, biological, and molecular abnormalities, and that are likely to respond differentially to a given therapeutic approach [ ]. Although adhering to the concept of PD as a single disorder has been useful for the development of symptomatic treatments, it has hindered progress when applied to the development of new interventions that can decelerate or even arrest disease progression [ ]. Moreover, our understanding of the basic etiology, pathophysiology, phenotypic diversity, and progression of PD has stagnated, partly due to the limited patient diversity captured in study cohorts, and partly because patients were not studied in sufficient detail (i.e., limited set of outcomes, or brief follow-up periods). As a result, patients do not receive the best care they deserve, leading to unnecessary disability and to mounting costs for society. \n\nTo date, there are no reliable biomarkers that can help to predict the widely varying differences between patients in prognosis, rate of progression, time to development of important milestones (e.g., time to first fall, or time to onset of dementia), or treatment response. Cohort studies evaluating multiple outcomes simultaneously are needed to address the multi-dimensional nature of PD. Although several of such cohorts exist and have already shown their merits [ \u2013 ], they all have their limitations. These limitations relate to, e.g., the inclusion of a highly selective patient population (rather than a more real-life population), to the multi-center design (introducing variability in assessments and procedures across centers), the lack of detailed clinical and genotyping baseline and follow-up information, the lack of repeated and advanced neuro-imaging, and the absence of wearable sensors to support the follow-up period. \n\nThe Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) intends to build a cohort that has unique characteristics to overcome the limitations of previous studies. The project will focus on the inclusion of \u201creal world\u201d representative patients with PD, who will undergo extremely detailed phenotyping, including microbiome & inflammation, high-quality repeated neuroimaging with repeated MRI scans and fMRI. All assessments are performed at a single centre and optimal retention strategies will be applied. In addition, we seek to perform day-to-day patient monitoring with a multi-sensor wearable device that allows continuous real-time data collection in the free-living environment during a 2-year follow-up period using a state-of-the-art and convenient wearable device. The PPP aims to identify biomarkers that can assist in predicting differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients. The insights generated by the PPP will pave the way to improve existing treatments, to create new therapeutic approaches, and to develop a more precise and personalized disease management approach. Additionally, the PPP cohort applies unprecedented digital security standards, supporting data sharing with qualified researchers worldwide, allowing them to add their research capacity to further address the main aims of this study. \n\n\n## Methods/design \n  \n### Study design \n  \nThis is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving 650 persons with PD. During a 2-year follow-up period, participants will undergo three extensive annual assessments, and continuously wear a multi-sensor investigational research device (the Verily Study Watch). The 5-year study is being carried out in one academic hospital in the Netherlands (the Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen). Participants will be included between October 2017 and December 2019, or longer until the recruitment target of 650 participants is achieved. \n\nThroughout the study period, a panel of 20 Parkinson patients will advise the research team on aspects of the study. For example, during the preparation phase, the panel advised on the design of the study procedures, on recruitment materials, and on subject retention strategies. \n\n\n### Study population \n  \nParticipants are eligible for this study if they meet the following criteria:   \nParkinson\u2019s disease duration \u22645\u2009years, defined as time since the diagnosis made by a neurologist; \n  \n18\u2009years of age or older; \n  \nAble to read and understand Dutch; \n  \nWilling, competent, and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including follow-up schedules and biospecimen collections; and \n  \nProviding written informed consent. \n  \n\nPatients with co-morbidity are explicitly NOT excluded from participation. Candidates will only be excluded in the case of existing co-morbidities that are sufficiently severe so as to hamper the interpretation of parkinsonian disability. Other exclusion criteria include contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pregnancy or breastfeeding, and/or nickel allergy (as components of the Study Watch contain this metal). For the lumbar puncture additional contraindications are defined, i.e., being treated with an anticoagulant medication or clinical evidence of structural cerebral abnormalities. \n\nTo guarantee a balanced study cohort, a stratification inclusion model will be applied, by gender (men/women), age (21\u201345;46\u201355; 56\u201365; \u226566\u2009years) and disease duration (<\u20092\u00bd\u2009years; \u22652\u00bd\u2009years). Consequently, half of the cohort will have a disease duration of maximally 2\u00bd\u2009years at the moment of inclusion, which will also allow us to the impact of very early signals and markers on disease progression. \n\n\n### Recruitment and enrolment \n  \nIn the Netherlands, approximately 40,000 people are diagnosed with PD, with an incidence of 8,000 newly diagnosed patients annually. Recruitment strategies that have proven to be successful in past clinical trials will be adopted [ \u2013 ]. First of all, the Dutch national ParkinsonNet, an existing nationwide clinical infrastructure in the Netherlands with 3,200 specialized PD professionals, will bring the study to the attention of its members [ \u2013 ]. Next, healthcare providers working in university medical centers and community-based hospitals treating PD patients and the Dutch Parkinson Patient Association, representing over 8,000 Dutch Parkinson patients, will promote the study. Finally, various social media announcements and media appearances will be used to reach the target population. All of those interested in the study will be redirected to the study website ( ), where detailed information can be found, along with an application form. \n\nAfter application, participants receive at least two personal sessions with a dedicated trial assessor by phone to screen eligibility and provide further information. During these calls, prior to inclusion, the assessor verifies that the participant is competent, by discussing the participant\u2019s decision and reasoning. The assessor can decide to not include a potential participant because of limitations in cognitive status that would keep the person from providing informed consent. If the patient is willing and able to participate, (s)he is invited to return a signed informed consent form by mail to the study center and the date for the baseline visit is booked. Once informed consent is obtained, access to the medical records of the treating neurologist and general practitioner is requested to verify the diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and check whether or not patients are diagnosed with clear dementia in the eyes of the patient\u2019s own physician. Those participants without a confirmed diagnoses and/or presence of dementia, will not be included, despite initial consent. During the first study visit, prior to the assessments, the trial assessor reconfirms that the patient understands the consequences of participation. During the follow-up visits the assessor will verify the cognitive status of the participants in a similar manner. The informal caregiver can also signal a marked cognitive decline that would hamper the patient\u2019s inability to understand the implications of continued participation. Patients who are no longer able to provide a valid informed consent for participation will be excluded from further follow-up, but the data obtained until that moment will be kept in the central database. \n\n\n### Study procedures and assessments \n  \nParticipants visit the study site three times for data collection: an initial baseline visit and two annual follow-up visits. Data collection during each visit takes a full day and can be spread out over a 1.5-day period if desired by the patient. Prior to each visit, study participants will be offered a complimentary hotel stay, thereby reducing the need for patients living far away from the study center to travel long distances in the early morning. Patients arrive at the study site in the morning in a practically defined OFF state, i.e., at least 12\u2009h after having taken their last dopaminergic PD medication. \n\nDuring the three in-clinic visits, detailed clinimetrics with multiple standardized evaluations for motor, neuropsychological, and other PD-related assessments are performed, while wearing the Verily Study Watch (see Table\u00a0  for an overview). Some of the motor assessments are performed first in a clinically defined OFF state and repeated after the participant has taken the regular first morning dose of medication(s) and has subjectively reached a typical ON state. The medical examination and clinical assessments are videotaped with a static camera and/or recorded for audio signals, unless the subject declines. The video-recording are for local use only and will not be shared within the study. In addition, relevant biospecimens are collected, i.e., whole blood for plasma/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)/serum/DNA/RNA, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool for longitudinal genotypic and phenotypic assays. CSF will be collected only at baseline and after 2\u2009years and is the single optional element of the study protocol. Local anaesthesia will be provided to minimize patient burden and atraumatic needles will be used. Moreover, using advanced MRI, at baseline and after two years, indices of in vivo brain structure and function are obtained, using an extension of the UK Biobank protocol [ ,  ]. The PPP MRI protocol captures structural MRI (T1 and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)), resting functional MRI (fMRI), and two task-related fMRI studies. The tasks probe both primary brain dysfunction, i.e. basal ganglia dysfunction, as well as cerebral compensatory activity. An additional surface electromyography is performed during MRI scanning to monitor tremor, so artifacts can be removed [ ]. Finally, to assess autonomic dysfunction, study subjects wear a Holter monitor during each in-clinic visit (except while being in the MRI scanner), and a 12-lead ECG is performed while the subject is supine. Blood pressure is measured in both supine and standing positions, from which the presence of orthostatic hypotension will be assessed.   \nOverview of included study measures and scales in the Personalized Parkinson Project \n  \n BDI   Beck Depression Inventory,   CSF   Cerebro-Spinal Fluid,   CSI   Caregiver Strain Index,   DNA   Deoxyribonucleic acid,   DTI   Diffusion Tensor Imaging,   ECG   electrocardiogram,   EDA   electrodermal activity,   EDTA   Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acid,   FLAIR   Fluid Attenuation Inversion recovery,   H&Y   Hoehn & Yahr,   IMU   Inertial Measurement Unit,   MDS-UPDRS-I/II/III/IV   Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale, non-motor experiences of daily living section (I), motor experiences of daily living section (II), motor examination section (III), and motor complications section (IV),   MMSE   Mini Mental State Examination, MoCa Montreal Cognitive Assessment,   MRI   Magnetic Resonance Imaging,   PASE   Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly,   PAX genes   Paired box genes,   PBMC   Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell,   PDQ-39   39-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire,   PPG   photoplethysmograph,   QSM   Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping,   QUIP-RS   Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson\u2019s Disease-Rating Scale,   RBD   Rapid eye movement sleep Behaviour Disorder,   RNA   Ribonucleic Acid,   SCOPA-aut   SCales for Outcomes in PArkinson\u2019s disease, autonomic function section,   SCOPA-sleep   SCales for Outcomes in PArkinson\u2019s disease, sleep section,   SF-12   12-item Short Form,   STAI   State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults,   TUG   Timed Up and Go test \n\nMedical examinations & clinical assessments will be videotaped unless a subject declines;  \u00a0\u00b1\u200960\u2009days;   within 4\u2009weeks after each in-clinic visit \n  \n\nAfter each visit participants complete a set of validated questionnaires at home, including questionnaires about medication use, quality of life, lifestyle, neuropsychological symptoms, autonomic symptoms, sleep, and vision, among others [ \u2013 ]. These questionnaires are completed within 4\u2009weeks after each visit, via an online survey module. \n\nFinally, a copy of the medical record of the participant\u2019s primary care physician is requested. This provides a rich information source of known and unknown markers of disease progression. \n\nParticipants are asked to wear the Verily Study Watch preferably 24/7, except during charging, for 2 years. During the baseline visit, the trial assessor discusses the importance of ambulatory monitoring with the subject and explains and demonstrates the use of the Study Watch. Moreover, a paper-based user manual is made available to each participant. The Verily Study Watch is an investigational, non-CE marked, multi-sensor wearable device designed to extend data collection for clinical studies beyond trial sites and into the free-living environment. For its use in the Personalized Parkinson Project approval is obtained by the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate. The device enables the collection of physiological and environmental data about acceleration/orientation, pulse rate, electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram (ECG), barometric pressure, relative humidity, environmental temperature, and ambient light level. The Verily Study Watch is intended for passive data collection only, with minimal information communicated to the user via the device (Fig.\u00a0 ). Data from the Verily Study Watch are encrypted and sent securely to the Verily cloud using a USB syncing/charging cradle and wireless connectivity bridge (the Verily Study Hub). The Study Watch has been deployed in several studies, mainly in the United States, including the Baseline Health Study [ ] and the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) [ ].   \nThe Verily Study Watch (an Investigational Device), along with syncing/charging cradle and Study Hub.

In addition to the study helpdesk, assigning a personal trial assessor to each participant during the entire study period is an important retention strategy. Participants are kept informed about the study with newsletters and participant events. In addition, the study website will be used for regular recruitment updates, combined with an extensive information package on topics that are found to be relevant for people with PD. The topics will be selected by the participants themselves. \n\n\n### Quality management \n  \nAll study procedures are being performed at a single centre, the Radboud university medical center. The study assessors were extensively trained and certified for the various elements of the protocol, before enrollment of the first study subject. Written standardized operating procedures (SOPs) were developed, detailing all data collection and study procedures. At least once a month, the study team discusses unexpected situations and problems encountered with execution of the study protocol. Frequent monitoring of the data quality ensures a timely identification of both systematic and incidental deviations. On a monthly basis an independent study monitor checks key elements of the study, e.g., inclusion rates, informed consents, data entry, protocol deviations, and (serious) adverse event reporting. If quality control issues emerge, the study protocol and SOPs will be amended and trial assessors will be retrained. \n\n\n### Data management and protection to subject privacy \n  \n#### Data protection \n  \nFor the PPP study, a Polymorphic Encryption and Pseudonymization (PEP) infrastructure was developed and is used to protect the data and the privacy of the participants [ ]. For each participant, this method generates unique pseudonyms for the different participating research groups. The PEP was created to deal with the rigidity of the traditional encryption/decryption process by using polymorphic encryption right after collection and before storage. In that manner, there is no need to a priori fix in the encryption key for the data. The PEP system allows different researchers to have access to the entire dataset or only a subset of the dataset with a specific decryption key. In addition, the polymorphic encryption method avoids the combination of different datasets by different decryption key-holders, since each key only decrypts that subset of the data. Due to its additional security, the PEP is an ideal approach to manage sensitive personal data with reduced risk of a participant\u2019s privacy being violated. \n\n\n#### Data handling and storage \n  \nAn electronic data capture and management system, Castor ( ), is used for the collection of most study data. This is a GCP-certified data management system with servers in accordance with the NEN7510 norm for information security in healthcare. All medical examinations and clinical assessment data are entered directly into Castor and stored in a pseudonymized manner. Similarly, Castor is used by subjects to complete the online questionnaires as part of the annual assessment. Holter ECG and 12-lead ECG data are also stored directly into Castor. MRI data is collected and stored at the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroscience (DCCN), following their data management procedures: after data collection a backup is stored locally on the DCCN data servers; a copy is transferred to PEP, based on a PEP-generated pseudonym. Participating researchers can access data only via PEP. For the Verily Study Watch data, Verily will first preprocess the data and subsequently upload it to PEP. Verily only knows the device identifiers, but does not know the study participants. \n\nAll biospecimens are biobanked at the Radboud Biobank (Nijmegen, the Netherlands) [ ], with their sample tracking system, sample processing system operation procedures, and standardized sample storage conditions being employed. In addition to Radboud\u2019s laboratory capabilities, some sample processing will be performed by Verily Life Sciences. Verily has an on-site biobank as well as laboratories for molecular biology, chemistry, immunology, and systems biology including a population scale genomics facility. Verily\u2019s laboratories use a laboratory information system for sample tracking, and all staff are trained on standard operation procedures for sample biobanking and processing. PEP pseudonyms for all samples have been added to both biobanks\u2019 sample tracking systems. \n\n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of disease progression and, ultimately, to evaluate treatment response with respect to the presence of both established and potential biomarkers. More specifically, we will address two objectives in the short term:   \nThe individual associations between potential biomarkers and disease progression in Parkinson\u2019s disease, with progression being expressed in terms of rate of decline in two key outcome domains of the disease, i.e., motor functioning and cognitive functioning. \n  \nThe prediction of disease progression after 1\u2009year and 2\u2009years on each of the two outcome domains. \n  \n\nMotor functioning will be determined using the score from the motor section (part III) of the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [ ], measured in the OFF state. Cognitive functioning will be determined using the score from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), a scale for global cognitive abilities that is validated for use in Parkinson\u2019s disease [ ]. \n\nFor each of the two outcomes, the prediction will be made for absolute change scores (as a continuous measure) and clinically important change scores or clinically important threshold (as a dichotomous measure). For motor functioning, the dichotomous measure is a change of at least 5.5 [ ,  ]. For cognitive functioning, the dichotomous measure is a follow-up score below 23.5 [ ]. Both will be calculated over the first year of follow-up, as a measure for short-term disease progression (hence with direct clinical relevance for near-term treatment decisions), and over 2 years of follow-up, as a measure for mid-term prognosis. \n\nThe association between a potential biomarker and the change in the PD outcome (objective 1) will be evaluated with a multivariable linear model, adjusted for age and disease duration. For objective 2, a variety of different model building methods (e.g., forward stepwise logistic regression or lasso penalized regression methods) will be considered in the training set such that up to three candidate models may be assessed in the second half of the sample [ ]. The training and testing set will be randomly selected from the entire sample. One of these models will be designated as primary for the formal assessment of objective 2 before the outcomes in the test set are unblinded. If the number of events using the split sample approach is insufficient to develop a strong model in the first half sample, cross-validation on the full sample will be considered as an alternative. For instance, as a rule of thumb, there should be no more than 1 predictor variable for every 10 events. Thus, before the data are analyzed, the list of variables to be considered may need to be trimmed. \n\nIf the selected predictors are available in the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset [ ], this dataset will be used for external model validation. If this is not possible, at least internal validation will be performed using the test set and, if the model is refit on the full data, bootstrapping. \n\nAdditional examples of a priori hypotheses that we aim to address are, e.g.,:   \nActivity levels extracted from the Verily Study Watch in the weeks preceding a clinic visit can predict Total and Part III scores on the MDS-UPDRS. \n  \nPersons with higher levels of disease burden (including motor, affective, and cognitive symptoms) will show decreased heart rate variability when compared to persons with lower levels of disease burden. \n  \nNeurocognitive testing scores predict the development of mild cognitive impairment [ ,  ]. \n  \nClinical motor progression in PD is the net outcome of the shifting balance between parietal hyperactivity (compensation) and basal ganglia hypoactivity (primary pathophysiology). \n  \n\n#### Sample size considerations \n  \nFor the first objective, we will test the association between potential biomarkers and the deterioration of PD on each of the two outcome domains. In this test, both the dependent and independent variables are continuous measures. In order to adjust for multiple testing issues (up to 55 biomarkers and two outcome measures) we will use a two-sided significance level of 0.05/(2\u2009\u00d7\u200955), i.e., 0.00045 instead of 0.05. In order to detect an association with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.2 with a power of 90%, 565 patients are needed. Taking into account an attrition rate of 10% and missing data for approximately 3% of patients, we aim to include 650 patients in total. If additional novel biomarkers are selected for model consideration prior to the initiation of analysis, power of 80% will be retained with 100 or fewer biomarkers considered. \n\nFor the second objective we will use the dichotomous outcomes to estimate the required sample size. We will use a split sample approach to develop the model in the first half of the dataset and test it on the second half of the data. Therefore, if there are a total of 565 patients evaluable, as dictated by the power calculation for the first objective, there will be 282 patients available to assess the accuracy of the model in the test set. It is desirable to demonstrate that the accuracy is greater than 70%, i.e., the probability that the model correctly predicts whether the patient did or did not have an event using a pre-specified threshold, is larger than 70%. We will have 80% power to demonstrate that the model is more accurate than 70% if the true accuracy is 77% or higher. If sensitivity or specificity at a single cut point is lower than desired for clinical utility, power may be improved by assessing the AUC (area under the ROC curve) rather than the accuracy at a single threshold. \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe key purpose of the Personalized Parkinson Project is to contribute to the understanding of the differences in etiology, pathophysiology, phenotypic diversity, and disease progression among individual PD patients. Although previous cohort studies have largely contributed to elucidate the differences between PD patients and healthy control subjects [ ,  \u2013 ], we remain unable to understand the basis for the large diversity of phenotypes and variability in progression rates among PD patients. It remains unclear why some PD patients stay functional and independent long into the disease, while others progress to significant motor and/or cognitive impairment and are unable to live unassisted relatively early in the course of the disease. The 2-year follow-up captures inter-individual differences in the speed of disease progression on numerous clinically relevant outcomes, including motor- and non-motor symptoms and endpoints that are relevant in the earlier phases of the disease, such as the ability to work. \n\nThe PPP has several unique elements: an unbiased approach to patient selection, with purposely broad inclusion criteria (also allowing for presence of co-morbid conditions); repeated clinical, molecular, and imaging data collection performed at a single center; and multi-dimensional analysis to uncover novel biomarkers of PD. A broad biomarker definition will be applied, in line with the recently proposed modular set of biomarker assessments [ ]. In addition, participants will be followed for 2\u2009years using a wearable multi-sensor device, which creates the opportunity to continuously monitor aggregated features (e.g., daily and weekly activity level, mean daily pulse rate and its variability, average sleep efficiency per day) to characterize each participant over time. The very liberal inclusion criteria, where participants with co-morbidities are encouraged to join, allow us to collect data from \u201creal-life\u201d patients and explore how co-morbidities impair the overall expression of PD. Moreover, although we aim for a unique dataset, to the extent possible we have harmonized data collection with previously performed cohort studies including the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative [ ], Luxembourg Parkinson\u2019s Study [ ] and the Oxford Parkinson Discovery Cohort [ ]. In this manner we also support initiatives such as the Critical Path for Parkinson\u2019s Consortium (CPP), that aim to create integrated unified databases, thus allowing to increase sample sizes or add control populations and further enhance research. \n\nFurthermore, the PPP cohort will contribute data managed through an unprecedented digital security system, which will allow sharing of data with researchers worldwide with maintenance of participants\u2019 privacy. The digital security system is based on a multi-point, privacy-by-design strategy: (a) participants provide informed consent, also for the important element of data sharing; (b) signed contractual agreements with researchers are in place to ensure that no attempts towards de-identification or commercialization of the raw data will be attempted; (c) governance policies restrain access to the data to only qualified researchers; (d) an innovative pseudonymization and encryption process is applied [ ]; and (e) a protected research environment is used to analyze the data. \n\nLastly, powered by Verily\u2019s analytics capabilities, the PPP will allow us to address research questions of great scientific and clinical value to improve our understanding of PD pathology and variation between patients in terms of disease progression, therapy response (both efficacy and tolerance), and survival. Though we will not be able to adjust for normal age-related changes due to the lack of a matched control group, the PPP data will help to identify new biomarkers to predict differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients, an important step to improving existing treatments, developing new therapeutic approaches, and providing PD patients with a more precise and personalized disease management approach. Finally, this cohort will serve as a source of data for qualified researchers worldwide, allowing them to use their research capacity to further address and enhance the main aims of this study. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6636112, "text_md5": "212fc3bb307aca75618c23b3bd5d3866", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 285], "journal": [286, 296], "publication_year": [298, 302], "title": [313, 432], "keywords": [446, 528], "abstract": [541, 3213], "body": [3222, 33280]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 31315608, "doi": "10.1186/s12883-019-1394-3", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6636112", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6636112"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6636112\">6636112</a>", "list_title": "PMC6636112  The Personalized Parkinson Project: examining disease progression through broad biomarkers in early Parkinson\u2019s disease"}

Indeed, gastrointestinal symptoms can occur at all stages of this neurodegenerative disease and in up to a third of cases, their onset can precede the involvement of the central nervous system. Recent data suggest that enteric glial cells (EGCs) may play a major role in PD-related gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as in the development and progression of the central disease. In addition to their trophic and structural functions, EGCs are crucial for the homeostatic control of a wide range of gastrointestinal activities. The main purpose of this review was to provide a detailed overview of the role of EGCs in intestinal PD-associated alterations, with particular regard for their participation in digestive and central inflammation as well as the dynamic interactions between glial cells and intestinal epithelial barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that several pathological intestinal conditions, associated with an impairment of barrier permeability, may trigger dysfunctions of EGCs and their shift towards a proinflammatory phenotype. The reactive gliosis is likely responsible for PD-related neuroinflammation and the associated pathological changes in the ENS. Thus, ameliorating the efficiency of mucosal barrier, as well as avoiding IEB disruption and the related reactive gliosis, might theoretically prevent the onset of PD or, at least, counteract its progression. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in the world, with an incidence rising almost exponentially with age. This has significant public health implications, since it is estimated that the number of people with PD will grow significantly by 2030 as a consequence of increased life expectancy [ ]. \n\nPD is characterized by a significant dopaminergic neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for the occurrence of typical motor symptoms [ , ]. In addition, PD patients are characterized by the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) motor dysfunctions, which are classically considered as secondary conditions comprised in the wide spectrum of non-motor symptoms associated with PD. However, over recent years, several lines of evidence have lent support to the hypothesis that PD could be considered a gut-originated disease [ ]. Indeed, the onset of GI symptoms can precede the involvement of central nervous system (CNS) in up to 30% of PD patients, and bowel dysfunctions are among the most severe non-motor symptoms of the disease [ ]. As a consequence, the hypothesis of a digestive origin of PD has taken shape and paved the way to several studies focused on the evaluation of bowel alterations associated with PD [ , , , ]. \n\nAccumulating evidence, yielded by studies of the gut to unravel PD pre-symptomatic progression, sustains a very intriguing theory on the gut alterations that may anticipate and predict the onset of PD symptoms, and may help to identify innovative anti-PD therapeutic interventions. In this setting, it has been proposed that enteric glial cells (EGCs) could take a significant part in PD-related GI dysfunctions, as well as in the induction and progression of the CNS disease. In this review, we discuss recent research data pointing out the involvement of enteric glia in the pathophysiology of bowel alterations associated with PD, as a possible starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting these cells. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \nPubMed was used as the database to establish and identify the literature. No date restriction was put on the search, even though articles from the last five years were preferred. The literature search was carried out using different combinations of keywords: \u201cParkinson Disease\u201d AND (Gut OR EGC OR IEB OR \u03b1-syn). Articles selected from PubMed were reviewed first by title, then abstract, and finally, the full article. \n\n\n## 3. The Enteric Glial Cells \n  \nThe enteric nervous system (ENS) includes a large population of EGCs, which are thought to be the digestive equivalent of brain astrocytes [ ]. EGCs are historically considered to contribute mainly to the structural and trophic protection of enteric neurons [ ]. However, in addition to these traditional tasks, EGCs have been found to play crucial roles in the homeostatic control of a broad variety of GI functions, including motility, synaptic transmission, mucosal barrier integrity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection, via dynamic interplays with neurons, epithelial, and immune cells [ , ]. \n\nIn mice, similarly for enteric neurons, EGCs are generated from proliferating neural crest-derived cells that colonize the embryonic intestine from day 9 to 13.5 [ , ]. Shortly after their birth, EGCs migrate from the myenteric plexus and submucous plexus into the lamina propria to colonize the mucosal layer [ ]. \n\nTypically, EGCs can be classified into four subgroups, based on their structure and location within the digestive tract [ ]. Thus, type I or \u201cprotoplasmic\u201d glial cells are star-shaped cells located in the ganglia; type II or \u201cfibrous\u201d cells are found in the interganglionic connectives, lining the nerves; type III or \u201cmucosal\u201d and type IV or \u201cintramuscular\u201d EGCs are located in their respective site within the gut wall [ ] ( ). \n\nAlong with differences in location and morphology, mature EGCs express a variety of molecular markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [ ], S100\u03b2 [ ], connexin-43 (Cx43) [ ], proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) [ ], and vimentin [ ]. These markers are not pan-expressed, as the expression of GFAP in the adult stage is fleeting, but Sox10 and PLP1 label the large majority of EGCs. These complex patterns of protein expression are likely to reflect the functional diversity and plasticity of different EGC types [ ]. \n\nEnteric glial cell populations and their respective morpho-functional properties often differ significantly according to sex, age, and species [ , , ]. This is a critical aspect when comparing observations from different studies and interpolating data from animal and human studies. For instance, in the rodent (guinea pig) intestine, the glia-to-neuron ratio is approximately seven-fold less than in the human digestive tract [ ]. Furthermore, EGCs may display variability in the expression of specific receptor subtypes among different species or gut regions [ , , ]. Many signal pathways appear well maintained, but how close human and murine enteric glia really are remains unclear. \n\nEGCs play a significant part in the modulation of gut functions by regulating motility and influencing both neural networks and intestinal epithelium [ , , ]. Like astrocytes, EGCs are excitable cells and their excitability is mediated mainly by cytosolic calcium (Ca ) signals [ , ], triggered by neurotransmitters, such as serotonin or acetylcholine, through synaptic interactions [ , ] ( ). McClain and colleagues showed that Ca  signals in EGCs regulate the opening of glial Cx43 hemichannels, and that EGC-specific ablation of the Cx43 gene decreases intestinal smooth muscle contractions under both ex vivo and in vivo recording [ ]. Glial Ca  dynamics are extremely important for normal intestinal physiology and in any circumstance, modifications that affect EGCs\u2019 signaling pathways, such as variations in their number or Ca  signaling, could play a major role in GI motor disorders [ , ]. \n\n\n## 4. Role of Enteric Glia in Intestinal and CNS Inflammation \n  \nOver the past years, several studies have shown that the pathophysiology of GI diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic constipation, can significantly involve EGCs [ , , ]. \n\nA number of investigations have shown that EGCs express the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and can respond to harmful inputs, mostly through toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4, thus actively controlling the neuro\u2013immune axis and protecting the host against gut pathogens [ ] ( ). \n\nThis glial response under pathological conditions, known as \u201creactive gliosis\u201d, usually triggers a broad spectrum of alterations, including TLRs activation [ , ], altered expression and release of several glia-related proteins and enzymes, such as GFAP, S100B, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and matrix metallopeptidases [ ], and the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF\u03baB/p38MAPK and JAK/STAT [ ]. Activated EGCs display an altered sensitivity to purinergic agonists and respond to cell threats through the release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, growth factors, including GDNF, and other immunomodulatory signals, such as nitric oxide (NO) and S100B [ , , ], all contributing to the development of pro-inflammatory conditions, which could negatively affect the intestinal barrier integrity and activate neuronal death [ ] ( ). Therefore, it appears that the enteric glia is actively involved in intestinal inflammatory responses, as it is now clear that EGCs hold the ability of modulating immune functions, secreting and responding directly to inflammatory mediators [ ]. \n\nAs anticipated above, EGCs react to the exposure to harmful stimuli-expressing TLRs and other co-stimulatory T cell molecules, including MHC-II [ ]. It is not clear whether these signaling mechanisms are involved in other facets of reactive gliosis, outside of the inflamed bowel. However, as the most prevalent cell population in the ENS, EGCs are the most likely candidates to operate as antigen-presenting cells in the intestinal neuroimmune system. Indeed, they are capable of presenting antigens to both innate and adaptive immune cells located in the digestive tract [ ] ( ). Peripheral inflammation and proliferation of CD  T cells could then spread towards extradigestive sites. \n\nSince CD  T cells can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, they could give rise to central inflammatory responses. In this regard, the extensive recruitment of pro-inflammatory molecules and activated CD  T cells from the periphery is a common feature of CNS neurodegenerative disorders [ ]. Moreover, the shift in the differentiation and number of CD  T-derived cell subtypes to proinflammatory phenotypes, such as Th1 and Th17, as well as the inhibition of Treg and Th2 anti-inflammatory activity, have been highlighted as important processes under such pathological conditions [ ] ( ). This pathological activation of CD  T cells has been associated with the induction of neuroinflammatory response and dysregulation, which represents a key event in the progressive development of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [ , ] ( ). \n\nOverall, an important challenge for future work will be to evaluate how to reduce the detrimental consequences of intestinal reactive gliosis without compromising the physiological functions of EGCs. This can be daunting, considering that glial mediators, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and NO, play essential roles in both GI physiology [ , ] and pathophysiology [ , ]. Therefore, targeting of the different signaling pathways involved in the physiological or pathological activities of the glia might allow the downregulation of pathological responses without interfering with GI physiology. \n\n\n## 5. The Crosstalk between EGCs, Intestinal Epithelial Barrier and Gut Microbiota \n  \nThe intestinal epithelium forms a controlled barrier that keeps the host separate from the contents of the bowel lumen, thus avoiding the passage of noxious substances, while allowing the absorption of nutrients [ ]. An increasing body of evidence strongly supports the concept that the enteric glia is an effective regulator of physiological processes in the intestinal mucosa [ ]. Indeed, molecular factors secreted by mucosal EGCs seem to be involved in the differentiation of epithelial cells and regulation of IEB homeostasis [ ] ( ). \n\nFor instance, mice with targeted enteric glia ablation display a drastic alteration of the epithelial barrier integrity [ ]. In vitro studies have identified a variety of enteric glial-derived molecular factors that influence the activity of the gut mucosal barrier through specific actions on epithelial cells [ , ]. Among the different EGC mediators, GDNF seems to play a central role in the maintenance of mucosal integrity. Its protective activity is explicated by both inhibiting EGC apoptosis and reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ , ] ( ). Notably, in patients with functional dyspepsia, GDNF seems to be able to sustain the reconstitution and maturation of the epithelial barrier during moderate inflammation [ ]. This action is closely related with the observation that EGCs display structural modifications in duodenal biopsies of patients with dyspepsia, characterized by overexpression of the protein S100B [ ]. GDNF levels are increased in models of in vivo intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, perhaps as a defense mechanism. Indeed, under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation, GDNF was able to prevent epithelial barrier disruption [ ]. Several studies indicate that EGC-derived GDNF improved the tight junctions in intestinal epithelial cells [ , ] ( ). However, it is worth noting that EGCs are not the primary source of GDNF, as neurons and epithelial cells also produce and release this mediator [ ]. \n\nStudies of human biopsies and primary cultured EGCs have shown that these cells express iNOS, thus having the ability of producing and releasing NO [ , ]. In human EGCs, this capability is enhanced by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [ ], and pathogens [ ] ( ). Notably, S100B appears to exert a prominent role during EGC activation, and its overexpression and release has been correlated with NO hyperproduction during bowel inflammation [ , ]. Some studies have shown that a large proportion of NO release in gut inflammation may come from EGCs, and that EGC-derived NO correlates specifically with the integrity of the epithelial barrier [ , ] ( ). Indeed, in an in vitro model of co-culture of EGCs with epithelial cells, it has been shown that, in the presence of LPS, glial NO acts on intestinal epithelial cell monolayers, increasing their permeability [ ]. In addition, MacEachern et al. found that in a mouse model of colitis, EGC activation influences the mucosal transport of electrogenic ions, which results in an impaired IEB function, and that EGC-derived iNOS is directly responsible for this action ( ). Likewise, the inhibition of EGCs with fluoroacetate, a glial cell metabolic toxin, and the prevention of NO production were able to restore the enteric barrier function in colitis [ ]. \n\nRecently, unexpected findings have been made in contrast with the current theory that EGCs exert protecting actions on the enteric barrier [ ]. For instance, under physiological conditions, the blockade of glial functions with fluoroacetate does not seem to affect the barrier functions [ ]. Rao et al. observed that selectively ablating PLP-1 expressing glial cells did not trigger IEB disruption and epithelial alterations, and suggested that the mechanism by which the enteric glia compromises the IEB involves enteric inflammation and not the glial disruption itself [ ]. Moreover, Grubi\u0161i\u0107 and Gulbransen found that Cx43 ablation in enteric glia did not modulate the IEB functions [ ]. However, it should be noted that many of these conflicting findings might be explained in light of the different approaches used to generate the results, (i.e., in vitro or in vivo), and the different methods employed to ablate EGCs. \n\nOne very interesting feature of EGCs is their ability to establish bidirectional interactions with the gut microbiota in the intestinal mucosa [ ] ( ). At present, it is not clear how EGCs specifically affect the microbiota. However, recent evidence suggests that the gut bacteria have a significant impact on mucosal glial growth. Kabouridis et al. [ ] showed that the mucosal glia is continuously renewed by precursor cells and that such turnover does not take place in germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice. These findings suggest that stimuli from gut microbiota are crucial for facilitating glia migration from the enteric plexuses to the mucosa. During this process, even though the precise mechanisms remain still to be clarified, interactions of EGCs with both the microbiota and the immune system are required [ ]. Hypothetically, it is possible that bacterial and viral components can affect actively the enteric glia through direct interactions with glial TLRs [ ] ( ). This would imply that glia is frequently exposed to bacterial/viral products in the mucosa, but it remains unknown to what extent these interactions occur under physiological conditions. Perhaps, a more plausible explanation is that the glia can be partially affected by the microbiota via interactions with the intestinal epithelium [ ] and mucosal immune cells [ ]. In this regard, neuroimmune interactions regulated by the microbiota have been reported already [ ]. In this specific situation, through breaching the damaged epithelial layer, the luminal microbiota may act as a catalyst for neuroinflammation within the ENS. Remarkably, changes in intestinal microbiota composition and IEB disruption are closely correlated, and have been identified as main factors not only in bowel inflammation, but also in the pathogenesis of PD ( ). This strong relationship is consistent with findings of altered gut microbiota composition in PD patients [ ] and the occurrence of motor disorders in \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn)-overexpressing mice colonized with microbiota taken from PD patients [ ]. Keshavarzian et al. [ ] found that \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, such as Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia, were considerably reduced in the stool of PD patients, as well as Faecalibacterium in the mucosa, while \u201cproinflammatory\u201d Ralstonia were considerably more common in their bowel mucosa. In addition, about 25% of PD patients display an abnormal growth of small intestinal bacteria, which has been correlated directly to PD development [ ]. While specific bacterial species have not yet been implicated in the development of PD, it has been reported that modifications of the intestinal microbiota can trigger an imbalance of the gut\u2013brain axis through immunological priming of EGCs [ ]. In support of these assumptions, rotenone was found to be partly effective in inducing PD in TLR-4 knockout mice, thus suggesting that an attenuated PD symptomatology depends on an impairment of EGC-mediated immune response [ ]. \n\nHaving an overall look at this body of knowledge, it is fair to conclude that a number of pathological intestinal conditions, associated with an impairment of barrier permeability, may trigger dysfunctions of EGCs and their shift towards a proinflammatory phenotype. Therefore, ameliorating the efficiency of mucosal barrier, as well as avoiding IEB disruption and the related reactive gliosis, might theoretically prevent the onset of PD or, at least, counteract its progression. However, for the time being, these are very thrilling observations that raise many questions about the microbiota\u2013glial dynamics in gut physiology and pathophysiology. \n\n\n## 6. Enteric \u03b1-Synuclein Accumulation in PD \n  \nIn the CNS, the distinctive pathological feature of PD is the presence of insoluble deposits of misfolded \u03b1-syn in the basal ganglia, specifically in the substantia nigra. These protein deposits are commonly designated as Lewy bodies [ ]. Interestingly, various clinical reports have revealed the presence of Lewy bodies and neurites also in the ENS of almost every investigated PD patient [ , ]. Several studies have shown that \u03b1-syn accumulation occurs in the ENS over the course of the pre-motor phase of the disease, thus greatly emphasizing the putative extra-CNS roots of this neurodegenerative disorder, and arguing strongly against the idea of PD as a central illness [ , ]. \n\nIn animal models, the presence of misfolded \u03b1-syn in the ENS is associated with the occurrence of GI disturbances and an increased expression of proteins linked to PD, such as leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2) [ ] ( ). \n\nA recent study showed that animals with experimental PD induced by systemic administration of LPS displayed an impairment of intestinal permeability in the initial stages of the disorder, prior to \u03b1-syn deposition in the ENS and the onset of central nigrostriatal neurodegeneration [ ]. Moreover, Yang et al. [ ] found the presence of intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by a rise in the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, enteric \u03b1-syn aggregation, and colonic inflammation in rodents with rotenone-induced PD. Of note, such alterations occurred prior to the onset of motor dysfunctions, central neurodegeneration, and appearance of \u03b1-syn inclusions in the CNS. In this setting, the alterations of the enteric bacteria-immune network might lead to a derangement of the gut\u2013brain axis, resulting in a prionic migration of misfolded \u03b1-syn from the enteric compartment to CNS [ ]. This suggest that, perhaps, the ENS could act as an entrance doorway to pathogens, contributing to the digestive pathogenesis of PD. In this regard, the vagus nerve appears to be involved in this process. Indeed, it has been observed that the effect of rotenone on PD-like development was inhibited by hemivagotomy [ ]. Moreover, in a recent paper, Kim and colleagues demonstrated that \u03b1-syn fibrils, injected in the duodenal and pyloric muscular layer, can spread to the CNS, while a truncal vagotomy prevented the central \u03b1-synucleinopathy [ ]. Additionally, it has been observed that patients with a truncal vagotomy had a lower risk of developing PD [ , ]. \n\nThe typical motor manifestations of PD occur as a consequence of the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, associated with the formation of Lewy bodies. In this regard, a large body of research has indicated also the occurrence of an early onset of Lewy pathology, in tandem with enteric glial dysfunction, in the colon of PD patients [ ]. Therefore, the alterations of glial functions, in concomitance with an early accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-syn, may lead to changes in enteric neuronal activity and induction of intestinal inflammation, as well as dysfunctions of bowel motility, typically observed in PD patients ( ). These concepts are in keeping with the clinical observation that the bowel and non-motor signs of PD appear many years earlier than the onset of motor impairment [ ]. However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between enteric \u03b1-syn and glial cells have not been clearly established and need to be investigated further. \n\n\n## 7. EGCs in the Pathophysiology of PD \n  \nThe increasing awareness of the essential role of EGCs in the regulation of GI physiology prompted the researchers to assess the putative impairments of this cell population in PD. A first important step has been to evaluate variations of the expression rates of the three widely known enteric glial markers, GFAP, S100\u03b2, and Sox-10. In this regard, Devos and colleagues first demonstrated that the expression levels of GFAP and Sox-10, but not S100\u03b2, were increased in colonic biopsies from PD patients [ ]. Moreover, the expression of GFAP and Sox-10 were closely associated with increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [ , ] ( ). \n\nGFAP is a phosphoprotein that needs to be phosphorylated in its amino-terminus to regulate its self-assembly, and plays a major role in cytoskeleton formation [ ]. Given that cytoskeleton stabilization is important for normal astrocyte activity, alterations in the phosphorylation of GFAP might be critically involved in CNS disorders. Consistently with this hypothesis, alterations of central GFAP phosphorylation have been documented in both preclinical and clinical studies. Indeed, an increase in the phosphorylation of serine 13 residue has been reported both in a pig model of brain hypoxia [ ] and the brain of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia [ , ]. On the other hand, there is no evidence of altered GFAP phosphorylation in PD, and this point needs to be investigated. \n\nOn these bases, despite the lack of evidence in PD, it is conceivable that the occurrence of an impairment of GFAP phosphorylation might take place also in the GI tract. Consistently with this hypothesis, Clairembault et al. reported a hypophosphorylation in the serine 13 of GFAP in colonic biopsies from PD patients [ ]. Intriguingly, these glial modifications appear to be unique to PD, since no changes in the expression of GFAP phosphorylation were found when examining colonic biopsies from patients with other neurodegenerative disorders [ ]. Based on these findings, the different pattern of glial response in PD could probably depend on the different pathophysiological features of PD, as compared with other neurodegenerative disorders ( ). Nevertheless, these observations suggest that reactive gliosis is strongly predictive of the GFAP changes found in the colon of PD patients [ ]. Overall, these findings are consistent with the view that PD is not limited to the CNS, but is actually a generalized neuronal disease that affects peripheral autonomic networks, particularly the ENS, thus strengthening the theory that during PD, a glial reaction occurs in the GI tract [ ]. In addition, the increase in enteric glial-related pro-inflammatory markers in the colon of PD patients, during the earliest stages of the disease, strongly suggests that an initial glial response takes place at the onset of this pathological condition [ ] ( ). Of note, glial marker levels are inversely proportional to the course of the disease, thus indicating that enteric glial activity is elevated at the beginning, while declining over time [ ]. In particular, it is likely that enteric glial activity can be strong at the disease initiation, when triggered cells release their cytokines, while declining over the late phases of the disease, as observed previously with microglial activation in the brain [ ]. \n\nAs far as the involvement of EGCs in central neurodegeneration is concerned, early reactive enteric gliosis might promote a local neuroinflammation that could then ascend to CNS through glial Cx43 hemichannels, and likely via vagal nerve fibers. Glial Cx43 expression in the gap junctions depends on the concentration of intracellular Ca  and is strongly regulated by inflammation. For example, in the HIV-1 Tat-induced diarrhea model, an overexpression of Cx43 in S100B-positive cells has been shown, with a propagation of this expression pattern from the intestinal submucosal plexus to the frontal cortex, through the spinal cord, suggesting that the connection between EGCs and central astrocytes involves such glial proteins [ ]. In this model, a late onset of cognitive function disorder was observed as a result of such mechanisms [ ]. \n\nThe gut\u2013brain axis is a bidirectional signaling pathway, through which, on the one hand, the gut is able to interact with the brain, and on the other hand, CNS alterations and neurodegeneration may affect the GI tract ( ). In a recent paper, Pellegrini and colleagues observed that the induction of central nigrostriatal neurodegeneration with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rats is followed by major changes in colonic excitatory neuromotility [ ]. Moreover, they found evident signs of colonic inflammation in tissues from 6-OHDA rats, characterized by elevated levels of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and oxidative stress [ ]. Of note, these results are consistent with previous clinical findings that showed a rise in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF and IL-1\u03b2, and signs of glial cell activation (i.e., an increase in ganglionic GFAP levels) in colonic biopsies from patients with PD [ ]. \n\nFurthermore, colonic tissues from 6-OHDA rats displayed significant histopathological changes ranging from mucosal barrier alterations with leukocyte infiltration, decrease in epithelial claudin, and increase in S100-positive mucosal glia, up to a decrease in interstitial cells of Cajal, the pacemakers and mediators of gut neurotransmission [ ]. \n\nEven if some of the mechanisms underlying the role of EGCs in the gut\u2013brain communication have been clarified, much more still remain to be elucidated. Thus, further investigations are needed to better understand the origins of reactive gliosis, which could be triggered by changes in peripheral tissues (i.e., dysbiosis or external noxae) or descending stimuli from CNS. \n\n\n## 8. Conclusions \n  \nCurrent knowledge supports the view that the GI dysfunctions and glial changes found in PD patients are critical events for the initiation of neurodegeneration and are closely related with the disruption of IEB and alterations of gut microbiota composition [ ]. In this context, an abnormal activation of EGCs is likely responsible for neuroinflammation and the associated pathological changes in the ENS. IEB impairment, along with the involvement of EGC-mediated neuroinflammation in the early stages of PD development [ ], makes PD a multicentric disease and emphasizes the role of EGCs in the initiation and spread of neurodegenerative processes to the CNS. \n\nGlial involvement in the development of PD is consistent with Braak\u2019s studies, which showed that \u03b1-syn misfolding tends to occur first in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, particularly in the axon terminals of submucosal plexus and neurons of the myenteric plexus [ ]. Afterwards, misfolded \u03b1-syn would migrate to the nigrostriatal areas of CNS in a prion-like way. A diffusion of \u03b1-syn pathology in a \u201cprion-like\u201d fashion via a pathway involving glia to glia interactions has been postulated. However, the precise mechanisms accounting for the transmission of PD pathology to the nigrostriatal region remain unknown. \n\nWhile more studies are needed to validate the exact role of EGCs in the onset of PD and its progression from the intestine to CNS, it is conceivable that current knowledge might foster the identification of novel therapeutic interventions targeting the functions of EGCs in the early stages of the disease. In this regard, administering probiotics or eubiotics to modulate the dysbiosis, and developing medications able to reduce IEB impairment and EGC-induced neuroinflammation, might theoretically prevent or counteract the neurodegeneration ascending towards the CNS. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7730281, "text_md5": "28e1ca15adf39e610947a8b0960be63d", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 155], "journal": [156, 169], "publication_year": [171, 175], "title": [186, 308], "keywords": [322, 441], "abstract": [454, 1994], "body": [2003, 31082]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33276665, "doi": "10.3390/ijms21239199", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730281", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7730281"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730281\">7730281</a>", "list_title": "PMC7730281  Enteric Glia at the Crossroads between Intestinal Immune System and Epithelial Barrier: Implications for Parkinson Disease"}

Alternative splicing analysis produced a pattern of immune and RNA-processing disturbances. \n\n\n## Conclusions: \n  \nGenes with the greatest degree of differential expression did not overlap with genes exhibiting significant alternative splicing activity. Such variation indicates the importance of broadening expression studies to include exon-level changes because there can be significant differential splicing activity with potential structural consequences, a subtlety that is not detected when examining differential gene expression alone, or is underrepresented with probe-limited array technology. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurologic disorder, characterized by degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a high prevalence of dementia. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein processing, and aberrant alternative splicing are among the commonly considered pathways of dysfunction in PD. \n\nGene expression studies of PD and other neurologic disorders, via microarray and next-generation, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), have facilitated the expansion of gene expression knowledge. We previously found that axonal transport, cell adhesion, and mRNA splicing are the most prevalent dysregulated processes in PD cortical neurons, all occurring before the onset of dementia.  Because previous expression profiling provided evidence of significant spliceosome alterations, in the present study, we leveraged mRNA-seq to incorporate splice variant analysis. \n\nWe report here that differential alternative splicing in the cortex is associated with PD and Parkinson disease with dementia (PD-D), possibly contributing to the etiology of these diseases. We profiled posterior cingulate cortex, because the spread of \u03b1-synuclein pathology to this cortical region is associated with dementia in PD.  We found that genes displaying the highest degree of alternative splicing are somewhat disconnected from the greatest expression changes, although overlapping cellular processes are evident. Compared with gene expression profiling alone, alternative splice analysis of mRNA-seq data affords precision profiling in addition to an overview of global expression changes. \n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Tissue collection. \n  \nPosterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann Area 23) samples were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain Bank. All patients signed informed consent and were prospectively followed until death and autopsied according to previously published protocols.  PD clinical diagnoses were made using UK Brain Bank criteria and DSM-IV criteria for cognitive diagnoses. Neuropathologic diagnoses were made using the Unified Staging System for Lewy body disorders.  Cohorts studied were PD (N = 13; mean age 79.3 years \u00b1 6.8, 23% female), PD-D (N = 10; mean age 75.5 years \u00b1 7.0, 30% female), or healthy controls (N = 11; mean age 77.9 years \u00b1 7.9, 9% female). Samples were selected with a postmortem interval less than 3 hours. Posterior cingulate cortex was sectioned at 8-\u00b5m thickness and placed into standard 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction. \n\n\n### RNA extraction. \n  \nTRIzol reagent was used for initial RNA isolation per the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA solution was then processed through the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit, with DNase treatment, using the manufacturer's protocol. \n\n\n### mRNA-seq library preparation. \n  \nOne microgram of total RNA was used to generate mRNA-seq libraries for sequencing using Illumina's RNA Sample Prep Kit (catalog #FC-122-1001) using the manufacturer's protocol. Poly-A selection was performed using oligo(dT) magnetic beads, and double-stranded cDNA was generated and fragmented to a target size of 400 bp using sonication on the Covaris. Fragmented samples were end repaired and adenylated at the 3\u2032 end, and TruSeq Indexed adapters were ligated on. Libraries were enriched using the TruSeq PCR Master Mix and primer cocktail. Final libraries were cleaned and quantified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and Invitrogen Qubit. Libraries were equimolarly pooled for sequencing. \n\n\n### Paired-end sequencing. \n  \nDenatured and diluted libraries with a 1% phiX spike-in were used to generate clusters on Illumina's HiSeq Paired End v3 flowcell on the Illumina cBot using Illumina's TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 (catalog #PE-401-3001). The clustered flowcell was sequenced by synthesis on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 for paired 100-bp reads using Illumina's TruSeq SBS Kit V3 (catalog #FC-401-3001). \n\n\n### Sequencing and differential expression analysis. \n  \nAn average of 109 million paired-end, passing-filter reads (90 mers) were generated for each sample. Reads were trimmed of adapter sequences and aligned to   Homo sapiens   GRCh37.62 with   TopHat   (version 2.0.8, bowtie version 0.12.7) using default parameters. A table of read counts was assembled in R with the   easyRNASeq   package. Pairwise differential expression analyses between the groups was conducted with the   DESeq   package. \n\n\n### Gene ontology. \n  \nGeneMANIA  is a functional association tool used for data visualization and statistical analysis. It builds gene ontologies (GO)  from gene input lists and is freely available as a web application. \n\n\n### Alternative splicing analysis. \n  \nWe used SpliceSeq  (version 2.1), developed for alternative splicing detection in RNA-seq data, to investigate significant differential splicing events in disease groups (PD or PD-D) relative to controls (CON). SpliceSeq returns gene RPKM and exon OPKM (observations per kilobase of exon/splice per million aligned reads) normalized read values, defined, respectively, as \u201creads\u201d and \u201cobservations\u201d per kilobase of transcript length per million aligned reads. OPKM provides a measure of exon expression; a read that contains at least 4 bases of an exon is \u201cobserved.\u201d \n\nReads \u201cspliced in,\u201d i.e., reads that map to an exon, are calculated against the total number of reads that span the flanking exons, but skip it, plus the spliced in reads. This is the \u201cpercent spliced in\u201d (PSI) value assigned to each exon. The difference between the average exon PSI of \u201cgroup 2\u201d and \u201cgroup 1\u201d (e.g., PD minus CON) is termed delta PSI (dPSI). dPSI sample calculation: \n\n\n### Quantitative real-time PCR validation. \n  \nRNA extracted (described above) from PD, PD-D, and control tissues was processed with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for cDNA synthesis, per the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was completed using the Roche LightCycler 480 with SYBR Green detection. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nWe performed mRNA-seq on RNA samples isolated from the posterior cingulate cortex of individuals with either PD or PD-D or from healthy controls. Data analysis for this study focused on differential gene expression (DE) using DESeq, and alternative splicing (AS) events using SpliceSeq. DE and AS changes in PD and PD-D were quantified relative to CON. Genes from DE and AS analyses were compared for overlapping results, the DE data were run through GeneMANIA, and certain AS genes were validated by qRT-PCR. \n\n### Gene ontology and differential expression. \n  \nWe first compared gene-level expression profiles across disease groups. DE lists were restricted to the top 20 genes differentially expressed by fold change (fc) \u2265 |0.2| and   p   \u2264 0.001 (multiple test-corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure), as determined by DESeq analysis (  and table e-1 at  ). The top 20 DE genes from PD and PD-D vs CON were compared with gene networks for GO analysis. Functions (table e-2) associated with the top 20 overexpressed PD genes included cell chemotaxis, cytokine receptor binding, cAMP-mediated signaling, and ion homeostasis, whereas overexpressed PD-D genes were involved in unfolded or incorrectly folded protein responses. Underexpressed PD and PD-D genes shared a common involvement in hormone signaling. \n  \nTop 20 differentially expressed genes by disease group \n  \nComparison of PD with CON revealed changes in immune function and neuropeptide hormone function, including upregulation of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (  CXCL10  ) and downregulation of proenkephalin (  PENK  ). In the comparison of PD-D with CON, genes involved in the unfolded protein response were significantly upregulated, reflected by increased expression of dnaJ (Hsp40) homolog (  DNAJB1  ) and several heat shock protein genes, and an overall downregulation of hormone activity and ion transport, indicated by decreased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (  CRH  ),   PENK  , somatostatin (  SST  ), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4. \n\nPredominant pathways shared by both PD and PD-D included upregulated inflammatory responses, with increased expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (  CSF3  ), selectin-E (  SELE  ), and additional cytokines. Shared downregulated genes for signaling and cytoskeletal structure included decreased expression of   PENK   and keratin 5 (  KRT5  ); Vgf nerve growth factor (  VGF  ) was also downregulated across disease states. \n\n\n### Alternative splicing. \n  \nSpliceSeq identified significant disease-associated differences in transcript variants. SpliceSeq-predicted events were initially filtered for significance (  p   < 0.01) and dPSI > |0.2|, where dPSI is the change in exon expression of disease (PD or PD-D) vs CON. Additional filtering parameters considered the occurrence of the splicing event across all transcripts in the group (magnitude) and the number of samples within the group experiencing the event (percent observed) \u2013 both set to > |0.8| (1.0 = 100%). Finally, genes with the highest RPKM within the filtered lists (15\u2013100 RPKM) were preferentially picked for validation (table e-3). \n\nFive genes (total = 40) from the PD-D/CON comparison (  ATXN2  ,   DST  ,   HSPH1  ,   RELA  , and   SRRM1  ) and 2 genes (total = 10) from the PD/CON comparison (leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 [  LRRFIP1  ] and tripartite motif 9 [  TRIM9  ]) were chosen for qRT-PCR validation of the specific AS events ( ). Heat shock protein 105 kDa (  HSPH1  ), rel-like domain-containing (  RELA  ),   LRRFIP1  , and   TRIM9   may be grouped by processes of cellular maintenance or stress response (proliferation, apoptosis, etc.), and immune responses.   RELA  ,   LRRFIP1  , and   TRIM9   also code for transcription factors. Ataxin-2 (  ATXN2  ) and serine/arginine repetitive matrix 1 (  SRRM1  ) perform RNA-processing functions. Dystonin (  DST  ) is a cytoskeletal linking protein. \n   SpliceSeq \u201csplice graphs\u201d for the 7 qRT-PCR tested genes  \nRNA-seq transcript reads are aligned to composite gene graphs built from all possible isoforms existing in the Ensembl genome database. The graphs in this figure are partial splice graphs showing alternatively spliced regions. Values on graphs are splice observations per kilobase of transcript length per million aligned reads. Exon highlighting (determined by a log  exon expression ratio) indicates up- or downregulated exon expression or splicing as follows: green exons and splice arcs represent increased activity in the CON group and red exons and splice arcs represent either the PD or PD-D disease group. Gene splice graphs shown are specific for PD-D vs CON (  ATXN2  ,   DST  ,   HSPH1  ,   RELA  , and   SRRM1  ) or PD vs CON (  LRRFIP1   and   TRIM9  ). CON = control; PD = Parkinson disease; PD-D = PD with dementia; qRT = quantitative real-time. \n  \nWe performed qRT-PCR on exons predicted by SpliceSeq to experience an event, either exclusion from, or inclusion in the final transcript (  for exon sites and primer sequences). SpliceSeq-predicted exon-level expression changes ( ) were validated by comparison with qRT-PCR fc (2 ). Significant fc values <1 for primers covering exon skip regions and >1 for the exon inclusion event were considered validated. \n  \nSplicing events and qRT-PCR primer sequences \n     dPSI values for SpliceSeq-predicted alternatively spliced exons within the labeled genes  \nExon dPSI represents the difference in percent spliced in, disease vs CON (see   for exon details). CON = control; dPSI = delta percent spliced in; PD = Parkinson disease; PD-D = PD with dementia. \n  \nIn PD-D, skips were predicted by SpliceSeq at   ATXN2   exon 21, DST exon 104,   HSPH1   exon 13, and   SRRM1   exon 16, which disrupts a region reported as necessary for speckles and matrix localization. Exon 10.2 of   RELA   was predicted to be spliced in. This is a 687-bp inclusion containing a premature stop site that would result in a 377-amino acid truncated isoform and consequently eliminate an activation domain. \n\nIn PD, skips were predicted in   LRRFIP1   exons 18\u201319 within a coiled-coil structural region and   TRIM9   exons 8\u201310 within a fibronectin type III and B30.2/SPRY domain. \n\n\n### Quantitative real-time PCR. \n  \nThe fc of the predicted alternative splice sites were compared with fc of adjacent sites lacking any predicted splicing activity, referred to as \u201cno-splice\u201d (table e-4). Six of the 7 genes were predicted to have exon skips and 1 was predicted to have an exon inclusion (  RELA  ). \n\nAt splice-predicted sites of   ATXN2  ,   HSPH1  , and   SRRM1  , fc were <1 relative to CON, in addition to having reduced expression compared with sites without predicted splice events. This is consistent with exon exclusion events in these transcripts.   RELA  , at the predicted inclusion site, was greater than 1 and overexpressed relative to the no-splice site. This indicates specific inclusion of exon 10.2. A change in   DST   was indiscernible from CON and its no-splice site. \n\n LRRFIP1   and   TRIM9   fc values (<1) likewise indicate reduced exon expression of the predicted exon for each gene.   summarizes these results by comparing the fc of alternatively spliced transcripts to the main transcript isoforms (no-splice) as expression ratios, represented by percent exon inclusion of the alternative splice site. Exon skips are less than 100%, whereas the inclusion is greater than 100%. Results demonstrate that the vast majority of predicted AS events selected for validation were confirmed by secondary qRT-PCR measures. \n   qRT-PCR fold change comparison, disease vs CON, of splice vs no-splice primer sites  \nExon regions with expected alternative splicing activity are compared with flanking exon regions without predicted alternative splicing, \u201cno-splice.\u201d The dotted line indicates 100% inclusion (of a queried exon). CON = control; PD = Parkinson disease; PD-D = PD with dementia; qRT = quantitative real-time. \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nWe present an mRNA-seq reference data set to further characterize the cortical molecular etiology of PD and PD-D. In addition to significant gene-level differential mRNA expression, RNA-seq clearly reveals the underlying differential alternative splicing in the posterior cingulate cortex during the course of PD and PD-D. Alternative splicing of   ATXN2  ,   HSPH1  ,   SRRM1  ,   RELA  ,   LRRFIP1  , and   TRIM9   suggests dysregulation of genes within immune and inflammation responses and transcription and RNA processing. Compared with this alternative splicing profile, genes among those that were the most significantly differentially expressed (  CSF3  ,   SELE  ,   PENK  ,   VGF  ,   KRT5  ,   CRH  , and   SST  ) illustrate the breadth of PD gene dysregulation, beyond one level of expression analysis. In the overall expression changes, immune activity is prominent, but there is also evidence of disrupted neuronal signaling pathways. Immune responses and inflammation are consistently implicated in the course of many neurodegenerative disorders, including PD and PD-D, where microglia are commonly activated and inflammatory cytokines are overexpressed. \n\n CSF3   and   SELE   were overexpressed in both PD and PD-D relative to CON. Upregulation of both   CSF3   (or   G-CSF  ) and   SELE   in patients with PD, before considerable pathology in the posterior cingulate cortex, is consistent with an early role of immune induction in the progression of PD. \n\nCSF3 is a major cytokine regulator of neutrophils and promotes their increased production in bone marrow.  It can induce neuronal differentiation from adult progenitor cells and also protect neurons from apoptosis at the same time.  SELE is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that aids leukocytes in attaching to the endothelium; monocyte CAMs are activated in neurodegeneration.  Elevation of serum SELE has been detected in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and MS, but when investigated in patients with Alzheimer disease, levels did not differ.  We are not aware of other instances of induction in the cortex of patients with PD. \n\n PENK  ,   VGF  , and   KRT5   were underexpressed in both PD and PD-D relative to CON, which suggests potential deficits in neurotransmitter signaling and altered cytoskeletal function. \n\n PENK   is a precursor protein of signal peptides that function as neurotransmitters, autocrine and paracrine factors, and hormones.  Consistent with our expression results, evidence of significant downregulation was reported, relative to young CON (mean age 31), in both aging CON (mean age 77) and in patients with PD.  PENK   is also linked to bipolar disorder.  VGF is a neurosecretory protein most often expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neurons.  VGF expression in parietal cortex is reportedly reduced in PD,  and there is support for VGF as a biomarker of neurodegenerative and other diseases for its differential CF expression and cell type\u2013specific profiles within neuroendocrine organs.  KRT5   encodes a major keratin of the basal cell layer as part of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in basal keratinocytes. \n\n CRH   and   SST   were uniquely underexpressed in PD-D. Downregulation of certain hormone proteins suggests a potential hormone imbalance associated with dementia onset.   CRH  ,   SST  , and   PENK   are underexpressed, all of which are indicated by GO to be involved with an altered hormone-signaling state. \n\nThe genes that emerged from alternative splicing analyses did not exhibit a high degree of differential expression when assessed at the gene level. However, within the AS group, there are a variety of overlapping functions or instances of close networking. \n\nTripartite motif (TRIM) proteins belong to a subgroup of RING finger proteins, a structural feature that functions as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) to conjugate ubiquitin to target proteins.  TRIM9 is thought to be a targeting signal for proteasomal degradation, may be involved in neuron development and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and is a negative regulator of transcription factor nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation.  It has been found in Lewy bodies of both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD; expression is decreased in DLB and rabies virus\u2013infected brains, another case in which degeneration occurs.  Skipping of exons 8\u201310 approaching the C terminus (protein position 550\u2013636), shown in our data, affects a fibronectin type III and B30.2/SPRY domain. This domain is associated with microtubule binding among the RBCC (N-terminal RING finger/B-box/coiled coil) protein family, to which TRIM9 and many other TRIM proteins belong. Mutations in the C-terminal B30.2-like domain of another RBCC protein, MID1, disrupt localization and ubiquitin targeting. \n\nThe p65 protein is encoded by   RELA   and is a subunit of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor complex. They are part of a family of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and cell proliferation and differentiation.  NF-\u03baB nuclear localization, from the cytosol, is inhibited by I\u03baB association with the p50-p65 heterodimer, which is liberated upon phosphorylation of I\u03baB.  Of the splicing activity predicted and validated here, the exon inclusion (exon 10.2, protein position 347\u2013381) within   RELA   causes a protein truncation and the deletion of an activation domain, which would be predicted to cause overproduction of a truncated, inactive form of the protein. \n\n HSPH1  , a 105-kDa heat shock protein (HSP105), directs caspase-3\u2013mediated apoptosis after ER stress and interacts with \u03b1-tubulin to suppress disorganization during heat shock.  HSP105\u03b2 is a truncated isoform (92 kDa) induced specifically at 42\u00b0C.  Our data show a skip (exon 13, protein position 529\u2013572), elevated in PD-D compared with CON, consistent with this \u03b2-isoform. Normal physiologic temperature ranges from peripheral 33\u00b0C to fever-induced 39\u00b0C and does not reach the extreme temperature (42\u00b0C) associated with a heat shock response.  If the high-heat\u2013responding \u03b2-isoform is overproduced instead of the constitutively active form, signaling for apoptosis could be dampened as a result of reduced functional activity within the normal physiologic temperature range. \n\nSRRM1 (SR-related matrix protein of 160 kDa), is a pre-mRNA splicing coactivator that associates with the nuclear matrix along with its binding partner SRm300, aiding in recruitment of splicing factors to speckled regions and assembly of complexes.  Disruption to a sequence portion that is necessary for speckle and matrix localization could hinder recruitment of pre-mRNA to these areas and therefore disrupt proper splicing and processing to mature mRNA. In the patients with PD-D, exon 16 (protein position 558\u2013570), which is within the region encoding speckles and matrix localization specificity, is preferentially excluded in the mature mRNA. \n\nATXN2 is an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA processing and endocytosis, affecting membrane receptor presence. In vivo knockout of the mouse homolog,   SCA2  , leads to increased insulin production with a concurrent reduction in insulin receptors, resulting in obesity. Exclusion of exon 21 (protein position 1127\u20131145) was also previously identified by a broad sequencing and characterization study, although the effect of this particular event is unknown. Although a polyQ expansion within   ATXN2   is a notorious culprit of genetic malfunction, the exon 21 skip is far downstream (>2 kbp) from the well-studied region in exon 1. Considering the aforementioned mouse study, alternatively spliced   ATXN2   might interfere with cellular responses by reducing receptor production or membrane incorporation. However, the specific functional effect of this alternative splicing event is unclear. \n\n LRRFIP1   is a promoter-binding transcriptional repressor that regulates   EGFR   and may also regulate the proinflammatory cytokine   TNF  .  These functions suggest that it is tied to cell damage and injury response. Exon 18 and 19 (protein position 398\u2013459) skipping was increased in our PD group. Together, they partially encode coiled-coil domains and a prefoldin superfamily domain, protein features that promote protein-protein interactions and molecular chaperoning, respectively.  Exon skipping in this region has the potential to decrease binding affinity with LRRFIP1 targets and to interrupt any chaperone activity this protein may provide. \n\nAlthough alternative splicing is a normal mechanism of gene regulation, the pathways in which it is relatively increased suggest altered responses in the disease state. A number of scenarios are possible. An aberrantly spliced transcript may drive a pathway to become overactive, contributing to disease onset or progression. Another possibility is that cells in distress during the progression of PD and PD-D may experience altered splicing as a consequence of widespread dysfunction. Distinguishing between these possibilities is an important goal of future work. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4881621, "text_md5": "c157028f2c240d029a1351974593d15b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 225], "journal": [226, 238], "publication_year": [240, 244], "title": [255, 337], "keywords": [351, 351], "abstract": [364, 1641], "body": [1650, 24804]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 27275011, "doi": "10.1212/NXG.0000000000000075", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4881621", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4881621"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4881621\">4881621</a>", "list_title": "PMC4881621  Next-generation profiling to identify the molecular etiology of Parkinson dementia"}

A bibliographical search was employed, using \u201cParkinson\u2019s\u201d and \u201cShoulder Dysfunction\u201d as keywords. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging, twenty clinical and three US studies were selected as relevant to shoulder dysfunction in PD. Shoulder pain, frozen shoulder and arm swing asymmetry are the most prevalent clinical findings that may antedate cardinal PD symptoms. Supraspinatus tendon thickening or tearing, adhesive capsulitis, acromioclavicular changes, bursa and joint effusion are common shoulder MRI or US-detected abnormalities in mild or severe PD stages. Fractures due to falls or osteoporosis are secondary shoulder pathologies. Higher ipsilateral Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rated Scale (UPDRS) scores, rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia are associated with frozen shoulder. Disease duration, rigidity, and falls are contributing factors for tendon tears, adhesive capsulitis, and fractures respectively. When common symptoms, such as pain and frozen shoulder are unaccounted for by orthopedic or other local primary pathology, they might indicate underlying early PD. Timely diagnosis and appropriate early management of PD may, in turn, help delay or prevent shoulder-related complications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most frequent degenerative disorder of the central nervous system[ - ], affecting approximately 6.1 million individuals worldwide[ ]. Depletion of dopaminergic connections in the basal ganglia is one of the main histopathologic characteristics, causing dysfunction of pathways that are involved in the control of movement and balance[ , , ]. Although rigidity, rest tremor and bradykinesia are the three cardinal features of the disease[ , ], PD records a wide spectrum of motor and non-motor signs[ - , - ], such as musculoskeletal pain[ , , ], articular (frozen shoulder, dystonia, arthritis)[ , , , , ], postural (camptocormia, Pisa syndrome, kyphosis, scoliosis, dropped head syndrome)[ - , - ] and bone mineralization disorders (osteoporosis, osteopenia, low energy fractures)[ , , , ]. These non-motor disturbances often remain misdiagnosed and poorly treated[ , , , ]. \n\nMoreover, the bibliography which focuses on shoulder problems[ - ] leading to dysfunction[ , , , ] have been relatively sparse[ , , - ]. It is widely known that shoulder is a joint with complex and precise function consisting of four articulations (glenohumeral, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, and scapulothoracic) and a supportive network of muscles, as well as articular and periarticular structures, providing a perfect compromise between stability and extreme mobility[ - ]. Shoulder dysfunction refers to abnormalities in function of one or more contractile or non-contractile components[ , - ] and it is defined as an alteration in quality and quantity of shoulder in motion which might affect activities of daily living, even in the absence of shoulder pain or other readily recognized symptoms[ , - , ]. \n\nTwo out of three of all adults experience shoulder dysfunction in the course of their lifetime, with shoulder pain being the third most common reason for referral for physiotherapy[ , , , ]. However, little is known about the way PD affects the shoulder[ , , - ]. \n\nThe purposes of this literary review are threefold. The primary aim is to provide a critical overview of clinical findings of shoulder dysfunction in PD patients. Furthermore, in an attempt to understand the way that PD may affect shoulder function, the review is conducted beyond shoulder pathology in PD. Important insights into shoulder dysfunction may be gained by high-resolution imaging methods, primarily Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)[ ] and Musculoskeletal Ultrasonography (US)[ , , ]. In conclusion, the major focus is provided on the significance of an accurate and early diagnosis of shoulder dysfunction in PD for the prevention of severe shoulder-related complications. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe methodology is depicted on the flowchart ( ). \n  \nStudy flowchart. \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nComprehensive online literary research was conducted by the primary author (DP) in Pub Med, Google Scholar, Cochrane Collaboration, PLoS, Embase, Cinahl/EBSCO and PeDro bibliographic databases and registers, since May 2021 to gather relevant data on shoulder dysfunction in PD. A review of the literary sources was carried out from 1960 to 2022, while the final search was undertaken in May, 2022. MeSH-terms related to PD (Parkinson\u2019s disease (MeSH) OR Parkinson\u2019s) were explored and combined using the Boolean operator \u201cOR\u201d or \u201cAND\u201d \u201cshoulder dysfunction (MeSH)\u201d, \u201cdiagnostic clinical findings (MeSH)\u201d and \u201cimaging findings (MeSH)\u201d. \n\n\n### Inclusion Criteria \n  \nThe inclusion criteria were: 1) articles written in English, French or German; 2) patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD based on standard diagnostic criteria (e.g. UK Brain Bank or MDS[ - ], The Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)[ , ], Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale[ ]); 3) relative or clinically assessed PD group with any shoulder symptom (e.g. pain, weakness) either defined as shoulder dysfunction or disorder (subacromial bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff disease, subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinosis or tendinitis, partial or full thickness tendon tear, calcific tendinopathy, proximal humeral head fractures, glenohumeral or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, dislocation or shoulder instability, glenoid labrum pathologies, non-specific shoulder pain, which might affect the quality or quantity of shoulder motion[ , , , - ]). Original studies using control group (healthy or PD patients without shoulder dysfunction)[ , , , - ]; 4) clinical assessment of shoulder based on standardized criteria[ - ]; and 5) imaging assessment with high-resolution tools (e.g. MRI or US), following well-defined diagnostic criteria[ , , , - ] were preferable. \n\n\n### Screening and Extraction \n  \nRecords were primarily examined according to their title and abstract and those considered relevant to the purpose of the study were retrieved in full. The complete articles were imported to the same Mendeley Reference library and screened for duplicates. References from the included papers were also screened manually to find any further relevant publications (original articles, reviews, books, or other gray literature sources). \n\nTo conclude, any relative data to shoulder-related clinical and imaging (US and MRI) dysfunction in PD patients were selected ( ). \n\nThe review is organized as follows: 1) Clinical findings of shoulder dysfunction in PD; Assessment protocols and symptoms; 2) Diagnostic US and MRI imaging protocols and findings of shoulder dysfunction in PD; 3) Classification of shoulder dysfunction in PD based on MRI and US-detected underneath pathology in PD; 4) Contributing factors to shoulder dysfunction in PD; 5) Early diagnosis of shoulder dysfunction for the prevention of severe shoulder-related complications and 6) Hypothesis for the pathophysiology of shoulder dysfunction in PD. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 459 records were screened by title and abstract (22 from registers and 437 from the Pub Med (n=137), Google Scholar (n=49), Cochrane Collaboration (n=67), PLoS (n=168) and PeDro (n=16) databases. From the electronic search, 297 were clearly ineligible and 140 were assessed for eligibility. Moreover, 88 papers from the electronic search and 55 records from manual screening (references after cross-referencing, original articles, reviews, books, or other gray literature) were further assessed. To sum up, 77 articles based on inclusion/exclusion criteria were incorporated ( ). \n\nSince 1965 when Buchthal and Fernandez-Ballest[ ] published a study on alterations in electromyographic (EMG) activity of arm muscles, only nineteen papers were identified dealing with shoulder clinical symptoms[ , , - , , - ], three with US-detected shoulder disorders[ , , ] and one with MRI-detected shoulder disorders[ ]. \n\nOut of these, only one retrospective and one prospective study examined the prevalence of musculoskeletal problems, focusing on the issue of frozen shoulder and pain, in the initial stages of PD[ , ]. It is essential to include eleven case studies in PD patients regarding secondary shoulder pathology, such as arthritis, fractures and dislocations due to falls[ - ]. However, no quantitative study was found to measure the range of restricted shoulder movements in PD, or the underlying shoulder pathology in early or prodromal stages of PD, before severe complications. Most pertinent studies on shoulder symptoms, and clinical and US-detected dysfunction in PD are summarized in Tables  -  and  . \n  \nCommon clinical and imaging findings and associations of shoulder dysfunction in Parkinson\u2019s Disease. \n      \nClinical and Imaging Assessment of Shoulder Dysfunction in Parkinson\u2019s Disease. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nClinical and imaging assessment and findings of shoulder dysfunction are presented in detail in the following sections and are summarized in Tables  -   and Figures  - . \n  \nClinical and imaging findings [based on Yucel & Kusbeci (2010)[ ]; Madden & Hall (2010); Riley et al.

(2009)[ ]; Yucel & Kusbeci (2009)[ ]; Yucel & Kusbeci (2010)[ ]; Madden & Hall (2010)[ ]; Riley et al. (1989)[ ]; Cleeves et al. (1989)[ ]; Chang et al. (2015)[ ]; Koh et al. (2008)[ ]; Gundogdu et al. (2016)[ ]; Koh et al. (2019)[ ]; Stamey et al. (2008)[ ]]. \n  \n### Clinical Assessment and Findings of Shoulder Dysfunction in PD \n  \n\n### Clinical Features of Shoulder Dysfunction in PD \n  \nThe shoulder is one of the body parts most commonly involved in the PD group[ , ]. The clinical characteristics of shoulder dysfunction in PD are: 1) Restricted movements due to shoulder rigidity, frozen shoulder, akinesia, arm swing loss, or muscle weakness[ , , ]; and/or 2) altered quality of shoulder motion due to arm tremor, bradykinesia or pain. Shoulder pain and stiffness are the most frequent symptoms of shoulder dysfunction in PD (Tables  - ). \n\n\n### Prevalence of Shoulder Dysfunction in PD \n  \nRiley and colleagues (1989)[ ] first found a significantly higher incidence of shoulder symptoms history (43% vs. 23%) in a group of 150 PD patients compared to 60 matched healthy controls[ ]. Kim and colleagues (2013)[ ] studied 400 PD patients and 138 age- and sex-matched controls and found that the shoulder was more affected in the PD group than in the control group (15.0% vs. 8.7%)[ ]. \n\n\n### Shoulder Dysfunction in the Early PD Stages \n  \nLiterary search reveals that the main features of shoulder dysfunction, shoulder pain and frozen shoulder are well-recognized harbingers that may antedate PD by several months or even years[ , , , , , , , ]. Shoulder pain and mobility abnormalities may be present in early PD stages[ , ], or may antedate a diagnosis of cardinal PD symptoms by several months[ , , , , , , , ], yet they are only observed when more complex coordination is required[ , ]. \n\n\n### Cardinal PD Symptoms Contributing Factors for Shoulder Dysfunction \n  \nResults from recent studies indicate that cardinal PD symptoms of rigidity[ ], rest tremor[ , ] and bradykinesia[ ] could alter shoulder function, as they are related to alterations in muscle activity[ , , , ], coordination[ ] range of motion[ , ]. \n\nConcerning tremor, it is a cardinal PD symptom that is characterized by a frequency of 4 to 6-Hz in a relaxed limb, temporarily reducing or disappearing when the limb is held outstretched[ ]. Buchthal and Fernandez-Ballesteros[ ] (1965) managed to detect tremors using electromyography when it was not apparent in clinical examination. They concluded that rest tremor involves more distant than proximal shoulder muscles, whereas the number of involved proximal muscles had increased voluntary effort, both during walking and in slight effort. On the other hand, during voluntary effort the tremor rate was increased[ ]. \n\nRigidity is another cardinal PD symptom referring to increased muscle tone causing stiffness, as well as velocity-independent involuntary resistance to passive movement, with or without cogwheel phenomenon[ ]. \n\nFurthermore, bradykinesia is a cardinal PD symptom referring to slowness of movement and progressively smaller movements in an individual\u2019s attempt to repeat a task multiple times[ ]. \n\nRigidity and bradykinesia are frequently associated with pain, muscle weakness[ ] and reduction of arm swing[ ] ( ). Kwon and colleagues (2014)[ ] studied two groups (a concordance group of twenty-one PD patients who had both rigidity and bradykinesia and a discordance group of nineteen PD patients, who had either bradykinesia or rigidity[ ]. Two independent neurologists blindly analyzed video clips, accessed asymmetric characteristics of gait and posture, concluding that there was only a significant, but moderate association between the side of more dominant rigidity with the side of reduced arm and leg swing[ ]. \n\nRigidity and long PD duration have been identified as important contributing factors for the development of adhesive capsulitis and tendon tearing respectively[ , , ]. Increased severity of PD and falls seem to lead to advanced shoulder pathologies, such as tendon tears, adhesive capsulitis[ , , ] and fractures[ ]. Higher UPDRS, tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia subscores are associated with increased effusion around biceps tendon, as well as with increased thickness of supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons in PD patients with frozen shoulder[ ]. \n\nThe relation of clinical and imaging findings of shoulder dysfunction with PD stages and duration are presented in  . \n\n\n### Shoulder Pain in PD \n  \nCleeves and Findley first reported a total of twelve out of a hundred consecutive PD patients with shoulder pain as the first symptom[ ]. Since then, there are six more papers regarding shoulder pain in PD. Prevalence of shoulder pain varies between 11% to 81% of PD patients[ , , - , ]. \n\nDe Mattos and colleagues (2019)[ ] conducted a cross-sectional study in fifty-four PD patients, and found that pain was more common in the lower limbs (33.0%) and shoulders/cervical spine (31.0%). Musculoskeletal pain was more frequent (in 81.5% of subjects) than nocturnal (52.6%) or fluctuation-related pain (47.3%), involved in working and general activities in 55.3% of the subjects[ ]. \n\nTinazzi and colleagues (2006)[ ] studied different types of pain in PD and revealed that musculoskeletal pain was the most predominant type, attributed to 41% of the total pain[ ]. A cross-sectional and retrospective study by Madden and Hall (2010)[ ] in 25 consecutively recruited PD subjects and their 25 normal controls, revealed that shoulder pain was characterized as dull and aching by most PD patients. 80% of the PD group and 20% of the control group mentioned bilateral shoulder pain. PD patients were six times more likely than controls to have shoulder pain. After adjusting for age, gender and prior injury, the odds increased to 21 times[ ]. \n\nAs previously mentioned, there is evidence that shoulder pain may antedate PD diagnosis for months or even years. Farnicova and colleagues (2012)[ ] retrospectively studied the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in the prodromal phase of PD. They searched the hospital inpatient and outpatient clinic admission notes of eighty-two PD patients. Musculoskeletal pain initially classified as osteoarthritis, degenerative spine disease, and frozen shoulder, was the presenting prodromal PD symptom in twenty-seven (33%) cases. Joint pain was present in nine cases and was usually diagnosed as \u201cfrozen shoulder\u201d or arthritis. One out of three PD patients, who went on to develop motor features of PD, had musculoskeletal pain as an initial symptom. The mean time from initial symptom appearance to dopaminergic treatment was 6.6 years in the musculoskeletal pain group, compared to 2.3 years in the cardinal PD sign onset group[ ]. An additional retrospective study of three-hundred and nine, which consecutively recruited PD patients, revealed that 20% of the sample reported that shoulder pain preceded the onset of cardinal PD symptoms within several years[ ]. Finally, Teive et al. (2016)[ ] conducted five years prospective study about the initial symptoms of 15 early PD patients at two tertiary movement disorders clinics. They concluded that PD patients may present with unusual symptoms, such as shoulder pain in an early stage. They urge specialists to be aware of these conditions as clues to an accurate diagnosis[ ]. \n\nRegarding contributing factors, Gundogdu et al. (2016)[ ] concluded that musculoskeletal pain is associated with female gender and older age, whereas it is independent of H&Y stage, PD disease duration, and medication[ ] ( ). \n\n\n### Frozen Shoulder in PD \n  \nIn the general population, frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a common musculoskeletal problem that causes disabling pain, stiffness, severe mobility limitation and disability in activities of daily living[ , ]. The estimated cumulative incidence in the general population is 2.4 per 1000 people per year[ ]. \n\nRecent studies[ , , , , ] indicated that frozen shoulder could be a presenting symptom of PD[ , , , ] ( ,  ). The frequency of frozen shoulder in PD patients was first assessed by Riley and colleagues (1989)[ ]. PD patients had a significantly higher incidence of frozen shoulder (12.7% vs. 1.7%) compared to the controls, with an average duration of seven years, and a mean onset of two years before PD diagnosis. What is more, the onset of PD symptoms was ipsilateral to the frozen shoulder in sixteen out of nineteen PD patients[ ]. In 2004, Gilbert[ ] presented a case with frozen shoulder, severe pain and stiffness in bilateral lower biceps brachii for two years, before the PD onset responded promptly to the initiation of L-dopa therapy[ ]. Kim and colleagues (2013)[ ] also found that frozen shoulder (among other musculoskeletal problems) was significantly more prevalent in PD patients than in the control group[ ]. Farnicova and colleagues (2012)[ ] found that musculoskeletal pain was present as a prodromal PD symptom in 27 (33%) cases initially diagnosed with osteoarthritis, degenerative spinal disease, and frozen shoulder[ ]. Joint pain was present in 9 cases and was usually diagnosed as \u201cfrozen shoulder\u201d or arthrosis[ ]. Alarcon and colleagues[ ] (2020) evaluated 146 consecutively recruited PD patients, who did not have a progressive reduction in the speed and amplitude of finger tapping or other physical signs indicative of bradykinesia. MRI with 110 T2 FLAIR was performed at baseline. The clinical examination included videotaping, UPDRS, Part I-II-III, the Hamilton depression and anxiety scales, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Frozen shoulder (17% vs. 9%) showed no differences between groups at baseline. All patients were followed up every three months for a minimum of one year. T In the last follow-up visit, the probability of developing PD was higher when patients had a frozen shoulder (OR 3.1; 95%CI 1.6-6.2). They also found that frozen shoulder was one of the early signs of PD that may be related to bradykinesia[ ]. \n\n\n### Arm Swing Asymmetry in PD \n  \nArm swing asymmetry is a common sign of early PD diagnosis[ ] ( ). In the literary search, four experimental electromyographic and kinematics studies were found relevant to the loss or asymmetry of arm swing during gait[ , , , ]. \n\nBuchthal and Fernandez-Ballesteros (1965)[ ] first published a paper on arm swing reduction during walking in twenty-four out of twenty-four arms in eighteen PD patients. Abnormal electromyographic patterns, such as continuous rhythmical activity in both flexors were primarily observed in the muscles normally active during walking. These abnormal patterns were observed in the arms ipsilateral to the predominant PD signs. As the severity of the disease increased, muscles that were normally inactive during walking showed abnormal electromyographic patterns[ ] as well. \n\nKoh and colleagues (2019)[ ] used 3D motion analysis in order to compare arm swing and gait parameters between forty-one early PD patients and thirty-three controls, walking at self-selected speed. They found that the reduction of arm and leg swings during gait in PD was associated with rigidity, but not with bradykinesia[ ]. \n\n\n### Shoulder Muscle Weakness in PD \n  \nSevere weakness in shoulder muscles is rare in PD[ , , ]. Nevertheless, Buchthal and Fernandez-Ballesteros (1965) found that muscle force in the PD-affected shoulder was slightly reduced (graded as 4 and 4+) in 4/18 (22%) and moderately reduced (graded as 3) in 3/18 (16%) of patients (grading according to the definition of the Medical Research Council in 1942)[ ]. According to King and Horak (2008)[ ], muscle weakness, largely due to secondary to abnormal muscle activation associated with bradykinesia and rigidity, can be present at all stages of PD. Muscle weakness similar to other mobility abnormalities may be apparent in mild PD patients, but it is only observed when more complex coordination is required[ ]. \n\n\n### Clinical Assessment Protocols \n  \nStudies of shoulder dysfunction in PD rely on PD diagnostic criteria used when they were conducted. In studies conducted before 2015, PD was diagnosed using previous PD criteria, such as the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria[ , ], or Gelb criteria[ ], and not the recent Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD (MDS) that the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society[ , ] proposes. In the relevant studies, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III58 and/or Hoehn and Yahr staging (H&Y)[ , ] or modified H&Y scales were used to rate PD severity and progress respectively (Tables  - )[ , ]. \n\nAlthough the US and neurological exam protocols are well-defined in previous studies, thorough musculoskeletal exam protocols have not been reported. Data concerning shoulder pain and mobility problems or disability in PD patients were mostly retrieved from self-questionnaires[ , , , ] completed by enrolled patients and rarely from interviews[ ]. Only Alwardata et al. (2018)[ ] assessed disability and upper limb function with objective clinical tools, the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and Madden and Hall (2010)[ ] assessed the severity of pain using a visual analog scale[ ]. Pain could be also evaluated with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) or the King\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s Disease Pain Scale (KPPS). These scales were used by de Mattos and colleagues (2019)[ ] to examine the relationship between pain characteristics and motor dysfunction in individuals with PD[ ]. \n\n\n### Imaging Assessment and Findings of Shoulder Dysfunction in PD \n  \nA literary search revealed an MRI[ ] and three US studies[ , , ] which evaluate shoulder pathology in PD patients (Tables  - ). Moreover, radiography has been mainly used for the diagnosis of fractures, dislocations, arthritis or adhesive capsulitis[ , - ]. \n\n\n### Shoulder MRI Findings in PD \n  \nMRI is the primal tool in the detection of complex shoulder pathologies. A case-control study by Yucel and Kusbeci (2010)[ ] is the only one evaluating MRI findings of the shoulder in PD patients. Twenty-eight PD patients (56 shoulders) and thirteen age-matched (26 shoulders) controls underwent MRI with a 1.5-T MR machine and a dedicated shoulder surface coil. The shoulder MR imaging protocol included: Oblique sagittal proton density-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, oblique coronal proton density-weighted, and axial T2 weighted gradient-echo images[ ]. The glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints, the biceps, the rotator cuff muscles, the acromiohumeral distance, the subacromial-subdeltoid, and the subcoracoid bursa were examined[ ]. \n\n\n### Shoulder US Findings in PD \n  \nUS is an effective imaging modality to detect shoulder disorders in real-time, as it is a low-cost imaging tool, easy to administrate. It is comprehensively used for the shoulder evaluation[ ], as it neither utilizes ionizing radiation nor requires an invasive procedure. Moreover, it can be used in cases of tremor where MRI is difficult to perform, since it allows tendon imaging in a weight-bearing position, from different angles[ , ]. \n\nIn the literary search, three studies[ , , ] used US for the evaluation of shoulders in PD patients. In all sonographic studies, US was applied within real-time equipment, using a 11MHz[ ] or 12/5 MHz[ ] linear array transducer. Standard protocols and criteria for the US evaluation of the shoulder were also employed in PD patient\u2019s examination[ , , ] ( ). The long head of the biceps as well as the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons were examined in transverse and longitudinal planes in proper position[ , , ]. \n\n\n### Classification of Shoulder Dysfunction based on MRI and US-detected Underneath Pathology in PD \n  \nIn the literary search, US and MRI findings of the shoulder were studied in mild and severe PD patients[ , , ] and/or PD patients with frozen shoulder[ ]. The most common US and MRI-detected abnormal findings leading to shoulder dysfunction, were partial or full-thickness tendon tear, tendinosis, bursa effusion, joint and bone changes[ , , , ]. MRI and US imaging tools enabled the classification of shoulder dysfunction according to the abnormalities detected in shoulder structures. \n\n\n### Dysfunction related to MRI or US-detected Rotator Cuff Disorders in PD \n  \nThe most common shoulder disorders that cause rotator cuff dysfunction are tendon tear or thickness of supraspinatus[ , , ], infraspinatus[ ], biceps effusion and tendon thickness of subscapularis[ , ] (Figures   and  ). \n\n\n### Rotator Cuff Tendon Tears in PD \n  \nComplete tendon tears are detected as tendon non-visualization, anechoic or hypoechoic discontinuity, and deltoid herniation[ , ]. Partial tears are defined as focal heterogenous hypoechogenicity and an incomplete hypoechoic defect[ , ]. Rotator cuff, mainly supraspinatus, and tendon tears were US-detected in 70% of the PD patients (22 out of 33) in the study of Koh and colleagues (2008)[ ]. A significantly longer duration of disease was found in PD patients with tendon tearing than in patients without tearing[ ] ( ). Full-thickness supraspinatus tears were also observed in the MRI study conducted by Yucel and Kusbeci (2010)[ ]. In this study, full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus were observed only in the mild and the severe PD groups, but not in the control group ( ). Furthermore, significantly higher UPDRS total scores, tremor, and rigidity sub scores and a longer duration of PD were observed in PD patients with full-thickness tears[ ]. \n\nYucel and Kusbeci (2009)[ ] sonographically evaluated the shoulders in PD, examining the difference between the mild and severe PD patients. Thirty-five PD patients (14 females, 53 males; mean age, 66.4\u00b19.5 years) were divided into two groups according to H&Y scale. The first group included thirty shoulders of mild PD patients (H&Y stage I-II), and the second group examined thirty-seven shoulders of severe PD patients (H&Y stage III-IV). Three (8.1%) severe patients had full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus tendon and one patient (2.7%) had tear in the infraspinatus tendon. No significant difference was found in US findings between the patients with mild and severe PD[ ]. \n\n\n### Biceps Effusion and Tendon thickness of Subscapularis and Supraspinatus in PD Patients with Frozen Shoulder \n  \nOn the contrary, abnormal effusion around the biceps tendon sheath was more common in mild patients (26.7%) than in severe (24.3%) ones, in the study of Yucel and Kusbeci (2009)[ ]. In the prospective study of Chang et al. (2015)[ ], increased effusion in the biceps tendon as well as increased tendon thickness of subscapularis and supraspinatus were associated with higher ipsilateral UPDRS and tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia sub scores[ ] ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Dysfunction related to MRI or US-detected Adhesive Capsulitis in PD \n  \nAdhesive capsulitis is diagnosed as difficulty in US detection of subscapularis due to reduced external rotation of subscapularis and increased fluid in the dependent portion of the bicipital tendon sheath[ ]. \n\nThe MRI and US studies confirmed that adhesive capsulitis with frozen shoulder symptoms is common in PD. In 2008, Koh and colleagues[ ] US evaluated the shoulders of 33 PD patients and they discovered concomitant adhesive capsulitis with symptoms of frozen shoulder in 9 patients and a significantly higher rigidity score in PD patients with adhesive capsulitis compared to controls[ ]. \n\nIn a prospective study, Chang and colleagues[ ] (2015) evaluated clinically and sonographically sixty shoulders of 30 PD patients. Frozen shoulder syndrome was detected in nineteen shoulders of fourteen PD patients, including bilateral involvement in five and unilateral involvement in nine patients. Significant positive correlation was found between the mean ipsilateral UPDRS III and tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia scores and US findings (i.e., the thickness of bicipital effusion, subscapularis and supraspinatus tendon thickness)[ ]. \n\nIn the study conducted by Yucel and Kusbeci (2010)[ ], PD disease duration and clinical severity of rigidity were significantly correlated with US-diagnosed disorders[ ] ( ). \n\n\n### Dysfunction related to Effusion in Subacromial-subdeltoid Bursa in PD \n  \nYucel and Kusbeci (2009)[ ] found that abnormal effusion in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa was more frequently detected in severe (29.7%) than in mild PD (16.7%) patients ( ,  ). Nevertheless, there was no statistically important difference between the mild and the severe PD patients[ ]. \n\n\n### Dysfunction related to Articular Disorders in PD \n  \n\n### Acromioclavicular and Subcoracoid Changes in PD \n  \nAbnormalities in the acromioclavicular joints, the subcoracoid effusion, and the narrow acromiohumeral distance were the most common MRI findings in PD patients[ ] (Figures  ,  ). Severe PD patients with longer disease duration had a higher frequency of acromioclavicular joint changes, compared to the control group. Subcoracoid effusion was more common in patients with higher UPDRS and rigidity scores. Mild PD patients showed a higher frequency of resting tremor and subcoracoid effusion than severe ones[ ]. An additional abnormal finding was that the acromiohumeral distance was notably reduced in PD patients compared to controls, but there was no statistically significant difference with respect to this parameter between mild and severe PD patients[ ]. \n\n\n### Dysfunction due to Myofascial Pain Syndrome in PD \n  \nMyofascial pain syndrome is characterized by pain on sustained compression over the tender point within a taut band of the muscle, a referred pain, or a local twitch response within the band[ ]. Koh and colleagues (2008)[ ] studied the association between myofascial syndrome and PD severity, bradykinesia, tremor and shoulder disability and found no significant difference between PD patients with and without myofascial syndrome[ ]. \n\n\n### Dysfunction related to Bone Disorders in PD \n  \nThe results of the MRI and other imaging studies unveiled bone abnormalities, such as cortical irregularity, fractures, edema and cyst formation in PD patients[ ]. Shoulder arthritis is also associated with bone dysfunction[ - ]. \n\n\n### Shoulder Fractures and Dislocation in PD-Secondary Pathology due to Falls or Osteoporosis \n  \nEleven case studies were found relevant to secondary shoulder bone pathology[ - ], due to falls or osteoporosis. Osteoporosis contributes to low-energy shoulder fractures[ - ]. Falls commonly cause fractures in the humeral bone or glenohumeral dislocations[ - ]. \n\nThese bone disorders were diagnosed with MRI or X-ray radiography and treated with surgical procedures[ , , ]. Numerous studies suggest poor outcomes in the recovery of function and a higher postoperative complication rate after shoulder arthroplasty for fractures and dislocations in patients with PD[ , , ]. \n\n\n### Timely Diagnosis for Prevention of Shoulder-Related Complications in PD \n  \nBased on the above data, although musculoskeletal pain and frozen shoulder could adversely affect the quality of life, they are often misdiagnosed, under-evaluated, and/or under-treated[ , ]. Early clinical and imaging diagnosis of these disabling syndromes is crucial for the quality of life among high-risk population[ , ] as it may prevent or delay severe shoulder-related complications. Musculoskeletal shoulder complaints should be evaluated attentively in PD patients on clinical basis[ ], in order to provide them with targeted and comprehensive management of dysfunction. \n\nArm swing asymmetry may prove a useful clinical symptom for early PD diagnosis[ ]. Frozen shoulder, restricted movements, pain and other clinical features of shoulder dysfunction might be clues to an accurate PD diagnosis and should ideally be objectively examined among the PD population, a procedure that is seldom performed in studies so far. In published clinical studies, mobility limitations are usually based on subjective variables and not on objective measurements. \n\nAn evidence-based approach that stems from focused, validated physical exam maneuvers and objective measurements of shoulder dysfunction through imaging modalities would be crucial for contemporary research, especially in early stages of PD, to promote timely, accurate diagnosis and target rehabilitation regarding dysfunctional structures. \n\n\n### Proposed Assessment Protocols for Shoulder Dysfunction in PD \n  \nBased on other studies among the majority of population, a detailed examination of shoulder function and kinematics could include goniometry and special tests for rotator cuff (e.g. Jobe test, Hawkin\u2019s test, drop arm test for rotator cuff tear)[ - ], tests for biceps (e.g. Speed\u2019s test)[ ], Neer\u2019s test for impingement syndrome[ - ] and Apley scratch test for shoulder flexibility[ , , ] ( ). \n\n\n### Hypothesis for Pathophysiology of Rotator Cuff Dysfunction in PD \n  \nThe supraspinatus tendon is the most commonly affected tendon and it is prone to degeneration and tears, probably due to the location and poor vascularity of the \u201ccritical area\u201d, an anatomical landmark demarcator, situated approximately 10 mm close to the insertion of the supraspinatus tendon with complex vascular pattern[ , ]. The developing process of rotator cuff degeneration and tear should be taken into consideration in order to explain the high frequency of tendinosis of the long head and the biceps tendon in mild PD patients[ , ]. In the beginning, a thickening of the tendon (tendinosis) is observed, followed by its decline, which appears as micro-tears and atrophy[ , ]. The correlation between tendon tear with longer PD duration, leads us to the assumption that the earlier the PD diagnosis and treatment, the better the delay of tendon rupture process. \n\n\n### Hypothesis for Pathophysiology of Shoulder Pain in PD \n  \nThe differential diagnosis and pathophysiology of shoulder pain is a complex process due to the anatomical and biomechanical complexity in the function of articular and periarticular shoulder structures. So far, there is no sufficient evidence to explain the pathophysiology of shoulder pain, especially before the clinical manifestation of PD[ ]. Madden and Hall (2010)[ ] tested the hypothesis that prior injury is related to shoulder pain in PD, but none of the PD subjects reported previous shoulder injury compared to 70% of the controls. The increased prevalence of shoulder pain may be related to the rigidity observed in PD. Nevertheless, in that study, the majority of PD subjects suffered from bilateral shoulder pain, despite the asymmetry of rigidity during the exam[ ]. Another study concludes that PD patients have a lower heat pain threshold compared to controls, with the authors hypothesizing that basal ganglia abnormalities may alter pain coding[ ]. Additionally, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans have shown that striatal D2 receptors are involved in central pain pathways and that a decrease in D2 receptors increases pain perception[ ]. Valkovic et al. (2015)[ ] attest that different types of pain were reported in a sample of 100 PD patients, such as musculoskeletal, dystonic, central neuropathic, radicular and other pains. These findings suggest that pain in PD may be related to the underlying pathophysiology of PD rather than motor signs[ ]. \n\n\n### Hypothesis for Pathophysiology of Frozen Shoulder in PD \n  \nRegarding the pathophysiology of frozen shoulder, inflammation plays a leading role in the primary disease process, yet the way it begins is not clear[ ]. Causes of inflammation in adhesive capsulitis include tendon inflammation, trauma, subacromial impingement, and bursitis[ ]. From a pathogenic point of view, a three-phase pathogenesis that advocates spontaneous recovery has been proposed[ ]. The first phase is characterized by increasing pain during movement, without significant loss of motion. In phase two, the shoulder range of motion becomes progressively limited and pain occurs at the end of the range[ ]. \n\n\n### Hypothesis for the Involvement of Other Musculoskeletal Disorders in Shoulder Dysfunction \n  \nFuture studies may examine more thoroughly the involvement of other common musculoskeletal disorders[ ], such as postural disorders of the spine (camptocormia) and low bone mineralization (osteoporosis, low energy fractures) in shoulder pathology in PD patients ( ). All in all, special consideration should be given to the disturbances of neuromuscular coordination, muscle synergy, articular and periarticular shoulder dysfunction in different stages of PD. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, shoulder dysfunction in PD is characterized by pain and mobility limitation due to rigidity, frozen shoulder, arm swing loss or weakness. Dysfunction is related to the underlying pathology of rotator cuff tendons, capsule and other articular or periarticular structures of glenohumeral and sternoclavicular joints which should be early diagnosed using high-resolution imaging tools, such as US or MRI. \n\nThe US constitutes an effective imaging modality to detect shoulder dysfunction in real-time, especially in cases of tremor where MRI is difficult to be applied. US and MRI examination of shoulder reveals that the most commonly detected abnormalities in mild and severe PD patients, are partial or full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear, tendinosis, bursa effusion, joint and bone changes. \n\nFrozen shoulder and pain are well-recognized harbingers that may antedate PD diagnosis. Therefore, the diagnosis of PD needs to be suspected along with the presence of otherwise unexplained shoulder symptoms. Long duration, tremor, rigidity, increased severity of PD, and falls seem to predispose experts to advanced shoulder pathologies, such as tendon tears, adhesive capsulitis, and fractures. Therefore, it is essential not only to address local shoulder symptomatology but also to appropriately diagnose and manage the motor symptoms of PD as, among other reasons, the symptoms themselves bespeak the above shoulder-related complications. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 10233223, "text_md5": "e53113851db6b11800336f9e29456034", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 175], "journal": [176, 209], "publication_year": [211, 215], "title": [226, 330], "keywords": [344, 471], "abstract": [484, 1929], "body": [1938, 41615]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 37259665, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233223", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=10233223"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233223\">10233223</a>", "list_title": "PMC10233223  Shoulder Dysfunction in Parkinson Disease: Review of Clinical, Imaging Findings and Contributing Factors"}

PD is a highly clinically heterogeneous condition traditionally characterized by cardinal motor symptoms, such as resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia; however, PD also manifests various non-motor symptoms throughout the course of disease, such as cognitive impairment, apathy, and depression.  The neurophysiology of PD is complex. Modern neuroimaging techniques have featured prominently in attempts to understand the pathophysiology in vivo. \n\nCortical thickness (CTh) analysis is popular surface-based technique for cortical gray matter (GM) assessment. A growing number of studies have used CTh analysis to investigated brain morphology in PD relating to demographic and clinical characteristics, such as age of onset, age, disease duration, motor deficits, disease stages, and divergent non-motor symptoms.  Some studies suggested that CTh alterations may be indicators of neural degeneration occurring in PD,  while some other CTh studies argued against that view as they failed to identify morphological features in patients with PD relative to healthy controls (HCs).  Despite the many advances in our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of PD, the results of the CTh analysis in PD across studies are inconsistent and have not been systematically reviewed. \n\nCoordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is powerful tool to quantitatively integrate the results of individual neuroimaging studies.  Recently, CBMA has been developed for surface-based morphometric (SBM) studies to identify consistent CTh abnormalities in major depressive disorder.  In the present study, we conducted a CBMA of SBM studies that investigate CTh alterations in PD using Seed-based   d   Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis protocol will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P).  The protocol of this CBMA was registered at PROSPERO ( ) (registration number: CRD42020148775). No ethical approval is required because the data used in this paper are from published studies without the involvement of animals or individual experiments. \n\n### Data sources and study selection \n  \nThe online databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science will be searched, using the keywords \n\n((Parkinson disease) or Parkinson\u2217) and ((cortical Thickness) OR (cortical thinning) OR (surface-based morphometry)) without language limitations from the database inception to the July 1, 2019 and updated on Feb 2, 2020. The following databases China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and SinoMed will be also searched for studies published in Chinese. Additionally, the reference lists of relevant reviews and the articles selected for inclusion were further manually searched. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nThe articles included in the CBMA should meet the following inclusion criteria: included patients with idiopathic PD diagnosed according to the accepted criteria; compared regional CTh differences between patients with idiopathic PD and HC subjects at the whole-brain cortical level; reported peak coordinates of significant clusters in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space; was a case-control original article published in a peer-reviewed journal without the limit of language. \n\n\n#### Exclusion criteria \n  \nPublications will be excluded if they met the following exclusion criteria: the sample size was fewer than 7 either in the PD group or the HC group ; the studies included PD patients with dementia; the studies reported significant results without listing three-dimensional coordinates; the studies only employed regions of interest (ROI) analysis; the studies only conducted the global CTh analysis; the studies lacked an HC group; the studies with the patient samples were overlapped with the another one with the largest sample size. The studies were longitudinal without performing baseline comparisons. The publications were not an original type, such as conference abstracts, research protocols, letters, reviews, and editorials. \n\nFigure   presents the process of study selection in accordance with the PRISMA flowchart. \n  \nStudy selection process in accordance with the PRISMA flowchart. CTh\u200a=\u200acortical thickness; PD\u200a=\u200aParkinson's disease; PRISMA\u200a=\u200aPreferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, ROI\u200a=\u200aregions of interest; SBM\u200a=\u200asurface-based morphometry. \n  \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nCurrently, there was no objective tool to perform quality assessment for CTh studies. Referring to the previous work,  we used a 12-point checklist to assess the quality of each included study in the CBMA (Table  ). This checklist integrated the items regarding the sample characteristics and imaging-specific methodology employed in the studies. \n  \nThe checklist of quality assessment for the included cortical thickness studies. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe following specific data will be extracted from the included studies: the first author's family name, publication year, sample size, male number, age, education (years), disease duration, United Parkinson disease rating scale, part III (UPDRS-III), Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, mini-mental state examination (MMSE), levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), MRI scanner manufacturer and platform, field strength, head coil, MRI sequence, voxel size, imaging processing software package, smooth kernel, statistical model, covariate, statistical threshold, peak coordinates, height of the peaks (  t   value or   z  -value, but a   P  -value is also useful), and their stereotactic reference space. \n\nTwo of the authors (LQS and PWZ) will independently perform the literature search, study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. Any inconsistencies will be discussed by consensus. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Main CBMA \n  \nThe main CBMA will be carried out using the SDM-PSI software package (version 6.21,  ). Its standard procedures include: calculation of the maps of the lower and upper bounds of possible effect sizes for each study separately based on the peak information using a specific FreeSurfer GM mask, full anisotropy\u200a=\u200a1, isotropic full width half maximum\u200a=\u200a20\u200amm, and voxel\u200a=\u200a2\u200amm; the mean analysis: estimation of the map of most likely effect size and its standard error based on the MetaNSUE algorithms,  conducting multiple imputations of the maps of effect size of the individual studies, meta-analysis of these maps using a standard random-effects model, and Rubin rules to pool the different meta-analyses resulting from the multiple imputations ; family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons using common permutation tests; and finally use of threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) in the statistical thresholding (  P  \u200a<\u200a.05, voxel extent \u226510). The details of these procedures have been extensively described in prior publications  and the SDM-PSI reference manual ( ). \n\n\n#### Subgroup CBMA \n  \nSubgroup CBMA will be conducted when the number of the datasets is sufficient (n\u200a\u2265\u200a10). Subgroup CBMA would be performed in clinical subtypes (such as PD patients without mild cognitive impairment and patients with mild cognitive impairment) and imaging methodology variables (including the datasets using 3.0 Tesla MRI scanners, slice thickness lower than 1\u200amm or voxel size lower than 1\u200a\u00d7\u200a1\u200a\u00d7\u200a1\u200amm , FreeSurfer software packages, FWHM of the smoothing kernel size of \u226415\u200amm, at least 1 covariates included in the statistical model, and thresholds corrected for multiple comparisons as well as those datasets performing quality control for imaging data and those not specifying it). \n\n\n#### Jackknife sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses \n  \nTo test the influence of each dataset on the pooled CBMA results, Jackknife sensitivity analysis will be performed by iteratively repeating the same analysis   K  \u200a\u2013\u200a1 times (  K  \u200a=\u200athe number of datasets included), discarding one dataset each time. \n\nWhere there is a significant cluster with a peak MNI coordinate reported in the CBMA, we will extract the information to derive standard heterogeneity statistics   I  , with   I  \u200a<\u200a50% indicating low heterogeneity. \n\nPublication bias of the significant cluster will be assessed with a test analogue to the Egger test (  P  \u200a<\u200a.05). \n\n\n#### Meta-regression analysis \n  \nMeta-regression analyses will be carried out to examine the potential effects of age, male sex, disease duration, UPDRS-III, HY stage, MMSE, and LEDD on the CBMA results. Statistical significance will be determined using the TFCE-based FWE corrected threshold (  P  \u200a<\u200a.05, voxel extent \u226510). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our best knowledge, this is the first CBMA of SBM studies to quantitatively identify consistent CTh alterations in PD using the latest algorisms of SDM-PSI  and following the recent guidelines and recommendations.  In addition to the main CBMA, we will conduct several supplementary analyses to test the robustness of the results, such as jackknife analyses, subgroup CBMA analyses, heterogeneity analyses, publication bias analyses, and meta-regression analyses. This CBMA will provide the latest evidence of CTh alterations in PD. \n\nPD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It has been suggested that cortical neurodegeneration emerged at stage 4 (associated with early phase motor dysfunction) and later stages according to the well-established brain pathologic staging scheme for PD proposed by Braak et al.  All the datasets included in the current CBMA enrolled patients with PD at their symptomatic stages, which indicate that cortical neurodegeneration should exist probably manifesting CTh alterations. If there was statistically significant consistence of CTh alterations with robustness in PD, we would discuss the importance of such findings involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms. If not, we would discuss the potential confounding factors the lead to this lack of consistence, such as small sample sizes, sample heterogeneity, and imaging methodological variations. We would further propose some recommendations to design robust CTh studies. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   JianGuo Zhong, ZhenYu Dai, PingLei Pan. \n\n Data curation:   PanWen Zhao, ZhongQuan Yi. \n\n Formal analysis:   HaiRong Ma, LiQin Sheng. \n\n Funding acquisition:   PingLei Pan. \n\n Investigation:   LiQin Sheng, PanWen Zhao, ZhongQuan Yi. \n\n Methodology:   Joaquim Radua, LiQin Sheng, PingLei Pan. \n\n Project administration:   LiQin Sheng, PingLei Pan. \n\n Resources:   PanWen Zhao, ZhongQuan Yi. \n\n Software:   Joaquim Radua, LiQin Sheng. \n\n Supervision:   JianGuo Zhong, ZhenYu Dai, PingLei Pan. \n\n Validation:   PingLei Pan. \n\n Visualization:   HaiRong Ma, LiQin Sheng. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   LiQin Sheng, PanWen Zhao, HaiRong Ma. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Joaquim Radua, JianGuo Zhong, ZhenYu Dai, PingLei Pan. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7402896, "text_md5": "3824f676f4a131780a6396944a70b6e5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 152], "journal": [153, 173], "publication_year": [175, 179], "title": [190, 229], "keywords": [243, 370], "abstract": [383, 2051], "body": [2060, 13147]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32756136, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000021403", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402896", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7402896"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402896\">7402896</a>", "list_title": "PMC7402896  Cortical thickness in Parkinson disease"}

One of these imaging biomarkers is neuromelanin (NM), whose integrity can be assessed from its contrast and volume. NM is found mainly in certain brain stem structures, namely, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the ventral tegmental area, and the locus coeruleus. Another major biomarker is brain iron, which often increases in concert with NM degeneration. These biomarkers have the potential to improve diagnostic certainty in differentiating between PD and other neurodegenerative disorders similar to PD, as well as provide a better understanding of pathophysiology. Mapping NM   in vivo   has clinical importance for gauging the premotor phase of PD when there is a greater than 50% loss of dopaminergic SNpc melanized neurons. As a metal ion chelator, NM can absorb iron. When NM is released from neurons, it deposits iron into the intracellular tissues of the SNpc; the result is iron that can be imaged and measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping. An increase of iron also leads to the disappearance of the nigrosome\u20101 sign, another neuroimage biomarker for PD. Therefore, mapping NM and iron changes in the SNpc are a practical means for improving early diagnosis of PD and in monitoring disease progression. In this review, we discuss the functions and location of NM, how NM\u2010MRI is performed, the automatic mapping of NM and iron content, how NM\u2010related imaging biomarkers can be used to enhance PD diagnosis and differentiate it from other neurodegenerative disorders, and potential advances in NM imaging methods. With major advances currently evolving for rapid imaging and artificial intelligence, NM\u2010related biomarkers are likely to have increasingly important roles for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in PD. \n\n## Evidence Level \n  \n1 \n\n\n## Technical Efficacy \n  \nStage 2 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nMRI offers a variety of imaging methods to produce quantitative measurements and spatial information about the human brain. Specifically, it can be used to provide exquisite structural imaging via high\u2010resolution T \u2010weighted (T1W) images, measurement of iron content through quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), neuromelanin (NM) mapping through NM\u2010MRI sequences, white matter tractography through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and network connections through resting\u2010state functional MRI. For achieving unmet needs of movement disorders research, one of the major areas of interest today is assessing the presence and integrity of NM (in terms of the contrast and volume) in the brain stem, mostly located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and locus coeruleus (LC). Another area of increasing interest is mapping the iron content in deep grey matter (DGM) structures. These two biomarkers go hand in hand as will be seen as the background for NM imaging unfolds. \n\nSince available treatments for PD are still only for symptomatic relief and fail to stop the neurodegeneration progress, early\u2010stage PD biomarkers are sought to better understand the pathophysiology, improve detection, and enable the application of timely clinical interventions. Furthermore, sensitive biomarkers of disease progression may speed up the process of developing disease modification therapies. The reason mapping NM is so important is that before PD motor symptoms emerge, there is already a greater than 50% loss of dopaminergic melanized neurons in the SNpc.  The earliest and greatest loss occurs in the nigrosome\u20101 (N1) territory, which is located in the caudal and mediolateral portions of the SNpc.  As a metal chelator, NM is thought to absorb iron, thereby protecting the dopaminergic neuron. If the NM can no longer function as an iron chelator (whether it is already fully saturated with iron and, hence, unable to absorb more of these ions, or for another reason), there may be release of previously intracellular iron in adjacent tissue.  Usually, neuronal death occurs at this stage since the NM can no longer protect the dopaminergic neurons. This deposited iron is in the form of ferritin and, therefore, becomes visible by MRI. Evidence shows that, concurrent with this loss, there is an increase of iron deposition in the SNpc in the PD brain.  Therefore, imaging NM and iron changes in the SNpc have proven to be valuable in facilitating the early diagnosis of PD and in monitoring disease progression. \n\nDuring this process, it also appears that, in the PD brain, the NM\u2010containing structures (SNpc and LC) and the entire SN (SNpc plus substantia nigra pars reticulata [SNpr]) undergo significant atrophy. ,  ,   Loss of the NM manifests as a loss of the N1 sign  and an increase of iron content. ,  ,   In PD patients, in the N1 territory where the earliest and greatest loss of NM occurs,  an increase in iron deposition is also found.  Recent studies have demonstrated NM loss and an increase in iron in the SNpc as valuable imaging biomarkers in PD.  We have found that these imaging measures (NM volume in the SN, N1 visualization, iron content in the entire SN, and the SN volume), when combined, provide a promising diagnostic biomarker for early\u2010stage PD patients.  Furthermore, neuronal loss in the ascending noradrenergic projections from the LC occurs in PD.  Degeneration of NM\u2010containing LC neurons precedes the loss of NM\u2010containing SN neurons in PD brain and may represent some of the earliest evidence for the development of PD.  Therefore, the need to enhance the tools for imaging the LC has become increasingly important. \n\nThe current approach of NM\u2010MRI is to use magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) radiofrequency (RF) pulses to suppress the surrounding macromolecule\u2010rich white matter with little effect on tissue with high\u2010water content such as the NM in the SN and LC.  These RF pulses have high specific absorption rates (which require a long repetition time) so that practical approaches to scanning are often carried out to measure only a small section of the brain.  Furthermore, imaging the NM in the SN and LC using a three\u2010dimensional (3D) gradient echo method requires multiple scans in which optimal parameters are imposed separately for the two territories.  The iron content of the SN is measured using QSM, which has become a well\u2010established method. QSM is typically processed from susceptibility\u2010weighted imaging (SWI) phase data and it is also used to assess N1 sign visualization. A recent study demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously imaging NM volume and iron content in PD patients. \n\nThe aim of this review is to discuss the following: 1) the function, location, and degeneration of NM in PD; 2) how it is visualized in cadaver brains and in MRI   in vivo  ; 3) how NM\u2010MRI is performed and why it works; 4) the evidence showing that NM\u2010MRI correlates with other measures of NM; 5) new approaches to mapping NM and creating a clinical tool for mapping NM automatically; 6) the ability of imaging biomarkers to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (HCs) and differentiate PD from other movement disorder patients; and 7) future directions of NM\u2010MRI in imaging PD. \n\nWe performed a literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar using multiple combinations of keywords including \u201cMRI,\u201d \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging,\u201d \u201cneuromelanin,\u201d \u201cNM,\u201d \u201cNM\u2010MRI,\u201d \u201cmagnetization transfer,\u201d \u201cMTC,\u201d and \u201cParkinson's disease\u201d. Only publications written in English with full\u2010text available (through open access and institutional library subscription) were reviewed. In addition, relevant publications identified from the bibliography of review articles, our reading of many papers in the field and other papers based on the best of our knowledge were also included in this comprehensive narrative review. The literature search was initially performed by N.H., Y.C., and E.M.H and subsequently reviewed by the other authors. \n\n## Neuromelanin, Iron, and the   N1   Sign in   PD  \n  \n### \nNeuromelanin and its Relationship With Iron Deposition\n \n  \nNM is an intraneuronal pigment, whose clumped granules are found exclusively in the brain. It is formed from catecholamines acted upon by a process of auto\u2010oxidation. It involves the incorporation of melanin into lipofuscin derived from lysosomes.  NM has a brown\u2010black appearance that is evident in an unmagnified inspection of brain tissue. While the process of regional generation of NM is not fully understood, it is known to play several roles in dopaminergic neurons.  Studies by Jan Purkinje first recognized NM in 1837.  The melanin leading to the creation of NM is a by\u2010product of dopamine synthesis. In SN and LC neurons, the overall content of NM increases with age. Thereafter, a decline in mean NM content has been found, probably due to the continuing loss of the most heavily pigmented neurons with increasing age.  In PD, which leads to a much accelerated loss of pigmented neurons compared to the normal aging process, measurements show an 80% reduction in neuronal count relative to healthy controls which was associated with a 15% reduction of tissue NM content.  When neurons die, their NM content can remain in the extra\u2010neuronal tissue or can be taken up in the cytoplasm of macrophages. \n\nThere is considerable evidence to link NM formation with exposure to oxidative free radicals. This evidence has also been one of the leading themes of research into the pathogenesis of PD, for which there is also evidence of oxidative stress and telling by\u2010products of this process such as peroxidated lipid structures and transformed molecules like 8\u2010hydoxy\u20107,8\u2010hydro\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyguanosine. In brain regions where NM is abundant\u2014the SN, LC, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve\u2014the most prominent loss of neurons is found in PD along with its characteristic tissue finding, the formation of Lewy bodies. One hypothesis for the abundant presence of NM in catecholamine synthesizing is that auto\u2010oxidation of catechol structures to quinones creates NM as a by\u2010product that is difficult for neurons to remove. NM accumulation may be physically disruptive to the health of such neurons since it damages them by inducing mitochondrial\u2010mediated apoptosis. However, this is not necessarily the entire story in PD, since nonpigmented neurons (such as those in the nucleus basalis of Meynert) also undergo prominent loss in PD.  The dorsal tier of the SN (which has the greatest content of NM in the SNpc), is a region that undergoes the earliest neuronal loss in PD.  However, the ventral tier of the SNpc demonstrates the most neuronal loss as a feature of PD progression. \n\nNM reduces ferric to ferrous iron and stores this iron as an oxyhydroxide (similar to how this occurs in ferritin). NM present in the SNpc/LC can have iron concentrations in the range of 150\u2013300/0\u201350\u2009\u03bcg iron/gm tissue wet weight as it accumulates from 20\u2009years to 80\u2009years of age  (and which appears to be predominantly in the form of H\u2010ferritin). The NM in the LC has about 10 times less iron relative to the SNpc.  The concentration of NM in the SNpc/LC ranges from 500\u20134000/1000\u20133000\u2009\u03bcg/g tissue wet weight over the same age range.  Given the concentrations of NM in the SNpc/LC and the iron concentrations in NM, one would expect the susceptibility of NM in vivo to be on the order of that in grey matter (50\u2009ppb or roughly 50\u2009\u03bcg iron/gm tissue).  In the human SN, it has been estimated that the amount of iron present as a NM\u2013Fe complex is 10%\u201320% of the total iron concentration present in the SN structure. \n\nTherefore, a loss of chelating function and a subsequent increase in   magnetically visible   iron could serve as a biomarker for NM dysfunction, particular the kind of change that might occur in a neurodegenerative disease such as PD. Intraneuronal NM can only be released following cell death of neurons and, hence, its measure would serve as a direct biomarker of cell damage. Once NM is in a depigmented state, it is thought to deposit its chelated iron (and likely other bound metals) into adjacent brain tissue. If this iron is in a reduced state, it can participate in the Fenton reaction and promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals facilitating regional oxidative stress. If the previously intracellular NM is released into the extracellular space, it can induce microglial activation. One outcome is triggering the production of nitric oxide, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. As ferritin is soluble, its iron content can be taken up systemically. In contrast, hemosiderin is insoluble and the iron will be stored there indefinitely. Assuming that the bound iron in NM behaves as in ferritin, then the depigmentation of that iron could lead to free iron or at least unprotected oxyhydroxides. The presence of abnormal reactive levels of ferrous iron may then lead to neuroinflammation through a variety of neurodegenerative processes. There are many studies ,   showing increased iron content in areas where NM is lost and also many papers using NM\u2010MRI showing loss of total NM volume for PD patients (see Table\u00a0  for details). \n\nThe SNpc NM content changes may play an important role as a biomarker for PD. It is thought that between 50% and 70% of the NM in the SNpc has depigmented before the appearance of PD motor symptoms.  The loss of dopaminergic neurons is most obvious in the caudal and ventro\u2010lateral regions of the SNpc in PD patients. Imaging biomarkers that allow for study of the etiology of disease have therapeutic implications and diagnostic importance and are a major goal in neurological research today, and MRI offers multiple biomarkers noninvasively at the sub\u2010millimeter level. \n\n\n###  SN   Subregions and the Distribution of Neuromelanin\n \n  \nThe SN can be subdivided into two major populations of neurons: the SNpc and the SNpr. Although merged into one another, the SNpc and the SNpr differ greatly in their anatomical configuration and their functional connections.  Differentiating between the SNpc and SNpr is not easily accomplished with conventional MRI or even from histopathological staining of CNS tissue given that clusters of SNpc dopaminergic neurons are deeply embedded within the SNpr. ,   The SNpr is located in the ventral portion of the SN and has abundant iron content. While the SNpc is situated more dorsally, its identification can also take advantage of differentiation from the SNpr by its lower iron content and the presence of NM (found in neurons that secrete dopamine). This differentiation can be demonstrated through NM\u2010MRI. For this, one of the more promising approaches to understanding the SN structure is using Calbindin D28k staining. Calbindin stains the protein in afferent fibers of the SN neuropil matrix (consisting of GABAergic striatonigral fibers). Calbindin staining also shows the same regions associated with the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase. A high\u2010resolution cadaver brain study  using Calbindin D28k staining and 7\u00a0T high\u2010resolution (0.67\u2009mm isotropic resolution) MRI validated the earlier demonstration of SN findings by Damier. ,   However, they found a mismatch between the Perl stained results and what is shown in T2*W images (i.e., the high iron content did not always match the T2*W images). The authors commented that the nigrosome territories are structures with low iron content, which is in concordance with the low susceptibility seen in these regions. \n\nNM is absent at birth and one paper suggests that it increases in concentration until the ninth decade of life.  However, Liu et al  reported that the increase in tissue NM concentration levels off in the seventh decade in the LC. Damier et al ,   showed that 60% of the NM is found within dopaminergic neurons of the nigral matrix (Calbindin positive) while the other 40% of NM is in the dopaminergic neurons associated with N1\u2013N5 territories. Damier and colleagues note that the loss of NM occurs in the following order from greater to lesser N1\u2009>\u2009N2\u2009>\u2009N4\u2009>\u2009N3\u2009>\u2009N5. The N1\u2013N4 structures lie predominantly below the rostral exiting of the third cranial nerve. Above this is N5 and some remnant of N4. N1 can cover as much as 5\u2009mm below this origin; that is, for MRI with a slice thickness of 1.34\u2009mm, it could appear in four to five caudal slices, for example. Note that the N1 can be posterior medial and be adjacent to the N3 posterior lateral in the more caudal slices. The N5 is seen predominantly posteriorly in the more rostral slices (Fig.\u00a0 ). Cell loss occurs throughout the SN, but the greatest extent of cell loss is found in the nigrosome territories. ,   Damier and colleagues note that, from 7 to 32\u2009years after onset, the cell loss is from 75% to 95%. Also, about 80% of the NM loss is from the SN and 20% in the SN pars dorsalis and SN pars lateralis. These observations are in line with reports from Gibb and Lees  and from others who have seen similar localization as the most vulnerable regions for NM loss. \n  \nThe anatomy of the SN and its five nigrosome territories shown on serial axial sections based on figure 1 from the article by Massey et al. \n  \n\n### \nVisualizing and Assessing the   N1   Sign With the Guidance of   NM\u2010MRI  \n  \nDamier as well as Gibb and Lees note that orientation is important in defining structures in the SN. ,  ,   That is certainly true from a 3D imaging perspective as well.  The different apparent shapes shown in Fig.\u00a0  demonstrate this problem. The geometry changes of the N1 shape are shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Consider the SN as a cylinder making an angle of 45\u00b0 to the   x  \u2010  z   axes and 45  to the   x  \u2010  y   axes as well. Then with a transverse cut through the cylinder the N1 sign will take on a truncated ellipsoidal shape (Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas if the imaging plane is perpendicular to the SN the N1 will look like a small circle and if the plane is parallel to the long axis of the SN it will look like a long oval shape (Fig.\u00a0 ). The situation is further complicated by the fact that the N1 can sometimes abu the edge of the SN and any iron that is there may not be observable (Fig.\u00a0 ). This lower iron content may require a much longer echo time to become visible. Depending on the amount of iron present, the N1 sign can be seen with echo times as low as 17.5\u00a0msec but in other cases, and particularly for younger individuals, it may require an echo time of 30\u2009msec. As the orientation of the imaging plane changes, the N1 sign can become more and more elongated until the plane runs along the long axis of the cylindrical\u2010like structure representing the SN shape (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n  \nCartoon illustration of the nigrosome 1 variants.  . \n    \n(a\u2013f) The N1 sign on QSM\u2010hpf data in a pseudo transverse plane with different degrees of rotation about the y\u2010axis for (\u221220\u00b0, \u221210\u00b0, 0\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 30\u00b0, respectively) from a 63\u2010year\u2010old healthy control. The 0\u00b0 angle represents the original scanning orientation along the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure line. The yellow arrows show that as the scanning plane changes from \u221220\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, the shape of the N1 becomes more elongated as the angle starts to match the angle to which the SN is tilted away from the transverse plane. \n  \nVisualizing the N1 sign is generally performed using a T2*W gradient echo sequence such as SWI. The usual SWI processing uses a mask on the high\u2010pass filtered phase images. This can enhance the presence of veins and iron but has the drawback that the phase is geometry dependent. Using QSM data instead to create a susceptibility mask, this problem can be avoided. ,   This method is referred to as true\u2010SWI (tSWI)  or susceptibility map\u2010weighted imaging (SMWI).  It is important to use the mask based on QSM of the high\u2010pass filtered phase data (denoted as QSM\u2010hpf), otherwise, since NM can also show iron content, the mask might indiscriminately suppress the signal from the N1 territory rendering the N1 sign invisible. One can use QSM, but sometimes these images show iron in the N1 region and when tSWI is created from these data, it can also suppress the signal from the N1 sign hiding it in a sea of dark signal. Using QSM of the high\u2010pass filtered phase images will remove some of the background signal and does a better job revealing the N1 sign more consistently. See Fig.\u00a0  for a demonstration of these concepts for a variety of movement disorders including rapid eye movement sleep\u2010behavioral disorder (RBD), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), tremor\u2010dominant (TD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) with predominant parkinsonism (MSA\u2010P) and cerebellar subtype (MSA\u2010C), essential tremor (ET), and a healthy control (HC) case. \n  \nThe presence of the N1 sign in different movement disorders. The five columns represent, in the following order: the original 30\u00b0 first echo NM image with a resolution of 0.67\u2009mm\u00a0\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm\u00a0\u00d7\u20091.34\u2009mm; the tSWI image as applied to the QSM data of the HPF phase from the first echo; the tSWI image as applied to the QSM data of the HPF phase of the third echo; the QSM data over three echoes using MEiSWIM; and the tSWI of the first echo using the original QSM data (with no HPF). Since the regions of NM can sometimes have non\u2010zero iron content, using the original QSM can obscure the presence of the N1 sign depending on how the tSWI filter is designed. Hence, we tend to use the tSWI of the QSM data of the HPF phase images for interpreting the presence of the N1 sign. Each row represents a different movement disorder except for the first row, which is for a HC. The ET, RBD, MSA\u2010C, MSA\u2010P and the PD\u2010TD either show bilateral or unilateral N1 signs. The PSP and PIGD cases show bilateral loss of the N1 sign and an atrophied SN. The N4 sign appears to be present in the PIGD case although no N1 sign appears to be present. The red boundaries are from the NM images and are superimposed on all the images to make it clear where the N1 sign must lie if it is to be considered part of the NM territory. \n  \nHowever, interpreting when the N1 sign is present is difficult from its shape alone.  Usually when the NM volume is normal and the contrast is high, the N1 sign is clearly present in long echo gradient echo methods like SWI (Fig.\u00a0 , HC and ET cases). Likewise, when the NM volume and contrast are low, there will be no N1 sign (Fig.\u00a0 , PSP case). We have seen a number of other variants when assessing the N1 sign; even in the presence of NM, there may be no N1 sign; low levels of NM do not guarantee absence of the N1 sign (Fig.\u00a0 , RBD and MSA\u2010P) and a small circular bright structure in the most ventral lateral aspect of the NM territory may represent N3 in the caudal slices. Both T2\u2010weighted spin echo  and T2W fluid attenuated inversion recover (FLAIR)  sequences have been shown to reveal the N1 sign, but not with as good contrast as that available with long echo gradient echo imaging.  In summary, the best way to validate the presence of the N1 sign is to use a variety of images, perhaps the best of which are the overlay of the NM boundaries on the tSWI data. \n\nAs a first pass, perhaps the most rapid way to review the data to visualize the N1 sign (or other nigrosome territories) is to have three types of images available: 1) the QSM of the high\u2010pass filter (HPF) data; 2) echo times ranging from 20\u2009msec to 30\u2009msec; and 3) tSWI. Superimposing the boundary of SNpc from the NM\u2010MRI on the SWI or tSWI of QSM of the HPF data will then reveal exactly what structure within the NM that is being visualized. We have noted that NM usually only appears clearly on the short TE NM\u2010MRI data but on occasion it can appear on a longer echo as well. The key take\u2010away point here is that the NM boundaries should be used to validate the interpretation of the N1 sign as first presented by He et al.  To appreciate more the variability of imaging type, Fig.\u00a0  shows the tSWI approach applied to different echoes and several other imaging modalities such as R2* and QSM maps. The R2* image shows the iron regions as bright. The QSM image looks quite different and shows a single medial leg on each SN. The application of tSWI to each of the first five echoes is revealing. Since there is no dephasing in the first echo, it is necessary to see the N1 sign. The advantage is that the NM is still very bright on the first echo and so the contrast between the iron containing regions and NM is enhanced. Note that the NM disappears as the echo times increase (due to the high R2* values in these regions). \n  \nThe role of different image types and different processing. Best visualizing the NM and iron content depend on the MT preparation used, the sequence type used and the choice of imaging parameters. In these data, we used a 3D MT prepared gradient echo SWI sequence with a resolution of 0.67\u2009mm\u00d71\u2009mm\u00d71.34\u2009mm. These data were collected on a Philips Ingenia scanner. The 30\u00b0 first echo MTC image in the upper left shows high SNR and visibility. The boundary of the NM is drawn here and copied to the first echo tSWI on the bottom left image. The N1 sign should appear within the NM boundary as is in fact the case. Yellow arrows are then used to highlight the N1 sign in all the lower row tSWI images. This individual has low iron content and so the N1 sign cannot be clearly seen until the fifth echo magnitude image (TE\u00a0=\u00a037.5\u00a0ms). Note the bright region of the N1 is clearly seen even in the early echoes of the tSWI data. \n  \nWhen there is sufficient signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (SNR), the higher resolution imaging methods ,   such as 0.67\u2009mm isotropic or 0.8\u2009mm isotropic can potentially reveal the different nigrosomes.  The N2\u2013N5 nigrosomes are more poorly visualized than the N1 in healthy controls.  Using NM\u2010MRI and tSWI templates, Sung et al  showed that the N1 and N2 signs were separately affected in early\u2010stage idiopathic PD patients. Langley et al  used high in\u2010plane resolution (0.39\u2009mm\u00a0\u00d7\u20090.39\u2009mm) NM\u2010MRI with an R2* map to create a voxel\u2010based morphometry representation of the N1 and N2 signs. Increasing the resolution and SNR with the appropriate sequences may indeed help in the future to identify all of the nigrosome signs in a clinically defined imaging protocol. \n\n\n###  LC   Structure and the Distribution of   NM  \n  \nThere are several recent reviews ,   that provide an excellent overview of the role of NM in the LC, particularly the 2019 review by Betts et al  discussing noradrenergic dysfunction in the LC as a biomarker for neurodegeneration. Based on early postmortem studies,  each of the human LC nuclei is approximately 14.5\u2009mm long and 2\u20132.5\u2009mm in diameter (therefore, with a volume of from 45\u2009mm  to 71\u2009mm ). The paired LC structures are localized 1\u2009mm anterior to the fourth ventricle, 3\u2009mm left and right from the midline, and centered 14\u201321\u2009mm above the ponto\u2010medullary junction. LC volumes described in more recent NM\u2010MRI studies show inconsistencies with one another and their volumes are much less than reported in the postmortem study (reported to be from 11.4\u2009mm  to 30\u2009mm  in healthy controls ,  ,   and 8.2\u2009mm  in a PD cohort ). This underestimate may have arisen from the limited number of thick slices in which the LC has been MR\u2010visible. \n\nIn studies of LC NM content and LC NM signal intensity across the lifespan, an inverted U\u2010shaped pattern has been reported.  This pattern also has been replicated in postmortem tissue studies  and NM\u2010MRI studies.  The increase and decrease of NM content may reflect increasing pigmented granule content due to continuous noradrenaline production during adulthood and preceding cell death. In PD and other neuro\u2010degenerative disorders, there is clearance of previously intracellular NM, also contributing to the down\u2010direction arm of the U\u2010shaped curve after the onset of neurological disease. ,   Therefore, studies of LC NM content need to take into account age\u2010related effects when evaluating different clinical populations. \n\nSome published studies ,   found a reduction in LC NM contrast in PD patients independent of the analytic method used (voxel approaches or probabilistic maps). In these studies, the reduction displayed a distinct spatial pattern, with the middle\u2010caudal portion being more affected than the rostral part.  However, no significant correlation was observed between LC NM contrast and noradrenaline transporter density in PD patients.  A recent study investigated the association of LC structural changes with nonmotor clinical symptomatology in PD and found that there is a spatially heterogeneous degeneration of LC among PD patients. There was an association between regional structural degeneration and individual expressions of PD nonmotor symptoms (such as orthostatic dysregulation or apathy).  Another group found a significant positive correlation between LC NM contrast and the extent of motor improvement after levodopa administration.  They concluded that evaluating LC NM parameters using NM\u2010MRI might be predictive of levodopa responsiveness in PD. \n\n\n\n## Technical Perspectives of   NM\u2010MRI  \n  \n###  NM\u2010MRI   Sequence Types\n \n  \nNM in the SNpc and LC was first observed by Sasaki and colleagues as hyperintense regions on 2D multislice, high in\u2010plane resolution T1W images acquired with a turbo\u2010spin\u2010echo (TSE) sequence, now referred to as NM\u2010sensitive MRI or NM\u2010MRI.  The initial study reported significantly reduced NM contrast in the SNpc and LC regions in PD patients.  The contrast in NM\u2010MRI is thought to be associated mainly with the T1\u2010shortening effect when NM is combined with minerals (particularly, iron and copper). What has led to the NM\u2013iron complex being highlighted on T1W images (acquired with TE/TR\u00a0=\u00a014\u2009msec/600\u2009msec at 3\u00a0T) relative to the surrounding white matter or iron\u2010free gray matter is still not clear. The inherent magnetization transfer (MT) effects caused by the high radio\u2010frequency (RF) radiation within a TR and/or a spectral presaturation rf pulse are thought to synergistically contribute to NM image contrast. The 2D TSE sequence employs a high in\u2010plane resolution of less than 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009mm , with 10 axial slices of 2.5\u2009mm thick slices collected perpendicular to the fourth ventricle. The number of slices were sufficient to cover territory from the rostral slice of the SN caudally to the LC. Other parameters contributing to the NM contrast\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (CNR) include a single concatenation, an echo train length of 2 and avoiding the use of parallel imaging acceleration.  Drawbacks of this particular sequence include the high specific absorption rate (SAR) level that would limit the number of slices. Other negative factors include the highly anisotropic voxel size (which impairs the accuracy of the 3D visualization of the SN and LC), volume measurements for the SN and LC, very poor SNR (requiring multiple acquisitions) and very long scan times (>10\u2009minutes), which are prone to motion artifacts when imaging PD patients. \n\nAiming at achieving shorter scanning times, Nakane and colleagues verified the NM contrast in the SNpc and LC on a 1.5\u00a0T scanner using a 3D gradient\u2010recalled\u2010echo (GRE) sequence and an off\u2010resonance MT pulse preparation.  The latter study confirmed that the MT effect induced by the off\u2010resonance MT pulse has the most contribution to the observed NM contrast.  They also tried to optimize the nominal flip angle of the off\u2010resonance MT pulse for achieving better contrast of the LC and reported that a 500  MT pulse gave improved LC contrast compared to the 360  MT pulse (though it yielded a higher SAR and a longer scan time).  Further efforts optimizing the nominal flip angle of the off\u2010resonance MT pulse were carried out by Chen and colleagues.  Their study compared the MTC in the SN and LC territories acquired from three sequences: the original 2D TSE sequence, and two 2D GRE sequences with either a nominal 300\u00b0 MT pulse or a 300\u00b0 MT pulse applied to the central part of k\u2010space. They concluded that both the GRE sequences were able to mitigate the SAR burden and provide a standardized protocol to image the SN and LC simultaneously. A subsequent study by Trujillo and colleagues employed synthetic melanin\u2013iron complex phantoms at different concentrations to mimic the human SN for a systemic investigation of the contrast mechanisms in NM\u2010MRI.  They found that the iron\u2010free melanin phantom produced a negligible MT effect, and the melanin\u2013iron complexes at different concentrations did not alter the observed macromolecular water to free water pool\u2010size\u2010ratio as measured by the quantitative MT method. Instead, the T1 and T2 shortening caused by the melanin\u2013iron complex contributed the most to the observed MT contrast.  This report was followed by an in vivo study from the same group,  in which they observed a higher water pool\u2010size\u2010ratio of the SNpc in PD patients compared with those in HCs. However, their results need to be considered preliminary given their small sample size. A further study on healthy controls also observed a significantly lower LC water pool\u2010size\u2010ratio compared with surrounding brain tissue.  These quantitative MT\u2010derived observations are consistent with studies by Watanabe and colleagues that indicate NM\u2010MRI contrast in the LC is associated with high water content.  We have further validated this finding by showing the high contrast of NM using low FAs (in which T1 does not play a significant role ) and in mapping actual water content (which also reveals NM ). \n\nIn line with the needs of 1) quantifying iron deposition in the SN, 2) assessing the N1 sign, and 3) measuring NM contrast and volume in the SNpc and LC to systematically evaluate PD at the early stage, 3D multiecho GRE sequences have received considerable emphasis. ,   Liu and colleagues optimized the NM contrast in the SN and LC as a function of flip angles using a multiecho 3D GRE sequence with MT preparation. Their method used an on\u2010resonance 1\u20102\u20101 set of binominal RF pulses.  The study concluded that the optimal NM contrast in the SN was achieved at a flip angle lower than the Ernst angle of the tissues (15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0), while the optimal LC contrast was achieved at a slightly higher flip angle with minor T1 weighting (20\u00b0\u201325\u00b0).  Meanwhile, the MT prepared multiecho GRE acquisition makes it viable to simultaneously measure the NM content of the SN and the LC from the short echo time\u2010derived MTC images. Iron deposition levels and the N1 evaluation in the SN could be extracted from the SWI and QSM data derived from the long echo times. A subsequent clinical study by He and colleagues  used the 3D multiecho GRE method to achieve a better diagnostic performance by combining the NM volume, SN volume, iron content, and the N1 sign in differentiating PD patients from healthy controls. The 3D GRE\u2010based NM\u2010MRI methods benefit from the lower SAR level and larger coverage than is possible with the 2D TSE based methods. Drawbacks of 3D GRE\u2010based NM\u2010MRI methods are mainly associated with susceptibility artifacts and blood flow induced artifacts, which can be mitigated by using a minimum echo time with proper flow compensation. \n\nIn summary, the majority of studies ,  ,   have used the 2D TSE\u2010based sequences for NM\u2010MRI, with or without adding a MT preparation pulse (see Table\u00a0  for imaging parameters). In addition, 2D GRE sequences with MT preparation, ,  ,  ,   3D single\u2010echo GRE sequences with MT preparation, ,   and 3D multiecho GRE sequences with on\u2010resonance MT preparation ,   have also been used for NM\u2010MRI. A direct comparison of 2D TSE sequences with and without MT preparation, and a 3D multiecho GRE sequence is shown in Fig.\u00a0 . The detailed imaging parameters of these sequences are listed in Table\u00a0 . Briefly, all three scans employed an in\u2010plane resolution of 0.43\u00a0\u00d7\u20090.86\u2009mm . Sixteen slices with a thickness of 3\u2009mm were acquired in 6\u00a0minutes 49\u2009seconds for the 2D TSE sequence without MT preparation, and 9\u00a0minutes 36\u2009seconds with MT preparation, which had a longer TR. In contrast, 72 slices with a thickness of 1.5\u2009mm were acquired in 6\u00a0minutes 20\u2009seconds for the 3D GRE sequence. The MT pulse is a vendor\u2010provided MT option, which is a 10\u2009msec single lobe sinc pulse with Gaussian apodization, 500  nominal flip angle, and 1.2\u00a0kHz off\u2010resonance. The three scans shown in Fig.\u00a0  provided comparable NM contrast in the SN and LC. One major advantage of the 3D GRE sequences is that they can provide co\u2010registered SWI and QSM data as well as MRA data comparable with the clinical time\u2010of\u2010flight MRA acquired separately. Overall, with the larger in\u2010plane voxel size, the SNR and CNR in the 3D GRE MT prepared data are higher than those from the limited slice TSE scans. The fast 3D imaging with larger coverage makes it easier to image all DGM structures rapidly, a valuable property for imaging PD patients. \n  \nA direct comparison of 2D TSE and 3D GRE NM\u2010MRI sequences for a 41\u2010year\u2010old man. Images (a)\u2013(c) in the left panel were from the 2D TSE sequence without an MT pulse. Images (d) and (e) in the middle panel were from the 2D TSE sequence with an MT pulse. Images (g)\u2013(o) in the right panel were from the 3D multiecho GRE sequence. All three sequences show the NM reasonably well although the data are still somewhat noisy (a, d, g) and LC (b, e, h) territories. Of note, images (g) and (h) were averaged over two slices to match the slice thickness in the TSE sequences. The reformatted coronal view (c, f, i) showed that the 3D GRE sequence had a sharper depiction of the LC structure given by thin slice 3D acquisition. In addition, the 3D GRE sequence was also used to generate SWI (j and l), QSM (k), and MRA (m\u2013o) images. Data were acquired using a Siemens VERIO 3\u00a0T scanner with a 32\u2010channel head coil. Detailed imaging parameters are listed in Table\u00a0 . \n  \n\n### \nImaging Neuromelanin at   7\u00a0T  \n  \nWhile the vast majority of NM imaging studies in PD patients have been conducted using 3\u00a0T MRI scanners, recent developments and applications using 7\u00a0T have been able to show NM contrast in the SN and in the LC using high\u2010resolution imaging. ,  ,  ,   There is no clinical study that directly compares the diagnostic performance of NM loss in the SN using 3\u00a0T and 7\u00a0T scanners on the same patient population. Independent studies from 3\u00a0T  and 7\u00a0T  reported comparable AUC values in differentiating PD patients from healthy controls using the SN volumes measured from the MTC and QSM data. This is not surprising given that the size of the SN and the contrast mechanisms of these data ensure good contrast and reliable measures at 3\u00a0T. However, the LC is much smaller than the SN. With increased imaging SNR, 7\u00a0T has the potential to provide a much better depiction of the rod\u2010like LC structure.  Using 7\u00a0T NM\u2010MRI, it is possible to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of LC contrast  and regional NM loss in the LC,  which are thought to be related to nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. \n\n\n###  NM  \u2010Containing Structures, Segmentation, and Template Mapping in the Brainstem\n \n  \nThe ability for measurement of NM in the SN or LC and iron in the SN biomarkers to be of practical value will depend on the development of automated processing methods. Today, this option comes in the form of template mapping in which a structure and its boundaries can be defined in template space based on a single high\u2010quality dataset. ,  ,  ,  ,   Ideally, data from other individuals of that class (healthy control or patient type) are then mapped to this original dataset and a probability map created from which one can define the extent of the structure. In turn, this template can be mapped to the MNI template and the user can have access to Talairach coordinates. In the early implementations, the atlases created were based on T1 and or T2 data. ,   Today, mapping NM and iron in the midbrain use NM and QSM or R2* data to generate the templates. The boundaries from these templates are then used to map out the SNpc as the overlap between the NM contrast structure and the whole SN. Generally, the template approaches reported so far used NM\u2010MRI for SNpc  or QSM data for the SN. ,   Recall that hyperintense signal from the MTC N\u2010MMRI\u00a0sequences\u00a0is related to the SNpc and VTA. \n\nMost early studies used manual tracing methods. Subsequently, some semi\u2010automated approaches were applied. ,   More recently further attempts at full automation have been reported. ,   Automated approaches can potentially overcome the limitations of differences between raters and also dramatically reduce the time to process the data. Segmenting the SN and NM can be performed algorithmically or by using artificial intelligence (AI). The former usually involves a clear set of rules while the latter is done ad hoc through a deep learning process, extracting a set of critical features. This process, in practice, could be similar to some of the algorithmic input. Several AI\u2010related papers have been published recently on extracting DGM structures (including the SN). ,  \n\nCreating a template from QSM or T2* data alone cannot separate the SNpc and SNpr because there are no apparent boundaries in these images to differentiate them. However, combined with a template from NM data, the overlap region can be considered to be the SNpc. The remaining region not in the overlap from the NM template can be assumed to be the VTA. Segmenting the VTA has also been of interest in studying fiber pathways with DTI where templates of the VTA have been used, although results have been quite variable. ,  \n\nOne of the issues with algorithmic methods is setting the contrast threshold above which the structure will be assessed. This can lead to large variations in volumes.  AI methods will also depend on the training of the data and their accuracy could be susceptible to how the training is carried out. A recent neural net approach shows much larger than expected NM volumes.  Another major issue for comparing data across sites or even over time in the same scanner is normalization. One way to handle this problem is to use a normalized contrast (i.e., the difference between the NM region and an adjacent structure, normalized by the signal of the adjacent structure). \n\nEvaluating the data from a given individual after the template has been created involves mapping that individual's data to the template, picking up the boundaries, mapping them back to the original space, and then fine tuning the boundaries.  This approach allows finer details to be found. For example, in some high\u2010resolution data of the NM, fingers can be seen projecting into the crus cerebri. Also fine tuning the boundaries requires high SNR. Therefore, for mapping of the NM in the SN, a slightly lower resolution (which also requires less scan time) will provide much better SNR. For example, reducing the resolution from 0.44\u2009\u00d7\u20090.44\u2009mm  to 0.67\u2009\u00d7\u20090.67\u2009mm  will reduce the scan time to 2/3 the original scan time and increase the SNR by a factor of 1.5 to 2 (depending if the higher resolution requires doubling the bandwidth or not). Imaging movement disorder patients is often difficult, so a rapid scan time can be very useful. Also, being able to extract both the NM and iron content from a single scan makes it possible to use each of these variables in clinical assessment and avoids the need for co\u2010registration between different types of scans. One recent approach used a single MTC scan of 5\u2009minutes to accomplish this goal.  In the end, mapping the NM may still prove challenging for any of these methods because the NM varies in shape for some brain diseases and the SN is subject to atrophy. \n\n\n\n##  NM\u2010MRI   Applications in   PD   and Atypical Parkinsonism \n  \n###  PD   Diagnosis and Clinical Correlation\n \n  \nNM\u2010MRI studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of NM biomarkers' ability to discriminate between HCs and patients with PD were summarized in a recent review.  The results showed a pooled sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval: 86%\u201392%) and a pooled specificity of 83% (95% confidence interval: 76%\u201388%) using NM\u2010MRI to diagnose PD. Using the receiver\u2010operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area\u2010under\u2010the\u2010curve (AUC) of the ROC values for the NM complex volume, the total SN volume, the SN iron content, and the N1 sign were 0.960, 0.788, 0.740, and 0.891, respectively.  Combining the NM complex volume with the N1 sign led to an AUC value of 0.983.  The combination of SN volume, signal intensity, and fractional anisotropy in the NM\u2010sensitive substantia nigra gave a diagnostic accuracy (0.93) for PD. \n\nA longitudinal study found that the total area and contrast ratio of the NM\u2010prominent SN were both negatively correlated with disease duration in PD patients.  Unlike that in HCs, the volume of the SNpc progressively reduced for increasing disease severity in PD patients. Furthermore, NM signal changes appeared to start in the posterolateral motor areas of the SN and then progressed to more medial regions.  This study also showed that the NM SNR in the bilateral posterolateral SN was significantly negatively correlated with the MDS\u2010UPDRS\u2010III OFF score in the early PD cohort, which is consistent with many other studies. ,  ,   Therefore, NM\u2010sensitive MRI could be a neuroimaging biomarker to monitor the nigral degeneration and disease progression in PD. Biondetti et al also investigated the concomitant spatial changes in SNpc dopamine\u2010iron, dopamine\u2010NM and NM\u2010iron in PD patients and found that the temporal ordering of dopaminergic changes progressively involved first the sensorimotor, and next the associative and limbic striatal and nigral regions.  However, NM volume does not appear to correlate with SN volume loss, suggesting that SN atrophy is on a pathophysiological path different from that which causes NM loss. \n\nIn PD patients, the SN NM pathology correlates with motor dysfunction, whereas the NM pathology in the LC is related to cognitive impairment. Therefore, NM measures of the LC could serve as a correlate of another important clinical measure of PD progression, cognitive dysfunction in PD patients.  Imaging biomarkers of nonmotor features in PD are a major unmet need for clinical trials research. Investigations of PD brains and incidental Lewy body disease have shown that the intraneuronal\u2010synuclein burden in the LC occurs earlier and can be more severe than the dopaminergic neuron loss in the same patient's SNpc.  Therefore, monitoring the contrast ratio of the LC (LC\u2010CR) and area of the LC may be useful in evaluating the component of PD that is related to cognitive dysfunction. It may also be useful in evaluating mild cognitive impairment.  Studies have shown that the LC can be linked to many cognitive functions such as short term and working memory, learning, attention, and sleep architecture (especially rapid eye movement sleep\u2010related behavior).  Consequently, changes in the LC NM might correlate with a loss in cognitive abilities with normal ageing or in the context of PD.  Complicating the interpretation of these measures are major interindividual differences found with LC visualization and volume determinations observed across populations of healthy subjects.  Advanced techniques and multisite, large sample size studies are required to evaluate the reliability in measuring LC degeneration in PD using NM\u2010MRI. \n\n\n### \nDifferential Diagnosis Between   PD   and Other Movement Disorders Using NM  MRI  \n  \nRecent advances in multimodal MRI techniques including iron and NM\u2010based sequences allow for a precise characterization of the brain stem damage in PD and contribute to good classification between PD and HCs. However, the more practical challenge clinically is to differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonism. Among these, the most challenging differentiation scenarios pertain to PSP and the Parkinsonian and cerebellar variants of MSA. Some classic features of regional brain atrophy from routine MRI sequences can enhance diagnostic capabilities in MSA, but these changes occur sometimes years into the development of this disorder.  The same can be said regarding PSP. \n\nPrevious studies have shown that iron content in the SN predominantly reflects the dopaminergic degeneration and disease progression in PD ,   but does not allow for differentiation between PD and MSA patients or between different MSA variants.  However, compared with PD, higher iron deposition was found in the putamen in MSA patients,  while significantly increased susceptibility values were found in the RN, STN and medial region of the SN in PSP patients.  Concerning the differential diagnosis between PD and atypical parkinsonism's using NM\u2010MRI, a previous small sample size study concluded that the contrast ratios of NM in the ventral\u2013lateral SNc was lower in PD (  n  \u00a0=\u00a030) and MSA\u2010P (  n  \u00a0=\u00a010) groups than in those with PSP syndrome (PSPS:   n  \u00a0=\u00a013) and control groups (  n  \u00a0=\u00a022). The LC contrast ratio was lower in the PD group than in the other groups. The sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 90% for PD vs. MSA\u2010P, 63%\u201388% and 77%\u201392% for PD vs. PSPS, and 80% and 85% for MSA\u2010P vs. PSP. \n\nOne group showed that significant loss of NM and the N1 sign in the de novo PD group than those in the ET and control groups.  Another study reported that ET patients showed no NM difference in the SN when compared with HCs using NM\u2010MRI.  (See, for example, Figure\u00a0  for the ET case.) These findings suggest that NM\u2010MRI may serve as a biomarker to differentiate between PD and ET patients. \n\nAs for patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the NM intensity of the SN is lower than that in HCs, which is consistent with the autopsy results that NM\u2010containing neurons can be lost in patients with DLB. \n\n\n###  NM\u2010MRI   Application in   PD   Subtypes and Prodromal   PD  \n  \nThe clinical symptoms of PD are quite heterogenous and so are the pathological changes underlying different PD subtypes.  It has been reported that PIGD patients showed significantly lower NM CNR in the lateral SN compared to TD patients. They found a diagnostic accuracy of 79% (sensitivity 76.5% and specificity 78.6%) in differentiating PIGD from TD patients.  This is consistent with another PD subtype group study  showing that NM\u2010MRI has a potential diagnostic value to discriminate the clinical PD subtypes (which are important in the study of PD progression and disability). \n\nThe NM\u2010MRI measures have also been evaluated in prodromal PD cohorts, which are RBD patients. Sommerauer et al  reported that the NM in the LC decreased in patients with PD patients with RBD as compared to PD patients lacking RBD. This is consistent with another study's findings that found NM intensity reduced more markedly in PD patients with RBD behavior than those lacking it.  A subsequent study from the same researchers showed reduced NM signal in the LC/subcoeruleus complex of the patients with RBD but lacking Parkinsonism, suggesting that this complex is affected in the purely RBD subjects to the same degree as it is affected in PD.  These results are in agreement with the findings of widespread noradrenergic impairment in RBD, as detected with noradrenaline transporter imaging.  These studies also support the potential of NM MRI as an early marker of PD in the prodromal phase (which often involved RBD or impaired olfaction, or both). \n\nIn summary, a majority of studies have investigated the value of NM\u2010MRI and the N1 sign in PD and in related movement disorders. In brief, NM\u2010MRI could potentially provide useful disease state biomarkers for clinical trials in the preclinical and prodromal stages and also be used to monitor the progression beginning in early\u2010stage (recently diagnosed or minimally symptomatic) PD.  However, biomarkers derived from NM\u2010MRI alone do not seem to be able to reliably distinguish PD from the atypical Parkinsonian disorders, nor will it be sufficient to monitor the progression in patients with moderate to late\u2010stage PD. The reliability and consistency of the NM\u2010related biomarkers need to be further investigated in multisite studies in the future. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions \n  \nThere is considerable ongoing effort in the MR field to find useful imaging biomarkers for PD and related neurodegenerative disorders. It has been found that either using NM volumes and/or the N1 sign (which also is clearly related to the presence of NM) a high sensitivity and specificity can be found for differentiating PD patients from HCs. However, to differentiate between the various Parkinsonian movement disorders will likely require the inclusion of iron measures throughout the DGM. In order to provide definitive assessment of novel biomarkers, hundreds if not thousands of cases should be studied across sites. This is only possible if some level of technical standardization can be reached. One such approach of standardizing the measure NM and iron is STAGE (strategically acquired gradient echo) imaging. ,   With this technique, it has been possible to show reproducibility across sites and across manufacturers for the measures of NM and iron content.  Once this type of standardized imaging approach has become adopted, this will create a big data environment, which will benefit from the use of AI in comprehensively evaluating the data. Machine learning and radiomics may be the way of the future in investigating a broad variety of features to differentiate PD from other forms of neurodegeneration.  Finally, new technical developments in imaging NM and iron simultaneously are promising. New methods such as spin density\u2010weighted 3D gradient echo imaging  that do not require an MTC pulse and rely on the increased water content of the NM (Fig.\u00a0 ) or faster imaging methods such as wave SWI  to image the N1 sign with longer echo times (Fig.\u00a0 ) open the door to more practical imaging of movement disorder patients where motion can be a problem. With a concerted, collaborative effort, the radiology and neurology research communities have the opportunity to incorporate these methods in large collaborative studies to begin to address these issues, which are significantly important for the care of patients. \n  \nVisualizing the NM without an MTC pulse. Top row, NM in the LC: (a) From the 6\u00b0 STAGE data, the spin density\u2010weighted short TE (7.5\u00a0msec) is good enough to visualize the NM because the surrounding CSF is sufficiently suppressed and the high water content of the LC makes it visible.

The same neurons activated during observation are those recruited during the same movements and actions. Hence the mirror system plays a central role in observing and executing movements.

An integrated multidisciplinary assessment (neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neuropsychological) was used for the selection of the PD candidate for the neuroimaging experimental acquisition.

If the observed choreic movement becomes part of the observer\u2019s motor repertoire experience, mirror neurons might activate stimulating affective empathy and making the understanding of movement an own proper body experience (cognitive embodiment). \n\n\n## Main Lessons \n  \nOur study sheds light on a possible use of complex action observation to improve or slow the deterioration of motor abilities and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD patients. Indeed, the modulation of the neural area involved in complex action observation could be considered a promising target for neuro-rehabilitative intervention mediated by the elicitation of the MNS. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHumans are eminently social animals whose life depends on the ability to infer what others do, understanding intentions and interpreting feelings. With the discovery of the mirror neuron system (MNS), it has been shown that people do not understand others only and exclusively with cognitive associative neuronal circuits \u2013 as had been believed so far \u2013 but that a more immediate, direct, visceral understanding of the relationship between individuals exists and it is linked to particular resonance circuits \u2013 formed precisely by the MNS ( ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nIndeed, recognition of other\u2019s goal-directed motor behavior mediated by brain processes of internal simulation is the core function of the MNS: mirror neurons \u201cunderstand\u201d before being stimulated by higher cognitive circuits according to the classic scheme: perception \u2192 cognition \u2192 movement ( ;  ;  ). Traditionally, this algorithm was reserved to the associative areas of the neocortex that translated sensory information into motor commands ( ;  ). MNS is already recruited when a subject sees a motor action ( ). The only condition is that for the observer the action is part of his motor repertoire. If the observed action is not part of the observer\u2019s motor repertoire, mirror neurons do not activate and the understanding of movement does not become a bodily experience and, therefore, its understanding can only take place through a rational pathway ( ). \n  \nHumans are \u201cnatural born imitators.\u201d MNS translates visual perception of another\u2019s gesture into stimulation of this same gesture in the observer\u2019s brain, specifically in the motor and premotor cortices. Slight activation occurs in neurons and muscles, training the brain in movement. \n  \nConsidering the above, the existence of the MNS provides for the existence of a phenomenon of \u201cimmediate neuronal resonance\u201d because the observer recruits the same neuronal areas that are activated in the brain of those who perform the action ( ;  ;  ;  ). MNS properties \u2013 while being innate \u2013 rely on personal motor repertoire and can be modified by experience ( ,  ). Furthermore, mirror neurons connecting directly to the subcortical structures of emotion can be decisive in \u201cempathy\u201d ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). As expressed by  , the MNS \u00ab  appear to be the evolutionary key to our attainment of full culture for the way in which they allow humans to adopt each other\u2019s point of view and empathize with one another  \u00bb (2011: xv-xvi; chapter 4). The MNS discovery has thus made possible a new conception of the motor system, also opening the way to the neurophysiological and neuroimaging investigation of issues that had previously been the exclusive preserve of the Humanities. Using these techniques, it has been shown that the mirror system consists of two large regions: the inferior parietal lobule and the ventral premotor area, to which the inferior frontal gyrus is partially associated ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Today, the MNS activation can therefore be considered a sort of bioindicator of human competences. \n\nAn interesting problem was to shed light on the relationship among MNS recruitment, the personal motor repertoire and social competences, during the observation of complex behaviors like the choreutical arts. In a famous neuroimaging study by   the intensity of the activation of the MNS in classical ballet dancers, capoeira experts and people who had never danced was examined. The aim of the research was to establish whether the brain areas pertaining to the MNS were activated differently according to the subjects\u2019 dance experience. The authors suggested that the MNS \u00ab  integrates observed actions of others with an individual\u2019s personal motor repertoire and suggest that the human brain understands actions by motor simulation  \u00bb ( ; page 1243). In a second research,   found \u00ab  greater premotor, parietal, and cerebellar activity when dancers viewed moves from their own motor repertoire, compared to opposite-gender moves that they frequently saw but did not perform  \u00bb (page 1905). The authors concluded that humans understand motorically actions not only from a visual point of view ( ). Indeed, the most important function of the mirror system seems to be detection of motor patterns and recognition of the intentions of others\u2019 actions ( ;  ). \n\nThe MNS is sensitive to neurodegeneration ( ). A progressive alteration in the posterior-anterior direction and associated with initial compensatory mechanisms has been suggested in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease continuum. Considering frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MNS abnormalities seem to be able to explain language and inter-subjectivity deficits. MNS could be altered also in PD. However, motor and cognitive performances seem to be supported by MNS hyperactivation in the early stages of the disease ( ). To analyze neurodegenerative diseases considering MNS findings allows to better understand the clinical manifestations and attempt new rehabilitation approaches ( ;  ). \n\nAlternative therapeutic interventions \u2013 such as dance therapy \u2013 are based on the link between MNS, empathy, motor, and social skills. Dance therapy opens to emotional listening through the movement of the body, stimulating a creative process that favors the improvement of relational dynamics, existential enrichment, and patient resilience. Dance therapy is a non-invasive, simple treatment option, which promotes gait, motor function, cognition, and mental symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) ( ;  ). Importantly, it is beneficial in improving executive functions ( ), the damage of which has previously been associated with dyskinesias-reduced-self-awareness ( ;  ,  ;  ) and impulse control disorder ( ). In such cases, even if patients do not complain about involuntary movements, they can have a deleterious effect on their own motor repertoire. \n\nThere is increasing evidence supporting the use of complementary therapies based on action observation as means to potentially benefit PD ( ). Nonetheless, little is known about the mirror system in PD. Some evidence for altered brain activation in mirror neuron areas has been previously found ( ;  ), but considering only Theory of Mind. The first endpoint of our single case was to start exploring our hypothesis on involvement of MNS components in PD. We aimed to have supporting information about (1) the neural correlates associated with patients\u2019 visual participation in the choreic arts; (2) the possible value of action observation in clinical practice. Our secondary endpoint was to evaluate the feasibility of the functional neuroimaging research protocol on patients with movement disorders \u2013 modifying where necessary acquisition parameters and procedures \u2013 prior to starting experimenting on a larger sample. \n\nSpecifically, we reproduce here the paradigm presented by   since it is suitable for verifying possible alteration of the \u201cproprioceptive-control mirroring effect\u201d in chronic motor impairment. Importantly, this approach was attempted for the first time in Literature on a patient with movement disorders. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nWe started recruiting patients at the Center for the Study of Movement Disorders, Department of Neuroscience, University of Turin, Italy. The selection procedure was conducted among the patients taken in charge by the Unit for possible access to advanced therapy, in terms of deep brain stimulation intervention ( ;  ,  ). Twenty patients were considered as possible candidates. \n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nInclusion criteria were: (a) A good clinical response to levodopa with the presence of peak-of-dose dyskinesias and wearing off or on-off phenomena; (b) Stable treatment regimen for at least 6 months and aimed at treating each patient optimally; (c) at least elementary school education (d) Mini Mental State Examination ( ) uncorrected score \u226527 as per medico-legal evaluation guidelines ( ) and in order to include only a cognitively non-impaired subject ( ;  ,  ); (d) Willing to participate in the study and acquisition of a written informed consent. \n\nExclusion criteria were: (a) random on-off; (b) early morning and painful dystonia; (c) behavioral abnormalities such as major depression, dysthymia or alexithymia based on DSM-V criteria ( ); (d) past and present neurological disorder and/or brain organic conditions (other than PD); (e) pharmacological therapies that could directly impact cognitive functioning, other than dopaminergic pharmacological replacement treatment; (f) any contraindications for participation in a neuroimaging exam (e.g., claustrophobia, implants, metal splinters,\u2026.). \n\nA first voluntary subject was recruited based on these criteria to carry out a first piloting on the feasibility of the fMRI study on PD patients. \n\n\n### Physical Setting \n  \nPatients were admitted in week-in-hospital at the Parkinson\u2019s and Movement Disorders Unit (  Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza di Torino   Hospital) belonging to the Department of Neuroscience. The neurological examination was carried out in the inpatient ward, in the patient\u2019s bed and in rooms properly equipped and able to guarantee privacy. \n\nThe fMRI experimental session was conducted on a 3T Philips Ingenia scanner (Neuroscience Institute of Turin \u2013 Neuroimaging Centre) located at the same hospital. The pre-scan interview and instructions were given in the preparation room; the training was carried out in the scanner room allowing the subject to become familiar with the instrumentation and the experimental setting before starting the experimental acquisition. \n\n\n### Procedures \n  \nAll the procedures were carried out on a week-in-hospital basis, being most of them part of the normal evaluation for the selection of candidates for brain surgery. \n\nNeurological evaluation was performed both in the absence of drug therapy and over the course of the maximum-benefit-peak of the first daily dose ( ;  ,  ). Neuropsychological evaluation was performed on the second day of hospitalization in the on-state and it lasted about an hour and a half. On the third day of hospitalization, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was performed. Importantly, the patient was in therapeutic washout during neuroimaging acquisition, to avoid possible confounding effects of dopamine treatment effects on neuroimaging results ( ,  ). Indeed, the last pharmacological administration was performed 5 h before the fMRI experimental session. \n\nProcedural fidelity was evaluated in each phase. For this purpose, the entire protocol was divided into successive steps, of which the following occurred: presence of dedicated operators, compliance with the daily scheduling, execution, qualitative evaluation of the acquired parameters, patient\u2019s collaboration. \n\n\n### Neurological, Neuropsychiatric and Neuropsychological Assessment \n  \nWith specific reference to the patient selection for the piloting study in fMRI, neurological evaluation was transmitted by a neurologist blind to the aim of the study who had previously used the Movement Disorder Society \u2013 Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) to provide a clinimetric evaluation of patients\u2019 clinical profile ( ). Specifically, motor features and disease severity were assessed using MDS-UPDRS part III and UPDRS total scores, while dyskinesias were assessed using MDS-UPDRS part IV (for both On-/Off- conditions). Hoen and Yahr\u2019s scale (H&Y) was used to outline the disease stage ( ). \n\nThe neuropsychological assessment was performed in line with previous researches ( ;  ,  ,  ) and based on the guidelines of the Task Force commissioned by the Movement Disorder Society to identify Mild Cognitive impairment ( ). These criteria represent an operating scheme that evaluates the cognitive profile on two levels differing in their methods of evaluation and diagnostic certainty ( ). For this case report we applied the first level of evaluation. \n\nNeuropsychiatric assessment included the Hedonistic Homeostatic-Dysregulation scale (HHD), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Apathy Scale (AS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 4.0 (BPRS 4.0) ( ;  ,  ,  ). \n\nThe neuropsychological battery included the Mini-mental State examination (MMSE) and the Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination \u2013 Revised version (ACE-R) to detect the presence of a general cognitive deterioration; attention, perceptual tracking of a sequence and speeded performance were analyzed using the Attentional Matrices (AM) and the Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A); abstract reasoning and fluid intelligence using the Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM-36); executive functions using the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Trail Making Test part B and part B-A, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST); short-term and working memory abilities using Rey-15 word test and Digit Span (backward and forward, respectively). Lastly, information retrieval was evaluated using the Phonemic Fluency Test \u2013 letters F, A, S (FAS) ( ,  ). \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition and Analyses \n  \nAnatomical images were recorded using a T1-weighted sequence (TI = 1650 ms, TR = 4.8 ms, voxel-size = 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm, TE = 331 ms). Functional data were collected using T2 -weighted EPI (TE = 35 ms, TR = 2.20 s slice gap = 0.28 mm, FOV = 24 cm, flip angle = 90\u00b0, slices aligned on the AC-PC line, slice-matrix = 64 \u00d7 64). The patient watched 24 classical ballet videos performed with difficult movements [dance movements (3 s) followed by jittery fixation cross (5\u20137 s)] and 24 videos of daily movements [walking (3 s) followed by jittery fixation cross (5\u20137 s)]. To avoid lack of attention, each participant had to randomly estimate (4 s) the difficulty of the last figure seen on a Likert scale (range 0\u20134). Image preprocessing was performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). Realignment of functional images were spatially applied to the first volume, coregistration of anatomical images were processed to the mean of them. Normalization of the functional images to the MNI space and smoothing (8 mm) were performed. We applied a General Linear Model to convolve subjects\u2019 responses with canonical hemodynamic response. \n\n\n\n## Case Report \n  \nA 59-years-old woman with diagnosis of idiopathic PD was admitted to the hospital for the ascertainment of requirements for subthalamic nucleus (STN)- deep brain stimulation surgery. \n\nThe patient had 5 years education. She had normal developmental milestones and no medical history of note. She had a 12-year PD story, with negative family history. Onset of neurological disorders with tremor in the right hand followed by gradual motor hindrance of the upper limb. For about 4\u20135 years she has been reporting motor fluctuations, with frequent off-phase and dyskinesias. Over the years, levodopa therapy has been set with a gradual increase in the dosage up to 1050 mg/day. \n\nAt the time of this case report, she was retired from work. Married, with children and grandchildren, she maintains autonomy in daily living. At the clinical interview, the patient is alert and collaborative, oriented in time and space. She had no alterations in mood and motivation. \n\nIn addition to the normal evaluation procedures, it was verified that she met the requirements for access to the experimental study. She agreed to undergo the functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm in addition to all the exams scheduled during hospitalization. \n\nMotor features and disease severity were evaluated in on-/off- conditions (MDS-UPDRS on = 61; MDS-UPDRS off = 99; MDS-UPDRS part III on = 10; MDS-UPDRS part III off = 49; MDS-UPDRS part IV on = 4; MDS-UPDRS part IV off = 4; H&Y on = 0; H&Y off = 2). The neuropsychological assessment was performed in the best-on phase, immediately after the neurological examination and the approval by the treating neurologist. \n\nThe patient exhibited a normal global cognitive profile, reaching normative scores on all the neuropsychological batteries, however, slight abnormalities were detected for the performance on short-term memory for unstructured verbal material ( ). The neuropsychiatric assessment revealed no behavioral changes. \n  \nNeuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment in the on-phase of the disease. \n    \nDuring the observation of dance movements contrasted to daily movements, bold signal activation was higher in the left thalamus (lTH:   x   = \u22123   y   = \u221222   z   = 9,   p   = 0.002 FWE-corrected), right superior precentral gyrus (rSPCg:   x   = 40   y   = \u221235   z   = 47,   p   = 0.002 FWE-corrected), left superior precentral gyrus (lSPCg:   x   = \u221237   y   = \u221238   z   = 51,   p   = 0.000 FWE-corrected), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC:   x   = 47   y   = 32   z   = 30,   p   < 0.001 FWE-corrected) ( ). \n  \nFMRI results. Differences in the neural activation between dance movements vs. daily movements. Statistical maps are displayed on a standard T1 template. lTH, left thalamus; rSPCg, right superior precentral gyrus; lSPCg, left superior precentral gyrus; rdlPFC, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \n  \nIn the post-acquisition interview, the subject reported that the experience in fMRI, however, complex at the beginning, was gradually more acceptable. Seeing videos helped her not to think about the discomfort felt in the scanner. The proposed activity was not excessively difficult and left her with a pleasant feeling of well-being. She would have liked to move with such gracefulness and harmony. She felt like dancing and asked if there are dance classes for people like her. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n Emotion   is \u2013 as the word itself says \u2013   movement  . Not only a metaphorical   motus   of the soul. Emotion is a reaction that underlies neurochemical changes and bodily manifestations with biological and communicative purposes. The choreutical arts fit exactly into the experience of the mind-body union (embodiment), accompanying people to fully experience their own emotional contents, express and transform them through dance. Dance therapy applied to PD has the peculiarity of proposing both a motor and emotional stimulation, in a pathology whose most significant symptoms are precisely motor impairment accompanied by behavioral abnormalities. \n\nTo experience the emotion linked to the gesture, it is not necessary to carry out the movement. The identical sets of brain areas can be activated in an individual who is simply witnessing another person performing a movement as if he/she was actually involved in the motor behavior as the one actually engaged in it ( ). The basal ganglia \u2013 whose dysfunction results in a wide range of neurological conditions including PD \u2013 may be involved in action observation, since the STN shows similar activity changes in both movement execution and observation ( ;  ). Importantly, given the association between MNS and empathy, Theory of Mind impairment seems to be at least partially mediated by MNS dysfunction in PD ( ). This case report has been conducted to consider the appropriateness of the   fMRI paradigm applied to PD and provide information about the MNS in motor disorders. We aimed at answering the questions: What happens when a PD patient goes from observing a mere facial expression to evaluating the observation of complex behaviors like the choreutical arts? Does a phenomenon of \u201cimmediate neuronal resonance\u201d persist for complex movements in PD? Could this mechanism be exploited for the rehabilitation of motor disorders? \n\nWe managed to make a complete acquisition of the chosen fMRI paradigm, supporting our hypothesis that it is possible to propose this experimentation to a sample of PD patients. Data collected in this circumstance suggest that brain areas connected with the MNS are activated, but the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the thalamus are also elicited. \n\nMotor-related cortex, such as the precentral gyrus, has been previously identified as key neural underpinning involved in the \u201cmirroring\u201d of emotional expressions ( ). Indeed, the activity in the precentral gyrus has been proposed as regions that facilitate internal simulation as a mechanism for affective empathy ( ).   found that the superior portion of the precentral gyrus showed higher recruitment during tasks of social change perception that can only be overcome with an understanding of body gestures and facial expressions. Moreover, the SCP was found to be related to action observation and acquired motor skills in a study by  : it therefore seems possible that this neural area may be involved in the generation of internal motor representation of observed action (and emotions). \n\nThe thalamus \u2013 which provides input to the premotor cortex \u2013 has been previously found to be elicited by action observation in a fMRI study aimed at examining longitudinal changes in neuronal activity in a group of patients with subacute stroke ( ). A tendency of increase in activation over time was observed in the left thalamus ( ). The thalamus has not typically been ascribed mirror properties, but it is an important relay station. Moreover, a major input to premotor areas is associated with voluntary movements ( ).   suggested that the strong thalamic response may be interpreted as a potential compensatory mechanism, emphasizing the importance of somatosensory feedback for functional recovery. Considering the above, the thalamus recruitment in our PD patient could therefore be attributed to the prevalence of emotional, motivational and reward aspects activated by complex action observation. Indeed, the thalamus has been previously found to be related with both mentalizing and emotion ( ,  ;  ), especially when predicting their own or others\u2019 future emotional response ( ). The thalamus can have a role also when successful performance requires the update of action-outcome associations ( ). \n\nThe dlPFC has connections with the thalamus and parts of the basal ganglia ( ). This brain area has direct influence on social behavior ( ), since it performs cognitive control in complex social situations ( ). Specifically, dlPFC is involved in maintaining the internal representation of intentions and the norms for achieving them ( ), in generating and maintaining causal links between actions and their outcomes so that previous experiences can guide the selection of future behaviors ( ,  ;  ). It is therefore not surprising that dlPFC is recruited by complex action observation. \n\nWe claim that complex action observation may constitute a possible access to the motor system in PD. Not only basal ganglia might be engaged by MNS activity ( ), but action observation involves both cortical and subcortical processes ( ;  ). Before us,   suggested action observation as a possible gateway to retraining motor function during rehabilitation. The modulation of the neural area involved in this process could be considered a promising target for neuro-rehabilitative intervention mediated by the elicitation of the MNS. The implementation of training programs based on the observation of executed actions could allow the activation of motor representations and the reinforcement of old and/or new motor patterns learning, while modulating motivational processes in PD.   have recently suggested that action observation is a \u201csafe and feasible\u201d rehabilitative exercise for improving balance, gait, and reducing falls in PD. Their positive findings, the simplicity of treatment, the lack of side effects, support our hypothesis of exploiting MNS, action observation and \u201csomato-aesthetic empathy\u201d to act on a motivational and behavioral level. To date, yet almost nothing has been attempted against dyskinesias, which instead require prolonged monitoring and complex medical management. \n\nDyskinesia can have harmful effects on the quality of life of both patients and caregivers and create extra pressure on the health system ( ;  ). While different approaches are adopted by movement disorders specialists to delay or manage levodopa-induced dyskinesias, general practitioners and neurologists without specific skills may have difficulty controlling involuntary movements, while maintaining a significant clinical improvement in the typical PD symptomatology ( ). Innovative interventions are needed to meet the unmet needs of PD patients and therapies for PD go far beyond pharmacological treatment, deep brain stimulation or stem cells ( ). The most recent therapeutic approaches have highlighted the importance of the multidisciplinary perspective and the usefulness of physiotherapy and the so-called \u201ccomplementary therapies\u201d ( ), among which complex action observation could give interesting results ( ). \n\nAs rightly pointed out by  , clinicians must consider the patient\u2019s own perspective on the impact of levodopa-induced dyskinesias on his/her motor repertoire. Where the impact is considered not relevant, dyskinesias are not considered problematic. However, these considerations must be interpreted cautiously, considering literature showing that dyskinetic patients may suffer from Dyskinesias-Reduced-Self-Awareness ( ,  ,  ,  ;  ). Consequently, even if patients do not complain about their levodopa-induced dyskinesias, dyskinesia can still have a deleterious effect on their own motor repertoire. As such, slight dyskinesia may not be problematic, but more severe forms may reduce quality of life by affecting the patient\u2019s motor repertoire ( ). Since clinicians should broaden the motor repertoire available to patients when assessing the efficacy of their treatment strategy against levodopa-induced dyskinesias, strengthening this repertoire is essential. The principle behind the reasoning is that if the observed action becomes part of the observer\u2019s motor repertoire thanks to affective empathy, mirror neurons activate and the understanding of movement becomes a bodily experience ( ). Indeed, complex action observation \u2013 like that involved in the observation of choreutical movements \u2013 can elicit modulatory brain processes at any level, going from peripheral districts of the body to the motor brain areas and higher-level circuits or, conversely, going from central movement preparatory areas to motor areas and the periphery of the body ( ;  ). \n\nConsequently, complex action observation might improve or slow the deterioration of motor abilities in PD patients since it is able to evoke a huger neural activation of the cortical-subcortical network that supervises motor control, partially compensating the damages of motor execution areas ( ). \n\nThe most critical limitation to our inferences is that we only have data from a single case now. Therefore, the ability to draw generalizable assumptions is severely hindered and our conclusions must be accepted with caution. However, this study is exploratory in nature and aimed at providing first indications on the topic. Complex action observation effects over dyskinesia, motor impairment and behavioral abnormalities need to be further investigated. Future research should include a greater sample size and thoroughly evaluate MNS embodiment neural mechanisms over time using long-term follow-up. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee \u201cA.O.U.

Dopaminergic medications ameliorate Parkinsonian motor symptoms, but less is known regarding the impact of dopaminergic agents on affective processing, particularly in depressed PD (dPD) patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dopaminergic pharmacotherapy on brain activation to emotional stimuli in depressed versus nondepressed Parkinson disease (ndPD) patients. Participants included 18 ndPD patients (11 men, 7 women) and 10 dPD patients (7 men, 3 women). Patients viewed photographs of emotional faces during functional MRI. Scans were performed while the patient was taking anti-Parkinson medication and the day after medication had been temporarily discontinued. Results indicate that dopaminergic medications have opposite effects in the prefrontal cortex depending upon depression status. DPD patients show greater deactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) on dopaminergic medications than off, while ndPD patients show greater deactivation in this region off drugs. The VMPFC is in the default-mode network (DMN). DMN activity is negatively correlated with activity in brain systems used for external visual attention. Thus dopaminergic medications may promote increased attention to external visual stimuli among dPD patients but impede normal suppression of DMN activity during external stimulation among ndPD patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by tremor, muscular rigidity, and bradykinesia. Individuals with PD also experience nonmotor symptoms, such as impairments in cognitive and emotional processing, including depression, anxiety, and apathy (see Blonder and Slevin [ ] for a review). Although dopaminergic drugs show considerable efficacy in treating PD motor symptoms, dopaminergic pharmacotherapy may have variable effects on cognitive and affective processing depending upon the mood state of the PD patient. In particular, Blonder et al. [ ] found that depressed PD (dPD) patients performed more poorly on neuropsychological tests of working memory and facial affect recognition while on dopaminergic medications than while off. Nondepressed PD (ndPD) patients showed the opposite pattern. \n\nFunctional neuroimaging studies of dPD patients have shown abnormalities in the caudate, orbitofrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, limbic system, and thalamus [ \u2013 ]. Few studies have examined regional brain response to dopaminergic drugs during cognitive or affective processing in dPD, although functional imaging studies suggest that dopaminergic drugs modulate cognitive function among PD patients generally. (Please note that the wording \u201cactivity\u201d is used broadly in referring to an implied underlying neural activity. Absolute levels of brain activity such as those quantified by cerebral blood flow and/or metabolism cannot be measured in fMRI experiments using BOLD contrast; only changes in activity can be detected. Positive changes in the activity level induced by a task relative to baseline are called \u201cactivation.\u201d Negative changes in the activity level induced by a task relative to baseline are called \u201cdeactivation.\u201d The wording \u201cfMRI response\u201d refers to observations of either activation or deactivation.) For example, Mattay et al. [ ] found that activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex during a working memory task was more focused while PD patients were on dopaminergic medications and more diffuse while they were off medication. While there were no statistically significant differences in cognitive test performance as a function of medication status, motor performance positively correlated with activation in cortical motor regions during the dopamine-replete state. Participant mood was not reported. Argyelan et al. [ ], using a motor sequence learning task, showed that normal deactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) was suppressed in ndPD patients when they were on dopaminergic medication. Also, treatment-mediated changes in the deactivation response correlated with baseline task performance. Cools et al. [ ] used PET to study PD patients on and off levodopa and found no significant differences in performance during planning and spatial working memory tasks as a function of medication status. L-Dopa decreased cerebral blood flow in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during both the spatial working memory and planning tasks relative to the visuomotor control task. During the working memory task, the levodopa-induced decrease was accompanied by a significant relative increase in right occipital lobe blood flow. The authors excluded patients with a history of depression unrelated to PD, but participant mood in association with PD is not reported. Tessitore et al. [ ] used fMRI to study dopaminergic modulation of affective processing in PD. They found a lack of amygdala activation in response to angry and fearful facial expressions in patients deprived of dopaminergic medications. In contrast, normal volunteers showed robust responses. Amygdala activation in PD was partially restored when dopaminergic pharmacotherapy was reinstituted. In spite of the increase in amygdala activation during the dopamine-replete state, performance on the emotional face recognition task did not differ as a function of medication status. Five of nine patients in that study had a history of depression, but the investigators did not find an association between depression and amygdala response. This may have been due to low statistical power related to small sample size. \n\nThe goal of the current study was to examine the effects of dopaminergic medication on regional brain fMRI responses to affective stimuli in depressed versus nondepressed PD patients. As described above, Blonder et al. [ ] found that dPD patients showed increased depression severity based on Geriatric Depression Scale [ ] scores and performed more poorly on verbal memory and facial affect recognition while on dopaminergic drugs than while off. Dopaminergic medications had the opposite effect on memory and affect recognition in ndPD patients in that performance improved on dopaminergic drugs. Past neuropsychological studies have shown impairments in affect recognition among PD patients, but these studies did not focus on comorbid depression and the results are inconsistent [ \u2013 ]. Research on depressed psychiatric patients has reported impairments in facial affect processing, suggesting that PD patients with depression may also be at increased risk for these deficits [ \u2013 ]. In healthy adults, the brain regions most typically activated on fMRI during facial affect processing include the prefrontal cortex and limbic areas implicated in dPD, providing a rationale for these tasks as salient in dPD [ ]. \n\n\n## 2. Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThe participants in this study were the same as those reported in Blonder et al. [ ] and consisted of 28 right-handed, nondemented, idiopathic PD patients (10 women, 18 men). Patients were diagnosed by an American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology-certified neurologist specializing in movement disorders (JTS) using UK Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria [ ]. Patients with a diagnosis of mild to moderate idiopathic PD (\u22643 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale) were eligible to participate. Patients were under treatment with levodopa plus carbidopa either alone or in combination with dopamine agonists. Of the 28 participants, 18 were not depressed (11 men, 7 women) and 10 met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder (7 men, 3 women). Of these, seven had major depressive disorder; three had minor depression. Three of the ten dPD patients were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at the time of testing, one patient was also receiving a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and six were not receiving antidepressant medication. DPD patients who were taking antidepressant medication did not discontinue these medications during the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are given in  . All participants gave written informed consent under a protocol approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. The participants in this study reflected PD patients more generally in that the dPD patients both in this sample and in the population represent slightly more than one-third of idiopathic PD patients [ ] and tend to be younger [ ,  ]. \n\nParticipants attended a screening visit at the University of Kentucky Medical Center followed by two additional visits during which they received neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessments. During one of the two visits patients took their Parkinson medication as prescribed and during the other visit they ceased to take anti-Parkinson medication prior to midnight the night before testing. Patients on dopaminergic medications had their most recent dose approximately one to two hours prior to testing. The order of drug-on versus drug-off sessions was counterbalanced across subjects. \n\n\n### 2.2. Emotional Face Processing \n  \nThe functional neuroanatomy of emotional face processing has been well studied. The brain regions most strongly implicated are the fusiform gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, the middle temporal gyrus, the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the amygdala. These are areas that have shown significant activation to neutral and emotionally expressive faces among healthy volunteers [ ,  \u2013 ]. In studies of individuals with PD, Sprengelmeyer et al. [ ] found that never-medicated patients were impaired in the recognition of anger and disgust compared to medicated patients. Lawrence et al. [ ] found that PD patients withdrawn from dopaminergic therapy experienced difficulty recognizing anger on the face. As described above, Tessitore et al. [ ] showed a lack of amygdala activation to angry and fearful facial expressions in PD patients off dopaminergic medications. None of these studies focused on Parkinsonian depression nor did they compare depressed and nondepressed PD patients. \n\n\n### 2.3. fMRI Stimuli \n  \nStimuli consisted of grayscale still photographs of human faces from standardized sets published by Ekman and Friesen [ ], Gur et al. [ ,  ], and Matsumoto and Ekman [ ]. Faces displayed happy, sad, angry, or neutral expressions. The choice of these expressions was based on design considerations and recent literature associating deficits in the recognition of angry faces with PD [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.4. Presentation \n  \nStimuli were displayed in sequence onto a translucent screen placed at the rear of the MR scanner using E-Prime software and an MRI compatible projection system. Participants viewed this screen from within the bore of the magnet by means of a mirror placed on the head coil. At the beginning of a run, pictures from each category were shown. Data acquired during this \u201csham\u201d epoch were not used for analysis. Pictures were subsequently grouped three at a time into blocks according to stimulus category. Each picture was shown for 3.7\u2009sec followed by a blank screen lasting 0.5\u2009sec with picture epochs lasting for 12.6\u2009sec. Picture epochs were separated by variable-duration periods of rest during which a fixation point was shown. Fixation periods lasted for 8.4\u201312.6\u2009sec with a mean duration of 10.5\u2009sec. Stimulus categories appeared in random order, and the order of presentation was counterbalanced within runs as well as across runs and sessions. Participants were told when viewing a face to concentrate on what the person is feeling and when viewing a plus sign to simply concentrate on the image and try not to think of anything else. \n\n\n### 2.5. Image Acquisition and Analysis \n  \nfMRI data were collected on a Siemens Magnetom TRIO 3 Tesla imaging system using the body coil to transmit and an optional 8-channel head array coil to receive. A T -weighted gradient echo EPI sequence was used with acquisition parameters: TR/TE = 2100/28\u2009msec, FA = 77\u00b0, matrix = 64 \u00d7 64, and FOV = 224 \u00d7 224\u2009mm. Each EPI volume consisted of 38 slices 3.5\u2009mm thick, yielding isotropic voxels. Two runs were performed, each containing 185 volumes and lasting about 6.5 minutes. In the same position as the EPI images we acquired a field map using a double-echo, gradient echo technique. A 3D MPRAGE sequence (TR/TE/TI = 2100/2.93/1100\u2009msec, FA = 12\u00b0, FOV = 224 \u00d7 256 \u00d7 192\u2009mm, 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1\u2009mm isotropic voxels, sagittal partitions) was used to collect anatomical images for the localization of functional responses and for the registration of subjects' fMRI data sets across sessions and to stereotactic standard Talairach space [ ]. \n\nImage data analysis was performed off-line using Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) software and the Oxford Center for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL). The EPI volumes comprising the fMRI data were corrected for motion and slice timing within runs and registered across runs and across sessions. Geometric distortion correction of the slice images was done in native space based on the acquired field map. Voxelwise analysis of the intensity-normalized, spatially smoothed (3D Gaussian kernel), and concatenated time series response was subsequently carried out by multiple linear regression, providing simultaneous parameter estimates for each stimulus category versus a baseline of fixation comprising 80 EPI volumes. The estimated motion parameters along with drift terms were included as nuisance regressors in the baseline model. The box-car shape of the reference functions for each of the stimulus categories was convolved with Cohen's canonical hemodynamic impulse response function to better reflect the temporal delay and dynamic nature of the fMRI response. Activation contrasts of interest measured as fractional signal change were computed and transformed to standard Talairach coordinate space for second-level group analyses. Resampling by cubic spline interpolation in standard space was used, yielding isotropic 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\u2009mm voxels. Based upon the spatial resolution of the raw fMRI data and the amount of spatial smoothing applied during preprocessing, the activation/deactivation response measured at each voxel location reflects the average across a resolution element of size 10\u2009mm on edge. For second-level group analysis, an exploratory voxelwise random effects analysis of variance was initially carried out with depression as the between subjects factor (present or absent) and dopaminergic medication status (on or off) as the within subjects factor. The dependent response measure was the activation/deactivation contrast between emotional face stimuli (averaged across all three emotion categories of happy, angry, and sad) and a fixation baseline. Note that neutral facial expressions were not used in this analysis, as comparisons with fixation for mapping of deactivations within the default-mode network represent a more appropriate baseline in simulating resting state. The voxelwise analysis was followed by a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis using   a priori   anatomically defined ROIs and incorporating response measures for each of the separate emotions as well as controlling for potential confounds of age and education. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nPronounced differences in levels of deactivation of the midline default-mode network as a function of depression and dopaminergic medication status are readily apparent (see  ). \n\nThe voxelwise analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant medication by depression interaction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) with a peak effect at Talairach location [(  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) = (3,53,16)]. DPD patients show greater deactivation on versus off dopaminergic medications while ndPD patients show the opposite pattern (see  ). A companion   FreeSurfer   analysis of the structural MRI scans did not show any significant differences in medial prefrontal cortex brain region volume between the groups of nondepressed and depressed PD patients adjusted for age and education. The VMPFC location of the peak interaction effect corresponds to the anterior cingulate cortex region as defined by the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas of Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. [ ]. A full factorial analysis was subsequently carried out in SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) using region-of-interest fMRI response data for the separate emotions extracted from this anatomical ROI, referred to in the following as VMPFC. The mean fractional signal change across all voxels within the ROI was used as the dependent measure. \n\nAn ANOVA for a crossover design was used with depression as the between subjects factor (present or absent) and dopaminergic medication status (on or off), emotion category (angry, happy, or sad), and hemisphere (left or right) as within subjects factors. Age and education served as covariates in the analysis, although neither variable was found to be correlated with the fMRI activation/deactivation response and therefore would not affect the result. This analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction between depression, dopaminergic medication status, and emotion category (  F  (2,48) = 4.76;   P   = 0.013). The three-way interaction may be driven by a significant interaction between depression and dopaminergic medication status for happy faces (  F  (1,24) = 6.72;   P   = 0.016). There was no effect of hemisphere.   lists the least squares marginal means averaged across hemispheres for this VMPFC region; the averages across emotion categories for the depression by medication design are displayed in  . \n\nThe separate activation/deactivation maps for patient groups and medication status clearly depict the presence of this interaction as reflecting varying levels of deactivation within the default-mode network, a network of brain regions active when the brain is at rest (see  ). In particular,   shows that depressed and nondepressed PD patients exhibit opposite effects such that dPD patients have greater deactivation in the VMPFC while on dopaminergic drugs whereas ndPD patients show greater deactivation off dopaminergic drugs. The effect of depression itself, manifested as a reduced level of VMPFC deactivation, is clearly visible in the left-hand activation/deactivation maps for facial emotion processing tasks acquired off dopaminergic medication. \n\nAn additional interaction effect is present in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) of the voxelwise analysis bilaterally [(  x  ,   y  ,   z  ) = (\u00b131,27, \u22126)]. The effect is somewhat more pronounced and spatially extensive in the right hemisphere, although the left-right difference was not statistically significant. This location is part of the task-positive brain network activated by emotional faces and corresponds to the inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis region of the AAL atlas [ ]. A separate ANOVA was subsequently carried out using region-of-interest fMRI response data extracted from this anatomical ROI, referred to in the following as VLPFC. The mean fractional signal change across all voxels within the ROI was again used as the dependent measure. This analysis revealed a significant depression-by-medication interaction (  F  (1,24) = 7.20;   P   = 0.013) along with a medication-by-emotion interaction (  F  (2,48) = 3.44;   P   = 0.040). Additionally, there is a significant main effect of emotion category in the VLPFC (  F  (2,48) = 4.51;   P   = 0.016) with less activation to happy faces than to angry and to sad faces.   shows that depressed and nondepressed PD patients exhibit opposite effects such that dPD patients have greater activation in the VLPFC while off dopaminergic drugs whereas the nondepressed PD patients show greater activation on dopaminergic drugs. The depression-by-medication interaction may be reflective of a reciprocal modulation in the prefrontal cortex between the VMPFC and VLPFC [ \u2013 ]. In both nondepressed and dPD patients, increased activation in VLPFC is associated with decreased deactivation in VMPFC. \n\n depicts the bivariate nature of the (VMPFC, VLPFC) activity measures averaged across individual emotions and hemispheres for all ndPD and dPD subjects as well as off and on their dopaminergic medication. A general association between increased activation in VLPFC and decreased deactivation in VMPFC is apparent. \n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn sum, we found that dopaminergic medications used to treat PD have opposite effects in two regions of the prefrontal cortex depending upon whether or not the patient suffers from depression. In particular, dPD patients show greater deactivation in the VMPFC on dopaminergic medications than they do off. In contrast, ndPD patients show greater deactivation in this region off these drugs. In the VLPFC, dPD patients show less activation on dopaminergic medications versus off, while ndPD patients show the opposite pattern. \n\nThe VMPFC is considered a region in the default-mode network (DMN), that is, a network of brain regions that remains active during rest periods [ ]. Resting activity in the DMN is reduced when individuals shift attentional resources from self-referential to task-related processes. DMN activity is negatively correlated with brain systems used for focused external visual attention. Our results suggest that the administration of dopaminergic medications to dPD patients facilitates this shift in attention from self-referential to external foci whereas the administration of dopaminergic medications to nondepressed PD patients impedes this attentional shift. \n\nNeuropsychiatric research has shown that major depressive disorder and dysthymia are associated with alterations in the structure and function of the DMN [ \u2013 ]. In PET studies of idiopathic depressed patients, the VMPFC has been shown to be hyperactive at rest [ ,  ]. Similarly, an event-related fMRI design revealed an elevated tonic level of VMPFC activity [ ] and abnormally increased resting-state functional connectivity in depression [ ]. Hyperactivity of the VMPFC in depression is typically accompanied by reduced metabolism and blood flow within dorsal and lateral prefrontal regions such as the VLPFC [ ,  ,  ]. Normal resting blood flow and metabolism in these PFC regions is restored upon treatment with antidepressants medications [ \u2013 ]. \n\nFMRI studies have found that depressed individuals show less deactivation of the VMPFC compared to normal controls during externally oriented tasks [ ,  ]. For example, Sheline et al. [ ] found that unmedicated patients with major depression failed to decrease activity in the DMN, including the VMPFC, when viewing and reappraising negative pictures. Johnson et al. [ ] noted that the lack of deactivation in the VMPFC during distraction was positively associated with levels of negative rumination in a group of largely unmedicated depressed patients. In the present study, we see a reduced level of VMPFC deactivation in depressed compared to nondepressed PD patients off their dopaminergic medications. (Region-of-interest data for a separate group of 17 age-matched normal control subjects showed a VMPFC deactivation level of \u22120.105. Those subjects were scanned on two separate days without dopaminergic drugs using the same protocol but are not part of the analysis for the present study. This normal level of deactivation is greater than for either subgroup of PD patients.) \n\nIn an investigation of antidepressant effect on functional connectivity in the DMN among dysthymic patients, Posner et al. [ ] found that treatment with the selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine normalized DMN connectivity. Posner et al. [ ] noted that while DMN functional connectivity improved among dysthymic patients on SNRIs, mood did not. They attributed this apparent discrepancy to the fact that activity in the DMN is associated with rumination and the depression scale that they used did not measure that particular symptom [ ,  ]. In the present study, we find greater deactivation in VMPFC and less activation in VLPFC of dPD patients when performing an emotional face recognition task on dopaminergic medications versus off, suggesting that dopaminergic drugs may act similarly to SNRIs in normalizing DMN activity patterns. Like the findings of Posner et al., medication-related changes in activity patterns did not translate into improved mood or affect recognition as these functions declined in dPD patients on dopaminergic drugs [ ]; we also did not measure rumination. Hypothetically, rumination may have decreased in dPD patients on dopaminergic drugs in concert with an increase in VMPFC deactivation and presumed increased attention to affective faces. We should point out that a post hoc analysis of the subgroups of dPD patients on and off dopaminergic medication shows that the differential activation patterns seen at the group level are not due to a large confounding effect of SSRI/SNRI in half of the dPD patient group. Rather the contributions from the SSRI/SNRI medicated patients have a diluting effect on the interactions observed in the VMPFC as well as in the VLPFC. \n\nOur findings may reflect reciprocal modulation in the prefrontal cortex between the VMPFC and VLPFC. This is consistent with prior work by Northoff et al. [ ] and Harvey et al. [ ]. For example, Northoff et al. [ ] found that both emotional and nonemotional judgments of emotionally evocative pictures elicited increased activation in VLPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and concurrent signal decreases in the VMPFC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Subsequently, Northoff et al. [ ] commented on the see-saw balance between medial and lateral forebrain regions. They proposed a resting-state hypothesis of major depressive disorder in which abnormal resting-state activity leads to reduced rest-stimulus interaction manifested as reduced task-related deactivation responses in those regions with high resting-state midcortical activity [ ,  ]. In an fMRI study of working memory in patients with major depression, Harvey et al. [ ] saw increased activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. Performance and reaction times were comparable. These findings suggest that depressed patients must recruit more neural resources in order to maintain working memory performance comparable to normal controls. Furthermore, Harvey et al. [ ] interpreted this as an attempt by depressed subjects to counter the lack of deactivation in the limbic PFC by enhancing the activity of the lateral PFC in order to maintain the same \u201cactivity gap\u201d between the two regions compared to healthy controls. In a review of the literature on emotion regulation, Phillips et al. [ ] proposed a neural model in which VMPFC activity (among that of other medial prefrontal regions) is associated with automatic emotion regulation and VLPFC activity is associated with voluntary emotion regulation. Sheline et al. [ ] noted the failure to decrease activity in the DMN in depression and suggested that dysregulation of automatic emotion processing indicates the fundamental importance of the DMN in depression. Depressed individuals achieve successful emotion regulation by recruiting additional lateral prefrontal neural regions including VLPFC to overcome the dysfunction of VMPFC [ ,  ,  ]. This model is consistent with our data. In fact, it would appear that the relationship depicted for depressed and nondepressed groups of PD patients in Figures   and   holds true across a continuum; thus, our data show a linear relationship between VMPFC deactivation and VLPFC activation. The scatter plot in   reveals that the slope of this relationship is similar for depressed and nondepressed PD patients and is similar to that for a separate group of age-matched normal controls scanned under the same protocol (but not part of this study). \n\nWe know of no prior studies that have examined the effects of dopaminergic medications on neural activity during cognitive or affective processing among dPD patients specifically. However, as noted in Introduction, a few studies have looked at cerebral activation in nondepressed PD patients or in heterogeneous samples of PD patients on and/or off dopaminergic medications [ ,  ,  ], and some investigators have focused on the DMN. For example, van Eimeren et al. [ ] used fMRI to examine executive function/short-term memory in the DMN of PD patients off dopaminergic medications. They found deactivation of the medial PFC in both healthy controls and PD patients. However, PD patients showed significantly less task-associated deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus. In addition, the medial prefrontal cortex and the rostral ventromedial caudate nucleus were functionally disconnected in PD. The authors did not exclude patients with dysthymia or minor depression as indicated by Beck Depression Inventory cut-off scores; thus the sample was likely heterogeneous making the results difficult to interpret. Using PET, Argyelan et al. [ ] observed comparable deactivation of the VMPFC during a sequence learning task in unmedicated ndPD patients and healthy control participants. When medicated, the ndPD patients failed to demonstrate learning-related deactivation based on PET. Our finding that ndPD patients show less deactivation of the VMPFC on dopaminergic medication compared to off is consistent with these results. \n\nDelaveau et al. [ ] examined PD patients' responses to emotional facial expressions on and off levodopa and found increased deactivation in the posterior cingulate/precuneus region of the DMN on medication, suggesting that levodopa increased patients' ability to attend to external stimuli. They did not see any differences in VMPFC deactivation in PD patients on and off levodopa however. While Delaveau et al. [ ] excluded PD patients with major depression, they did not exclude patients with mild depression or dysthymia, providing a possible explanation for the discrepant findings. \n\nPast research suggests that dopaminergic medication improves or impairs cognitive performance depending on the nature of the task and on individual variation in the basal level of dopamine in the underlying corticostriatal circuitry [ ,  ]. Studies indicate that baseline levels of dopamine influence performance such that low levels accompany poor performance, which is generally improved by dopamine analogues or receptor agonists. By contrast, high levels of baseline dopamine accompany good performance which is generally impaired by DA receptor analogues and agonists due to a \u201clevodopa overdose\u201d effect [ ,  ]. In our prior work, ndPD patients did more poorly on cognitive tests off dopaminergic medication, whereas dPD patients performed better off drugs [ ]. On dopaminergic medication, the pattern of test scores was reversed with a resulting poorer performance among dPD subjects [ ]. In the present fMRI study, activation of the VLPFC, a region known to be involved also in cognitive control, exhibits a similar interaction pattern in its modulation by depression and medication status. \n\nEvidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene influence these responses. COMT is an enzyme that regulates dopamine and other catecholamines in various brain regions. The   met  -allele of COMT is associated with higher baseline levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex as well as enhanced working memory, executive function, attention, and reactivity to negative emotional stimuli on fMRI [ ,  ]. The   met  -allele is also associated with a higher risk of depression [ ,  ] and may indicate an increased risk of PD as well as variability in individual response to levodopa therapy [ \u2013 ]. Individuals who are homozygous for the   met  -allele (high tonic, low phasic dopamine) have been shown to perform significantly better on certain cognitive tasks than individuals possessing the   val  -allele [ ]. \n\nUsing fMRI with an emotion processing paradigm, Smolka et al. [ ] found that the   met  -allele was associated with increased activation in VLPFC during passive viewing of unpleasant stimuli. Upon oral administration of amphetamine, which is thought to block the reuptake of dopamine, Mattay et al. [ ] observed improvement in performance on an n-back working memory task among subjects with the   val   genotype while performance deteriorated in   met   subjects who have inherently high basal PFC dopamine levels. The changes seen in cognitive testing following amphetamine were accompanied by a similar switch in DLPFC activation when the n-back task was performed during fMRI data acquisition. These observations provide evidence of an inverted-U functional-response curve to increasing dopamine signaling in the PFC. Interindividual variation in the effects of dopaminergic drugs may reflect genetic variations in baseline levels of dopamine and in the individual's positioning on this inverted-U shaped curve. Individuals may therefore exhibit differential sensitivity to the positive and negative effects of dopaminergic drugs [ ]. Argyelan et al. [ ] in turn looked at the DMN in PD and found a reduction in VMPFC deactivation during a sequence learning task upon administration of levodopa. We see a similar reduction in the level of VMPFC deactivation in ndPD patients when performing an emotional face recognition task on dopaminergic medication compared to off. Depressed PD patients, on the other hand, increase their level of VMPFC deactivation while on dopamine analogues and agonists. When Argyelan et al. [ ] performed COMT genotyping of their sample of PD patients, they noticed that the inverted-U dependence on dopamine level might explain the changes seen in VMPFC deactivation. In particular, they observed an interaction between COMT genotype and levodopa administration status in which levodopa reduced the magnitude of deactivation in   val   carriers but enhanced the deactivation response in   met   homozygotes. Given that dopaminergic input to the VMPFC from ventral striatum is relatively preserved in PD, Argyelan et al. [ ] speculated that this region may be more susceptible to local overdose effects [ ]. \n\nIn the present study, dPD patients off dopaminergic drugs exhibited a failure to suppress the default-mode activity manifested as a reduced level of deactivation in VMPFC during external stimulation with photographs of emotional faces. Suppression of the default-mode activity during task performance was restored by dopaminergic medication. The inverse effect involving activation of the VLPFC supports the view of reciprocal limbic-cortical function and negative mood state [ ]. We posit that brain activity in the prefrontal cortex may follow an inverted-U shape with the effects of dopaminergic medication dependent upon individual variation in COMT polymorphisms that influence baseline dopamine levels (see  ). If true, and in keeping with the findings of Argyelan et al. [ ], we would expect an association between the   met  -allele genotype and Parkinson's depression to explain increased suppression of the VMPFC and reduced activation of the VLPFC following administration of dopaminergic medications. Future research will assess this hypothesis. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4697088, "text_md5": "c4b51edda1931cafa955de7e5b6a778a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 156], "journal": [157, 171], "publication_year": [173, 177], "title": [188, 276], "keywords": [290, 290], "abstract": [303, 1747], "body": [1756, 35865]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26793404, "doi": "10.1155/2015/513452", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697088", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4697088"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697088\">4697088</a>", "list_title": "PMC4697088  Dopaminergic Modulation of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Deactivation in Parkinson Depression"}
{"text": "Tajima, Yasutaka and Sone, Yukako and Yaguchi, Hiroaki and Mito, Yasunori\nCase Rep Neurol, 2021\n\n# Title\n\nVery-Late-Onset Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder in a Patient with Breast Cancer and Parkinson Disease\n\n# Keywords\n\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\nAnti-aquaporin-4 antibody\nBreast cancer\nParkinson disease\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAnti-aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP-4) antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune disorder resulting in severe, recurrent optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, brain stem syndrome, and other types of neurological involvement. Its median age of onset has been reported to be around 40 years. We report herein a case of very-late-onset NMOSD (76 years of age) and try to promote its awareness as a type of neurological deterioration in elder patients. A 76-year-old woman suffering from Parkinson disease was admitted to our hospital because of consciousness disturbance. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery high-signal-intensity lesions in the right peri- and intralateral ventricle. Part of this lesion and the meninges showed gadolinium enhancement. Physical examination revealed the presence of a tumor in the right breast, which was later diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma. In addition, laboratory examinations led to the detection of anti-AQP-4 antibodies in her serum; consequently, the patient was diagnosed as having NMOSD. She received initial pulsed steroid therapy, followed by right mastectomy. Although the patient's consciousness improved significantly, she developed abrupt-onset bilateral leg weakness and multiple longitudinal spinal cord lesions. Additional steroid therapy ameliorated the patient's leg weakness and reduced the swelling of the spinal cord. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by the preferential involvement of the optic nerves and spinal cord with positivity for anti-aquaporin-4 (anti-AQP-4) antibodies [ ,  ]. This disease often presents in the fourth decade of life and exhibits female predominance. In rare instances, NMOSD has been reported in elderly persons (over 50 years of age), and the clinical entity of late-onset NMOSD has been mentioned [ ]. Compared with early-onset NNOSD (below 50 years of age), late-onset NMOSD may exhibit characteristic features, especially those associated with aging or other non-neurological issues [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Here, we report a case of very-late-onset NMOSD in an elderly patient (76 years of age) with breast cancer and Parkinson disease who exhibited an unusual disease course. \n\n\n## Case Report/Case Presentation \n  \nThe patient was a 76-year-old woman who had been suffering from Parkinson disease for 5 years. She had Stage III disease, as assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) Scale, and exhibited a stable condition under the control of l-dopa and dopamine agonists. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient became speechless gradually and spent most of the day in bed. Thus, she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluations. The patient exhibited worsening of bradykinesia and cogwheel rigidity. She required guardian's support for everyday life and was diagnosed with H-Y stage IV. She could walk with minimal assistance. Most strikingly, her consciousness level was impaired and estimated to be Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) E3V3M5. Involvement of the cranial nerves or cerebellar dysfunction was not obvious. No clinical evidence obtained at that time indicated the involvement of the spinal cord. In addition to the neurological disturbances, a tumor was observed in the right breast, which was later pathologically proven to be invasive ductal carcinoma. Cranial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed a high-signal-intensity lesion in the right peri- and intralateral ventricle (Fig.  , b). Part of this lesion and the meninges exhibited gadolinium enhancement (Fig.  , d). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination demonstrated the presence of pleocytosis (159 cells/mm ) and an increased protein content (171 mg/dL). A cytological analysis was negative and no significant viral antibody titers were detected. Moreover, no bacterial cultures were obtained. The levels of the myelin basic protein were normal (88 pg/mL; normal <102 pg/mL) and no oligoclonal bands were observed. Anti-AQP-4 antibodies were detected (28.5 U/mL; normal, <3 U/mL) in her serum, whereas various auto-antibodies that indicate paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, such as anti-Yo, anti-Hu, Ro, and others, were negative. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having late-onset anti-AQP-4 antibody-positive NMOSD with invasive ductal carcinoma and 5-year history of Parkinson disease. Optic neuritis was not observed at that time. The patient received pulsed steroid therapy as the initial treatment, which improved her consciousness level significantly, to GCS E4V4M6. The abnormal signal alterations on MRI also improved (Fig.  , f). The results of CSF examination indicating the presence of 32 cells/mm  and an elevated protein contents of 100 mg/dL were considered to represent partial improvement. After the initial pulsed steroid treatment, the patient received total mastectomy and further rehabilitation therapy for Parkinson disease. Two weeks after the mastectomy, she developed abrupt-onset bilateral leg weakness and walking difficulties; therefore, involvement of the spinal cord was suspected. MRI of the spinal cord revealed the presence of multiple spindle-shaped T2 high-signal-intensity alterations that were indicative of myelitis (Fig.  , b). Thus, pulsed steroid therapy was administered again, after which the MRI signal alterations of the spinal cord were reduced (Fig.  ) and the patient's leg muscle strength improved. The patient refused further treatment, such as plasma exchange or other immune-modifying medications. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. \n\n\n## Discussion/Conclusion \n  \nNMOSD is an autoimmune inflammatory central nervous system disorder that is typically associated with longitudinally extensive myelitis and optic neuritis [ ,  ]. Several studies have described the importance of the age at the onset of NMOSD; therefore, clinical differences might exist between late-onset (age at disease onset, >50 years) and early-onset NMOSD (age at disease onset, <50 years) NMOSD. Late-onset NMOSD may often be comorbid with age-related conditions compared with early-onset NMOSD [ ]. Moreover, elderly patients have a tendency for a rapid worsening of their condition and poor response to immunomodulatory therapies [ ,  ]. Therefore, an immediate diagnosis and awareness of the possibility of NMOSD in elderly patients are necessary [ ]. At our institution, 12 cases of anti-AQP-4 antibody-positive NMOSD were confirmed over the past 10 years, with the present case being the oldest patient with NMOSD being followed at our hospital. In this single institution, half of the cases of NMOSD with anti-AQP-4 antibody positivity occurred in patients in their 40s. The age at onset was 50 years in 3 cases and 60 years in 2 cases. There were no other cases of NMOSD with an age at onset >70 years. Moreover, no other NMOSD cases had carcinoma and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease. In our case, we also suspected the paraneoplastic neurological symptom as the differential diagnosis, but various anti-neural-specific antibodies associated with paraneoplastic syndrome were not found [ ]. In addition, the spinal cord involvement developed after the mastectomy. Regarding the paraneoplastic neurological symptoms, the initial treatment consisted in the suppression of tumor activity; therefore, its resection was considered to be most effective. The observation that the patient developed new neurological deterioration because of the spinal cord involvement after tumor removal seemed inconsistent with paraneoplastic syndrome. Band-like lesions in the lateral ventricle and the linear enhancement of the ependymal surface of the lateral ventricle were characteristic MRI findings in this case. The meninges were also enhanced. These MRI abnormalities have been previously reported in patients with NMOSD [ ]. Based on these findings, we considered that the newly emerging neurological symptoms observed in the current patient were caused by NMOSD. \n\nIn conclusion, we described the clinical features of a rare case of very-late-onset NMOSD and attempted to promote awareness of NMOSD in elderly patients with neurological deterioration. \n\n\n## Statement of Ethics \n  \nThe patient provided both oral and written informed consent for the publishing of this report (including images). \n\n\n## Conflict of Interest Statement \n  \nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare. \n\n\n## Funding Sources \n  \nThe authors have no funding sources to disclose. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nY.T. designed the case report and wrote the manuscript.

The authors examined the cerebral perfusion differences among 17 Parkinson disease (PD) patients, 17 PD with dementia (PDD) patients, and 17 healthy controls and used ASL-MRI to assess the effects of dopaminergic therapies on perfusion in the patients. The authors demonstrated progressive widespread cortical hypoperfusion in PD and PDD and robust effects for the dopaminergic therapies. Specifically, dopaminergic medications further decreased frontal lobe and cerebellum perfusion in the PD and PDD groups, respectively. These patterns of hypoperfusion could be related to cognitive dysfunctions and disease severity. Furthermore, desensitization to dopaminergic therapies in terms of cortical perfusion was found as the disease progressed, supporting the concept that long-term therapies are associated with the therapeutic window narrowing. The highly sensitive pharmaceutical response of ASL allows clinicians and researchers to easily and effectively quantify the absolute perfusion status, which might prove helpful for therapeutic planning. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the progressive loss of dopamine neurons, and incidence studies suggest that an annual rate of 10% of PD patients develop dementia (which is sometimes termed PD with dementia (PDD) in such cases).  Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of the rate of disease deterioration is essential for the design and evaluation of new therapies for this disorder. Current neuroimaging studies, including MRI and radiotracer studies (positron emission tomography, PET; single photon emission computed tomography, SPECT) have identified abnormally decreased levels of cortical metabolism and perfusion in PD.  Such alterations have been associated with the PD motor-related pattern and the PD cognitive-related pattern,  suggesting that they could potentially be used as disease biomarkers to assess disease diagnoses, progression, and treatment responses in cases of PD. \n\nAlthough enormous progress has been made in the treatment of PD, including the development of a variety of promising therapies, long-term dopamine replacement therapies as well as the progression of the disease itself might be associated with the gradual development of ineffective motor functional control, the occurrence of adverse drug effects,  and various cognitive impairments.  The association between the direct effects of dopaminergic therapies on brain global/regional perfusion and disease status remains unclear. A previous study, however, has reported that as dementia develops in PD patients, those patients exhibit more widespread cortical hypoperfusion.  By altering dopaminergic neurotransmission, dopaminergic therapy can modulate the cognitive and motor striatal functional networks in healthy individuals and in PD patients.  The spatiotemporal progression of dopamine depletion in PD provides a special model for assessing dopaminergic effects on perfusion in neural systems with different baseline dopamine levels. \n\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive MRI perfusion tool that quantitatively measures cerebral blood flow per unit of tissue mass by taking advantage of arterial water as a freely diffusible tracer.  Arterial spin labelling allows for the acquisition of perfusion data without the fear of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with significant renal insufficiency. The ability to obtain quantification on an absolute scale further allows for easy recognition of diffuse hypoxic/anoxic states and also for assessments of cortical perfusion before and after a given intervention.  Unlike processes involving the use of potentially harmful radioactive materials that require long preparation times, ASL can also be easily repeated in routine MRI studies to safely and effectively investigate disease status and progress in PD. Recent studies have demonstrated its clinical applications in cerebral blood flow quantification in PD. \n\nWe had 3 priori hypotheses for our study: ASL-MRI would indicate cortical hypoperfusion in the subjects with PD and PDD as compared with the normal controls (NC); dopaminergic therapy might alter acute cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in particular brain regions in PD and PDD; and differences in regional perfusion resulting from pharmaceutical effects would predict the baseline or interval changes indicated during clinical evaluations. Our results might help prove the utility of ASL in defining a time window for early interventions against PD. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThe study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital human research committee. All participants or their guardians provided written informed consent before participation in the study. Thirty-four right-handed PD and PDD patients (13 men and 21 women, mean age: 62.18\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.1 years) were prospectively enrolled in the Neurology Department of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were included if they had a definitive diagnosis of idiopathic PD  and had been followed up on at the Neurology Out-Patient Clinic for more than 6 months after titration of their daily dopaminergic medications to a steady dose in accordance with their clinical symptoms. The PDD was diagnosed in accordance with recently published guidelines.  Patients were excluded if they had newly diagnosed PD or had undergone follow-ups for less than 6 months since their daily dose of dopaminergic medications was still under adjustment; other pyramidal signs, severe sensorial impairment, or ataxia; or impaired consciousness or higher brain dysfunction that precluded following instructions. \n\nAll the patients completed 3 tests corresponding to the ON and OFF medication states. All evaluations for the PD and PDD patients, including evaluations of clinical disease status, MRI studies, and neuropsychological tests, were initially assessed in the OFF state achieved by withdrawal of dopaminergic medications 12 to 18 hour before testing. For the ON testing, the study procedures began 1 hour after the patient had taken their daily dopaminergic medications. The daily dose of dopaminergic medications was converted into the equivalent dose of levodopa. \n\nThe disease severity and functional status of each patient were evaluated, as in our previous study,  with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the modified Hoehn and Yahr stages, and the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess the general cognitive functions of the subjects. \n\nThe patients\u2019 mean disease duration, defined as the time since the given patient subjectively noticed his or her first symptoms, was 3.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.7 years. For comparison, 17 sex- and age-matched NC (8 men and 9 women, mean age: 59.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.5 years) with no medical history of neurologic diseases or psychiatric illnesses, alcohol/substance abuse, or head injury, and with similar levels of education, were recruited. These control participants underwent a single testing session without any medication procedure. \n\n\n### Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition \n  \nHigh-resolution T1-weighted (T1W) imaging was performed on a 3.0T scanner (GE Signa MRI, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel head coil. T1-weighted images were acquired using the three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery fast spoiled gradient recalled echo pulse sequence with the following imaging parameters: TR\u200a=\u200a9.5 milliseconds, TE\u200a=\u200a3.9 milliseconds, TI\u200a=\u200a450 milliseconds, flip angle\u200a=\u200a20, field of view\u200a=\u200a256\u200a\u00d7\u200a256\u200amm, matrix size\u200a=\u200a512\u200a\u00d7\u200a512, number of slices\u200a=\u200a110, and slice thickness\u200a=\u200a1.3\u200amm. \n\nPerfusion MRI data was performed on a 1.5T scanner (Discovery MR450, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel head coil. ASL images were acquired using a pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling technique with a background suppressed 3D fast spin echo sequence.  The imaging parameters used were TR\u200a=\u200a4548 milliseconds, postlabel delay\u200a=\u200a1525 milliseconds, TE\u200a=\u200a10.5 milliseconds, matrix size\u200a=\u200a128\u200a\u00d7\u200a128, number of excitations\u200a=\u200a3, number of slices\u200a=\u200a38, slice thickness\u200a=\u200a4.0\u200amm (with whole brain coverage), and total acquisition time\u200a=\u200a4 minutes. Arterial spin labelling perfusion imaging acquires 2 images: 1 image taken shortly after the inflowing arterial spins are inverted (labeled image) and 1 taken without inverting the arterial spins (unlabeled image). Subtracting the labeled image from the unlabeled image produces an ASL perfusion weighted image, which can be converted to a quantitative image that reflects CBF. For each subject, a CBF map was calculated by scanner console with FuncTool 3DASL (Discovery MR450, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) within 1 minute and was reported in mL/100\u200agm/min units. \n\n\n### Image Data Processing \n  \nImaging data were preprocessed using FSL v5.0 (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library;  ) and SPM8 (statistical parametric mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; available online at  ) implemented in Matlab 7.3 (MathWorks, Natick, MA). All T1W and ASL images for each participant were carefully checked by an experienced neuroradiologist to ensure that they included no scanner artifacts, motion problems, or gross anatomic abnormalities. \n\nTo further ensure the accuracy of cross-modality image registration, the unlabeled ASL images and corresponding T1W images of each participant were skull-stripped using the Brain Extraction (BET, part of FSL,  ) Tool v2.1 (BET and BET2; part of FSL) to remove nonbrain tissues and background noise from the images.  For each participant, the brain mask that was generated from the unlabeled ASL images was also applied to the CBF map. We used a boundary-based registration algorithm implemented in FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT, part of FSL  ) to obtain accurate and robust ASL and T1W image alignment.  The high resolution T1W image was used as the reference image of the extracted surfaces to separate tissue types, and then the unlabeled ASL image was aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Subsequently, the CBF maps were mapped into the T1W space by using the transformation. \n\nThe DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) toolbox (part of SPM8,  )  implemented in SPM8 was used to generate group-specific templates for all the subjects based on their segmented gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) probability maps, and each group-specific template was registered into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space using affine transformation. Each individual subject's T1W image was mapped into the MNI space. With these 2 transformations, CBF maps in the T1W space were normalized to the group-specific template and mapped into the MNI space, and resliced to an isotropic voxel size of 1.5\u200amm. Because of the partial volume effect (PVE), CBF maps were corrected for volume atrophy according to the proportion of GM and WM in each voxel obtained from the segmented T1W image.  To eliminate outliers in the perfusion image because of large blood vessels or image processing computations, the threshold was set at a low-value threshold of zero and a high-value threshold of 2 standard deviations above the mean perfusion for each subject.  Finally, the CBF maps after PVE correction were spatially smoothed using a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel for voxel-wise comparisons. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \n#### Analysis of Demographic Data \n  \nThe demographic data, including age, sex, education level, and disease duration, were compared among the study groups using the 1-way analysis of variance test and Pearson \u03c7  test, were appropriate, and were reported as the mean\u200a\u00b1\u200athe standard deviation. Differences in disease severity and levodopa equivalent doses were assessed using the Mann\u2013Whitney   U   test. The MMSE and total intracranial volume (TIV) were analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the participant's age, sex, and education level as covariates. The global tissue volumes, including the GM, WM, and CSF volumes, and global brain mean CBF were analyzed using the ANCOVA model with the participant's age, sex, education level, and TIV as covariates. The associations between the clinical evaluations and the CBF values derived from the differences found via group comparisons were calculated by partial correlation analysis. The threshold for all statistical significance was set at   P  \u200a<\u200a.05. \n\n\n\n### Analysis of Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Differences Between Groups \n  \n#### Comparisons between Normal Controls and Patients in ON and OFF Status \n  \nTo identify CBF differences between NC and patients in the ON and OFF status, smoothed, PVE corrected CBF maps were analyzed with SPM8 using the framework of general linear model . A voxel-wise ANCOVA design was used with age and sex as covariates to remove the possible effect of these parameters. The differences in CBF maps were compared between the following groups: NC versus PD , NC versus PDD , NC versus PD , and NC versus PDD . To prevent possible PVEs between boundaries of different tissue types, a GM mask generated from the group-specific template, including voxels with a GM probability value of less than 0.2 (range from 0 to 1), was excluded. The command-line tool, AlphaSim, which is available in the AFNI toolbox (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages,  ), was used to correct the problem of image-based multiple comparisons. The statistical threshold for each voxel was set at a corrected   P   of 0.05 (whereas   P   was 0.005 with a cluster size of at least 275 voxels), based on the results of the Monte Carlo simulation. The coordinates of the voxels of each significant cluster were transformed from MNI coordinates into Talairach coordinates using the GingleALE toolbox (The BrainMap Development Team;  ). The Talairach and Tournoux atlas ( ) was used to identify the anatomic structures of the Talairach coordinates representing significant clusters. \n\n\n#### Comparisons Between Parkinson Disease and Parkinson Disease With Dementia \n  \nTo compare CBF differences between the PD patients and PDD patients, an ANCOVA design with age, sex, and levodopa equivalent dose as covariates was used for the voxel-wise comparisons between PD  versus PDD  and PD  versus PDD  (  P  \u200a<\u200a0.05). \n\n\n#### Comparison Between ON and OFF Status in Patients \n  \nOne sample   t   test with levodopa equivalent dose as the covariate was used for the voxel-wise comparisons between PD  versus PD  and PDD  versus PDD  (  P  \u200a<\u200a0.05). \n\n\n\n### Relationship Between Cerebral Blood Flow and Clinical Assessments \n  \nThe mean CBF of the clusters with significant differences between ON and OFF status in the PD and PDD groups was extracted for further correlation analyses. Partial correlation analyses with age, sex, and years of education as nuisance covariates were performed to correlate the effect of levodopa equivalent dose on CBF value changes. A further analysis controlling for the levodopa equivalent dose was carried out to evaluate the relationship between interval changes of CBF values and the clinical characteristics (eg, MMSE and clinical disease severity). The threshold for statistical significance was set at   P  \u200a<\u200a0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software (SPSSV.17, Chicago, IL). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic Data \n  \nThe demographic data are summarized in Table  . Using ANCOVA analysis, it was determined that there were significant group differences in the MMSE scores (  P  \u200a<\u200a0.001) and TIV (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.042) among the NC, PD  and PDD  groups. We compared the patients\u2019 performances on the UPDRS between the ON and OFF states using paired   t  -tests. The UPDRS III and UPDRS total scores were significantly worse in the PD  state than in the PD  state (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.001 and   P  \u200a<\u200a0.001, respectively) (data not shown). These results indicate that dopaminergic medications significantly improved the disease severity of the patients, with the improvement being most apparent in terms of motor functions. \n  \nComparisons of Demographic Variables, Clinical Variables, Global Anatomic Measurements, and Cognitive Assessment Results for the Healthy Controls, Parkinson Disease Patients, and Parkinson Disease With Dementia Patients \n  \n\n### Perfusion Deficits in Parkinson Disease Patients and Parkinson Disease With Dementia Patients \n  \n#### Cerebral Blood Flow Quantification \n  \nThe calculated whole brain mean CBF in the control group was 40.84\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.33\u200amL\u00b7100\u200ag \u200amin  (mean\u200a\u00b1\u200astandard deviation) (Table  ). In the PD  and PDD  patient groups, the mean CBF values were 38.93\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.67 and 35.84\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.89, values which were 1% and 9% lower, respectively, than that for the control group. These values are in the range of those for perfusion decreases measured in a recent ASL study of PD.  In the PD  and PDD  patient groups, the mean CBF values were 37.16\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.67 and 34.25\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.09, values which were 9% and 16% lower, respectively, than that for the control group. Using ANCOVA analysis, it was determined that there was no significant group difference of the whole brain mean CBF among the NC, PD  and PDD  groups (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.388), nor was there any significant group difference among the NC, PD , and PDD  groups (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.301). For both the PD group (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.148) and the PDD group (  P  \u200a=\u200a0.112), there were also no significant dopaminergic medication effects indicated via paired   t  -tests in terms of the whole brain mean CBF values between the ON and OFF states. \n\n\n#### Cerebral Blood Flow Comparisons Between Normal Controls and Patients in ON and OFF Status \n  \n##### Normal Controls Versus Parkinson Disease \n  \nThe voxel-wise analysis of the absolute CBF maps revealed no significant perfusion deficits in the PD  patient group (Table   and Figure  A). \n  \nComparisons of Cerebral Blood Flow Levels in Different Brain Regions for Normal Controls and Patients in ON or OFF Status \n    \nRegions with significantly decreased absolute cerebral blood flow in Parkinson disease and Parkinson disease with dementia patients in the ON and OFF status compared with healthy controls (cluster level statistics,   P   value\u200a<\u200a0.05, family-wise error corrected). The color bar indicates the T scores scale. \n  \n\n##### Normal Controls Versus Parkinson Disease With Dimentia \n  \nBilateral perfusion decreases were found in the frontal, parietal, and cerebellar regions in the PDD  group, whereas only small decreases were found in the temporal and occipital areas in that group (Table   and Figure  B). In the frontal lobe, lower perfusion was found in the medial and middle frontal gyri (Brodmann areas 8, 9, and 10), extending from prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex to the mesial surface of hemisphere and the presupplementary motor area. The area of the presupplementary motor area, the caudal portion of the mesial area BA 6, preserved normal cortical perfusion. In the parietal lobe, lower perfusion was found in the superior parietal lobes and precuneus (BA 7). In the occipital lobe, decreases were found in the cuneus, corresponding to the visual cortex. In the temporal lobe, the parahippocampus gyrus was affected (Table   and Figure  B). \n\n\n##### Normal Controls Versus Parkinson Disease \n  \nFor the PD  patient group, the absolute CBF maps revealed significant perfusion deficits in the occipital lobes, parietal lobes, and cerebellum that were not found before the administration of dopaminergic medications (Table   and Figure  C). \n\n\n##### Normal Controls Versus Parkinson Disease With Dimentia \n  \nThe CBF patterns in the PDD  patients also demonstrated similar but more widespread neocortical hypoperfusion patterns than those found in the PD  patients (Table   and Figure  D). Decreased perfusion was also found in subcortical regions, such as the caudate nucleus and thalamus. \n\n\n\n#### Cerebral Blood Flow Comparisons between Parkinson Disease and Parkinson Disease With Dimentia \n  \n##### Parkinson Disease  Versus Parkinson Disease With Dementia \n  \nCompared with the PD patients, the PDD patients had significantly lower CBF values in the frontal lobe, including the medial (BA 9), inferior (BA 47), paracentral (BA 6), and superior frontal lobe (BA 6) regions. The PDD group also exhibited lower CBF in the parahippocampus (BA 30), anterior cingulate (BA 32), and precuneus (BA 7) (Figure  A and Supplementary Table 1). \n  \nClusters with significant group differences in absolute cerebral blood flow between the Parkinson disease patients and the Parkinson disease with dementia patients in the ON and OFF status (cluster level statistics,   P   value\u200a<\u200a0.05, family-wise error corrected). \n  \n\n##### Parkinson Disease  Versus Parkinson Disease With Dementia \n  \nA comparison of the PD  and PDD  groups found no significant differences in CBF for the various brain regions (Figure  B and Supplementary Table 1). \n\n\n\n#### Cerebral Blood Flow Comparison Between OFF and ON Status in Patients \n  \n##### Parkinson Disease  Versus Parkinson Disease \n  \nAfter the administration of dopaminergic medications, the PD group showed significantly decreased CBF in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, 13) (Figure  A and supplementary Table 2). \n  \nRegions with significantly decreased absolute cerebral blood flow values in ON status compared to OFF status in Parkinson disease and Parkinson disease with dementia patients. \n  \n\n##### Parkinson Disease With Dementia  Versus Parkinson Disease With Dementia \n  \nIn patients with PDD, the administration of dopaminergic medications significantly decreased right cerebellar perfusion (inferior semilunar lobule) (Figure  B and Supplementary Table 2). \n\nCerebral Blood Flow Comparison Between OFF and ON Status in Patients. \n\n\n##### Correlations With Levodopa Equivalent Dose \n  \nIn the PD patients, the decrease in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status in the left inferior frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with higher daily levodopa equivalent doses (r\u200a=\u200a-0.743,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.001). In the PDD patients, the decrease in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status in the right cerebellum was also negatively correlated with higher daily levodopa equivalent doses (r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.616,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.008) (Figure  ). \n  \nEffect of dosages of dopaminergic medications on regional cerebral blood flow changes (with age and sex as covariates), and correlations between mini-mental state examination scores in OFF status and regional cerebral blood flow changes after dopaminergic medications (with age, sex, education, and levodopa equivalent dose as covariates) (L, left; R, right; IFG, inferior frontal gyrus). \n  \n\n##### Correlations With Mini-Mental State Examination in the OFF Status \n  \nControlling for the levodopa equivalent dose, the decrease in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status in the right cerebellum was also positively correlated with lower MMSE scores (r\u200a=\u200a0.515,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.041) in the PDD group (Figure  ). For the PD group, in contrast, there was no statistically significant correlation between the MMSE scores and the change in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status. \n\n\n##### Correlations With Clinical Disease Severity in the OFF Status \n  \nControlling for the levodopa equivalent dose, there was no statistically significant correlation between the clinical severity assessment results and the changes in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status for the various brain regions in the PD group. In the PDD group, however, the decrease in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status in the right cerebellum was associated with higher disease severity (UPDRS I, r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.506,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.045; UPDRS III, r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.501,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.049; H&Y stage, r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.522,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.038; Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale, r\u200a=\u200a\u22120.583,   P  \u200a=\u200a0.018) (Figure  ). \n  \nCorrelations between disease severity in OFF status and regional cerebral blood flow changes after dopaminergic medications (with age, sex, education, and levodopa equivalent dose as covariates). \n  \n\n##### Correlations With Clinical Disease Severity in the ON Status \n  \nFor both the PD and PDD groups, there was no statistically significant correlation between the clinical severity assessment results and the changes in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status for the various brain regions. \n\n\n##### Correlations With Interval Changes of Clinical Disease Severity (OFF\u2013ON) \n  \nFor both the PD and PDD groups, there was no statistically significant correlation between the degree of clinical severity improvement and the changes in CBF values from the OFF status to the ON status for the various brain regions. \n\n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Summary \n  \nConsistent with our hypothesis and in line with the extant literature, the PD patients and PDD patients experienced progressive cortical hypoperfusion in comparison with the NC. In particular, we also found evidence of dosage-dependent pharmaceutical effects of the dopaminergic therapies on cerebral perfusion in different vulnerable brain regions in the PD and PDD patients. Furthermore, by linking the immediate changes in CBF before and after dopaminergic treatment with measurements of disease severity and cognitive functions, we demonstrated that the effects of dopaminergic therapies on cortical perfusion might be reduced as the disease progresses. Our results highlight the potential value of using ASL as a global marker of overall impairment and for therapeutic monitoring in PD. \n\n\n### Pathophysiology of Hypoperfusion in Parkinson Disease and Parkinson Disease With Dimentia \n  \nOur results showed extensive cortical perfusion deficits in the PDD patients, regardless of whether those patients were in the ON or OFF status, as well as mild decreases in perfusion in the occipital and cerebellar regions in the PD group patients when they were in the ON status. The neuroimaging findings of past studies regarding cortical perfusion alterations have varied. Although multiple pathophysiologies support the conclusion that perfusion changes occur in PD, differences in the patient populations studied (ie, in terms of sample size, disease severity, and medication status), different data-analysis procedures, and differences in the statistical criteria selected have led to differences among the observations of different studies. Using a relatively optimal and strict analysis threshold combined with various meta-analyses, Borghammer   et al   recently concluded that PD most likely results in widespread cortical hypometabolism, even at early disease stages. \n\nThe underlying mechanism of the extensive reduction of cortical CBF in PD patients remains unknown. The well-known pathologic process in PD is the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, with the consequent reduction of dopamine in the striatum. In addition, Braake   et al   have proposed that the early degeneration of various subcortical structures corresponding to different neuronal systems, including dopaminergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic networks, occurs in PD.  Since those neuronal systems are widespread and connected to different subregions of the striatum and neocortices, it is reasonable that parallel neurodegenerative depletion of these neuron populations and an extensive decrease in cortical perfusion would be observed. Another piece of evidence for an association between the number of existing neurons and cortical perfusion was provided by several studies, in which chemical and electrical stimulations of those neural systems were used to elicit significant increases in regional and global CBF and vasodilatation (Borghammer   et al  ). Our PDD results showing extensive cortical hypoperfusion may well represent the profound loss of neurons involved in these neuronal systems. \n\nAnother finding indicating that no region exhibited hypoperfusion in PD patients in the OFF status seems contradicted by previous reports. There, however, has been some speculation that the cortical hypoperfusion reported in PET and SPECT studies is actually because of a difference in the calculations caused by gray matter atrophy.  In a previous ASL study, regions with cortical perfusion deficits were found to overlap to a high degree with areas of gray matter volume loss determined by voxel-based morphometry.  The major concern regarding perfusion measurements comes from the low degree of spatial resolution and the lack of morphologic information imaging modalities. Since nearly all of the previous PET and SPECT studies of PD did not employ partial volume correction, the results of the current study indicating no obvious cortical hypoperfusion in PD are probably strengthened by the use of PVC, which would lessen the confounding influence of cortical atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results are comparable to those of the existing literature showing that the magnitude of the cortical perfusion decreases in PD are somewhat diminished following PVC.  Nevertheless, another argument is that the cortical hypoperfusion can probably only be partially explained by atrophy.  Lots of volumetric studies have demonstrated no loss of gray matter or less extensive clusters of atrophy in early-stage PD subjects.  In addition, PD exhibits altered functional connectivities, which have previously been shown to be associated with changes in regional/global neurovascular coupling and hemodynamic responses and can precede structural changes.  At present, it is difficult to use a single etiology to completely explain cortical hypoperfusion. \n\n\n### Pharmaceutical Effects of Dopaminergic Therapies on Cortical Perfusion \n  \nComparisons of cerebral blood flow between PD  versus PD  and PDD  versus PDD  revealed decreased perfusion after the administration of dopaminergic medications in brain regions that are known to be functionally and anatomically connected to different subregions of the striatum.  In the current study, dopaminergic medications significantly decreased inferior frontal lobe perfusion in PD patients as well as cerebellar perfusion in PDD patients. These diminished perfusion levels were partially in line with a previous functional MRI study indicating that the functional connectivities between the ventral striatum, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum were down-regulated by levodopa. That study also, however, found hyperconnectivity in patients with levodopa OFF status compared with controls,  whereas the cortical perfusion was decreased in the current study. Compared with the normal subjects, the PD  patients showed hypoperfusion in the precuneus and occipital lobes, findings which were somewhat similar to previous results indicating that levodopa disrupts ventral striatal and dorsal caudate functional connectivity with the default mode network in healthy adults.  It is still difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the relationship between changes in regional cortical perfusion and the cortico-striatal functional network during dopaminergic medication. According to previous reports, the pathologic state of dopamine depletion is associated with increased synchronous oscillatory activity in the cortico-striatal networks.  In contrast, dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation were demonstrated to eliminate these increases in coherent neural activity across networks with clinical improvement.  The decrease in cortical perfusion might thus reflect a decrease in the energetic need for cortico-cortical synchronous oscillatory activity after dopamine resupply. \n\nSpecifically, we found that dopaminergic therapy reduced cortical perfusion in different anatomies in the PD and PDD groups. According to the Braak model, alpha synuclein is deposited in specific brain regions and neuronal types, giving rise to Lewy pathology in a stereotypic, temporal pattern that ascends caudo-rostrally from the lower brainstem through susceptible regions of the midbrain and forebrain and into the cerebral cortex.  In addition, a recent study reported that brain atrophy occurs in early PD in inferior frontal regions related to primary olfactory and/or secondary integrative olfactory processing, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.  Furthermore, frontal lobe hypometabolism might exceed gray matter atrophy in the early stages of PD with mild cognitive impairment.  Therefore, treatment effects in early PD might substantially contribute to the down regulation of fronto-striatal hyperconnectivity with subsequent lessening of the need for cortical perfusion in the frontal lobe. \n\nOur results were consistent with those of a previous study showing a decline of frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal perfusion in PDD  patients compared with the PD  patients.  This can be explained by the fact that PD is associated with better dopaminergic function reserves in the fronto-striatal and mesolimbic system than PDD is. Increasing evidence suggests that the major role of the cerebellum in PD is likely to include both pathologic and compensatory effects. In contrast to the functioning of the frontal lobes, which present in the preclinical or early stages of PD with lesions and corresponding frontal lobe symptoms, the pseudo-normal cerebellar functioning of PD patients is actually because of a balance between the effects of lesions, compensation by the cerebellum, and dopaminergic effects.  Strengthened connections between cortico-cerebellar motor regions have previously been shown to counterbalance weakened striatal-cortical and striatal-cerebellar connections to compensate for basal ganglia dysfunction.  Extensive neocortical degeneration with a decrease number of dopamine neurons in PDD weakens the capacity to respond to the dopaminergic treatment with neocortical perfusion. Therefore, a compensatory increase in the cortico-cerebellar connections or a hyperactive cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop in PDD may help to maintain better motor and nonmotor functions. Levodopa had been shown to decrease functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and cerebellum,  which might be associated with cerebellar hypoperfusion in PD  patients. Nonetheless, further research is needed to support this concept. \n\n\n### Desensitization to the Effects of Dopaminergic Therapies on Cortical Perfusion as the Disease Progresses \n  \nThe disabling \u201con-off\u201d fluctuations are among the most frequent and troublesome complications of chronic levodopa therapy in PD. In addition to investigating the responses of the main anatomies to dopaminergic medications, we also explored whether alterations in their cortical perfusion were inversely related to dosages. Furthermore, higher disease severities, including poorer motor and cognitive functions, were strongly associated with lower cortical perfusion responses to dopaminergic medications even after controlling for differing dosages of the medications. Our results were compatible with the general concept that supplying dopamine pharmaceutically over a long period of time is associated with a narrowing of the therapeutic window.  The G protein-coupled receptors phosphorylation and down regulation can be associated with a loss of response to dopaminergic treatments when a given drug is administered repeatedly.  Since PD and PDD both revealed an inversed dosage related cortical perfusion response, the desensitization of dopaminergic receptors might partially explain the current findings. \n\nIn addition, our perfusion results might indicate deteriorating presynaptic functions of dopamine neurons because of a decrease in dopamine neuronal survival. Dopaminergic drugs, such as levodopa, are potentially toxic to dopaminergic neurons.  Two studies of patients with PD have evaluated the effect of levodopa compared with a dopamine agonist on surrogate neuroimaging biomarkers of dopamine neuronal function.  Levodopa was demonstrated to be associated with an accelerated rate of decline in biomarker activity compared with the dopamine agonist.  Although dosage-related perfusion changes were observed in both the PD and PPD groups, a significant correlation between perfusion changes and disease severity was only found among the PDD subjects. It is possible that these findings might have resulted from a differential pharmacological effect of the drug on target receptors, since early PD patients are more likely to take dopamine agonists whereas PDD patients are more likely to take levodopa.  Nevertheless, our result might simply reflect the natural degeneration process of PD. Such an effect, however, was difficult to clarify in the current study. \n\nThe interpretation of the findings here must be tempered by some of the limitations of the current study. First, the number of subjects was relatively small. It is possible that our results could not be regenerated in all disease spectrums. There were also mild imbalances in the mean age and mean disease duration for the PD and the PDD patients who might have confounded the statistical analysis. Our results need to be replicated. Much larger sample sizes may permit the identification of perfusion effects specific to degeneration versus dementia subpopulations. Furthermore, the direct effect of different dopaminergic medications on cortical perfusion and their characteristic patterns in this study are unknown because all medicated patients were assessed and imaged with no disruption to their normal drug regimens. Since all the patients underwent MRI scanning under a stable medication control condition (ie, when continuing the same dopaminergic medications for at least 3 months), our group contrasts reveal different disease severities rather than different medication effects. This topic awaits further investigation. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nIn conclusion, we noninvasively explored PD- and PDD-related cortical blood flows via ASL. The perfusion patterns were characterized by extensively decreased neocortical and preserved subcortical perfusion. The development of dementia in PD further worsens the perfusion status. In addition, the highly sensitive temporal responses to the direct effect of dopaminergic medications shown by ASL allow clinicians and researchers to easily, safely, and effectively quantify the absolute perfusion values. The availability and repeatability of ASL might prove useful for therapeutic planning and offer a useful platform for translation research, particularly in clinical trials of new antiparkinsonian therapies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4748867, "text_md5": "3325fc6c5b8ee6dc6a2a0f2d6d92b995", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 208], "journal": [209, 229], "publication_year": [231, 235], "title": [246, 414], "keywords": [428, 428], "abstract": [441, 1757], "body": [1766, 39559]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26844450, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000002206", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748867", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4748867"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748867\">4748867</a>", "list_title": "PMC4748867  Dopaminergic Therapy Modulates Cortical Perfusion in Parkinson Disease With and Without Dementia According to Arterial Spin Labeled Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}

Although DCM may occur in symptomatic WPW patients with sustained tachyarrhythmias, emerging evidence suggests that significant left ventricular dysfunction may arise in WPW in the absence of incessant tachyarrhythmias. An invariable electrophysiological feature in this non-tachyarrhythmia type of DCM is the presence of a right-sided septal or paraseptal accessory pathway. It is thought that premature ventricular activation over these accessory pathways induces septal wall motion abnormalities and ventricular dyssynchrony. LV dyssynchrony induces cellular and structural ventricular remodelling, which may have detrimental effects on cardiac performance. This review summarizes recent evidence for development of DCM in asymptomatic patients with WPW, discusses its pathogenesis, clinical presentation, management and treatment. The prognosis of accessory pathway-induced DCM is excellent. LV dysfunction reverses following catheter ablation of the accessory pathway, suggesting an association between DCM and ventricular preexcitation. Accessory pathway-induced DCM should be suspected in all patients presenting with heart failure and overt ventricular preexcitation, in whom no cause for their DCM can be found. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nClinically relevant arrhythmias are frequently encountered in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome  [ ]. Reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, with orthodromic electrophysiological properties, is the most common arrhythmia in these patients [ ]. A less common clinical manifestation in WPW is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). It has been recognized that recurrent and sustained tachyarrhythmia may induce dilated cardiomyopathy (tachyarrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy) [ , ]. However, our group [ , ], and other investigators [ - ], have recently described another mechanism by which left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and DCM may occur in children and adults with overt ventricular preexcitation. \n\nTwo invariable clinical features associated with this type of DCM are: 1) absence of recurrent and sustained tachyarrhythmias (\"asymptomatic\" WPW), and 2) presence of right-sided accessory pathways, with overt ventricular preexcitation on 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) [ - ]. It is hypothesized that premature ventricular activation over this type of accessory pathway induces abnormal ventricular septal movement, LV dyssynchrony, LV remodelling and subsequently DCM [ - ]. This review summarizes the clinical and electrophysiologic evidence for this association, describes the electrophysiological properties of the accessory pathways, and discusses the management, treatment and clinical outcome of patients with \"asymptomatic\" WPW who develop LV dysfunction or DCM. \n\n\n## Prevalence of DCM and LV dysfunction in WPW \n  \nThe exact prevalence of DCM and LV dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic WPW is unknown. Only 27 cases of accessory pathway-induced DCM have been reported thus far [ - ]. The clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of these patients are summarized in  . In our institution, we have seen 10 children with DCM and asymptomatic WPW during the last 10 years. However, it seems likely that this incidence has been underestimated. Approximately 27% of patients with WPW have a right-sided septally located accessory pathway [ ], suggesting that some patients might have undergone an electrophysiological study (EPS) and catheter ablation before DCM developed. It is also possible that many patients have been incorrectly diagnosed to have idiopathic DCM. \n\nLV dysfunction has been described in more than 50% of patients with right-sided septal accessory pathways [ , ]. Although prospective studies are lacking, small case series show that LV dysfunction in these patients may progress over time  [ - ]. It is hypothesized that newer echocardiographic techniques for regional and global myocardial function quantification, such as tissue Doppler imaging or Speckle Tracking echocardiography  [ ], may demonstrate a much higher incidence of (subclinical) LV dysfunction in asymptomatic patients with right-sided septal accessory pathways. \n\n\n## Pathophysiology \n  \nAt present, the pathogenic mechanism for the development of LV dysfunction and DCM in patients with asymptomatic WPW has not yet been fully elucidated. Interestingly, a right-sided septal or paraseptal accessory pathway has been documented in all patients with overt ventricular preexcitation who developed LV dysfunction or DCM in the absence of recurrent tachyarrhythmias  [ - ]. This finding suggests that the location of the accessory pathway is an important feature in the pathogenesis of this disorder. \n\n### Abnormal septal and ventricular wall motion in WPW \n  \nWPW is a disorder of normal cardiac conduction. It is characterized electrocardiographically by presystolic depolarization and contraction of a part of the ventricular myocardium via an accessory pathway. The effects of premature ventricular activation on cardiac wall motion and global ventricular function has intrigued cardiologists  [ - ]. Attempts have been made to study premature ventricular contraction patterns and wall motion using a variety of non-invasive modalities [ - ]. These studies have made several important observations with regard to normal and abnormal ventricular wall motion in WPW syndrome [ - ]. \n\nLeft-sided accessory pathways may produce a typical premature anterior motion of the LV posterior wall, which can be identified on M-mode echocardiography as a small, distinct bump in early systole of the LV posterior wall [ ]. On the other hand, right-sided accessory pathways may induce septal wall motion abnormalities, with similarities to those septal motion abnormalities seen in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) [ ]. The abnormal septal motion pattern in patients with right-sided preexcitation consists of an early systolic posterior movement, a subsequent midsystolic anterior movement, with a delay in the usual late systolic septal movement. In the majority of these patients, the second posterior septal movement is interrupted by a prominent septal notch [ ]. Although LV function was not measured in the earlier studies, it was found that the degree of abnormal ventricular contraction was dependent on the location of the accessory pathway in the heart  [ - ]. \n\n\n### Right sided accessory pathways and LV function \n  \nRecently, several investigators have demonstrated reduced systolic LV function in patients with right- sided septal and paraseptal accessory pathways [ , ]. A lower LV ejection fraction was noted in 56% of patients with septal and paraseptal accessory pathways [9]. In a study by Know et al. [ ], systolic function was reduced in all patients with septal pathways, compared to patients with left or right-sided free wall pathways. \n\nAn important clinical finding is that cardiac function improves and normalizes in patients with LV dysfunction or DCM, following loss of ventricular preexcitation, either spontaneously or due to cardiac catheter ablation or medical therapy [ - ]. Moreover, several reports have shown an acute increase in LV systolic function directly following catheter ablation of the septal accessory pathway [ - , ]. LV reverse remodelling and complete recovery of cardiac function occurs in the first weeks after loss of ventricular preexcitation [ - , ], further supporting the pathogenic concept of accessory pathway-induced LV dysfunction and DCM. \n\n\n### Detrimental effects of ventricular dyssynchrony on cardiac function \n  \nSeptal accessory pathway-induced ventricular dyssynchrony is an important feature in the development of LV dysfunction and DCM [ , , ]. We observed that the degree of dyssynchrony increased during follow-up in patients with asymptomatic WPW who subsequently developed DCM [ ]. This pathogenetic concept is further supported by recent clinical and experimental work, demonstrating the detrimental effects of LV dyssynchrony on cardiac performance [ - ]. \n\nAs timing is crucial for synchronous ventricular contraction and regional myocardial function, a delay in electrical activation of a myocardial segment, due to left bundle branch block (LBBB), right ventricular apical pacing, or chronic heart failure, may contribute to cardiac pump inefficiency [ - ]. Using tagged-MRI, Prinzen et al. [ ] demonstrated in a canine model of LV dyssynchrony that systolic strain and wall stress, as well as external work are reduced in early-activated myocardial regions and increased in late-activated regions. This study explained why the energy generated by myocardial regions which are shorthening is absorbed by stretched regions, rather than resulting in propogation of blood or pressure generation. This change in strain and wall stress may result in wall motion abnormalities, myocardial perfusion defects, changes in coronary blood flow and regional molecular abnormalities, increased LV cavity volume, and asymmetrical changes in LV wall thickness, leading to reduced systolic cardiac function and heart failure  [ - ]. \n\nTwo recent studies used conventional echocardiographic and speckle tracking imaging methods to quantify LV dyssynchrony in patients with WPW and septal accessory pathways [ , ]. Pre-ablation, most patients with septal accessory pathways showed significant LV dyssynchrony. Not surprisingly, LV dyssynchrony disappeared following catheter ablation (electrical resynchronization) with subsequent increase in systolic cardiac function [ , ]. It was further hypothesized that early septal activation induces dyskinetic/dyssynchronous septal motion, analogous to right ventricular apical pacing-induced LBBB [ , , , ]. This dyssynchronous septal myocardial segment may function much like an aneurysm. This so-called aneurysm may induce adverse LV remodelling with progressive dilation, with DCM as the most severe complication of septal accessory pathway-induced dyssynchrony [ - ]. These clinical studies further support the importance of dyssynchrony in the pathogenesis of LV dysfunction in patients with ventricular preexcitation. \n\nHowever, not all patients with ventricular preexcitation and right-sided accessory pathways seem to be at risk for developing severe LV dysfunction or DCM. Possibly, the degree of pathway-induced LV dyssynchrony is an additional risk factor in these patients. Recent work suggests that different types of septal accessory pathways may induce a variable degree of LV dyssynchrony [ - , ]. Interestingly, LV dysfunction was more pronounced in patients with septal and superoparaseptal pathways compared to patients with an inferoparaseptal pathway, probably due to a higher degree of pathway-mediated LV dyssynchrony [ ]. However, this hypothesis warrants further prospective clinical studies. \n\n\n\n## Clinical management and treatment \n  \n### Patients with WPW and DCM \n  \nAs with all forms of heart failure and DCM in pediatric and adult patients, the underlying diagnosis must be considered. All patients should undergo standard electrocardiographic and echocardiographic assessment. Although there are certain age-related differences in the diagnostic work-up, the approach has to be individualized, depending on clinical findings, age and family history. A comprehensive summary of various important aspects in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with DCM have been well reviewed elsewhere [ , ]. In general, septal accessory pathway-induced DCM should be suspected in all patients presenting with DCM and overt ventricular preexcitation. This diagnosis is considered when other causes of DCM are excluded, particularly tachyarrhythmia-mediated DCM. \n\nThe prognosis of right-sided accessory pathway-induced DCM is excellent, when the diagnosis is suspected early in the clinical course and appropriate therapy is initiated [ - ]. The primary therapy for patients with asymptomatic WPW and accessory pathway-induced DCM is catheter ablation of the accessory pathway [ , ]. Cardiac catheter ablation has been proven an effective and safe therapy for patients with WPW-syndrome [ , ]. This approach is supported by the rapid normalization of cardiac function after loss of ventricular preexcitation. \n\nAlthough catheter ablation is now considered as the standard therapy in adults and children > 12 kg with tachyarrhythmias [ , , ], it may be associated with an unacceptable risk of complications in infants and small children. Due to these safety concerns, an alternative therapy may be offered in this pediatric age-group. Cadrin-Tourigny et al. described two small infants with septal accessory pathway-induced DCM who were successfully treated with amiodarone [ ]. In both patients, pharmacological suppression of ventricular preexcitation was achieved within 3 months after amiodarone was started. LV function improved in both cases. \n\n\n### Patients with WPW and LV dysfunction \n  \nMany asymptomatic patients with WPW and septal accessory pathways have LV dysfunction [ , ]. The extent of LV dysfunction can nowadays be accurately quantified using tissue Doppler imaging or 2D speckle tracking echocardiography [ ]. In our institution, we use 2D speckle tracking imaging to quantify global and regional myocardial function, and degree of ventricular dyssynchrony.   and   show an example of this approach in a child with asymptomatic WPW and LV dysfunction. Although the therapy of choice in these patients is not yet known, close echocardiographic monitoring of cardiac size and function is mandatory. It seems reasonable that catheter ablation should be reserved for those patients in whom progression of adverse LV remodelling, dyssynchrony and deteriorating cardiac function are demonstrated during follow-up. \n\nAnother interesting aspect in the clinical management of patients with WPW and LV dysfunction is whether QRS duration can be used for assessment of degree of ventricular dyssynchrony. Recent reports have shown an increased QRS duration in patients with septal and paraseptal accessory pathways [ , ]. However, this observation was not confirmed in our studies [ , ]. Therefore, QRS duration alone cannot identify all patients at risk for DCM. This may be particularly true for children, in whom intracardiac conduction velocities may be more rapid. Other non-invasive methods should be included in the risk stratification of these patients. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAccessory pathway-induced DCM is a newly recognized form of LV dysfunction in asymptomatic WPW patients with right-sided pathways, in the absence of incessant tachyarrhythmias. Right-sided accessory pathways mediate ventricular dyssynchrony, inducing adverse remodelling and DCM. With loss of ventricular preexcitation, either spontaneously or after catheter ablation, LV function reverses completely. The prognosis of accessory pathway-induced DCM is excellent. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2880871, "text_md5": "4665ff06c676b65ae16906bb52013180", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 113], "journal": [114, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 302], "keywords": [316, 443], "abstract": [456, 1793], "body": [1802, 15450]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 20552060, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880871", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2880871"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880871\">2880871</a>", "list_title": "PMC2880871  Dyssynchronous Ventricular Activation in Asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome: A Risk Factor for Development of Dilated Cardiomyopathy"}

Carriers of single heterozygous mutations may manifest subtle signs of disease, thus providing a unique model of preclinical PD. One emerging hypothesis suggests that non-motor symptom of PD, such as cognitive impairment may be due to a distributed functional disruption of various neuronal circuits. Using resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI), we tested the hypothesis that abnormal connectivity within and between brain networks may account for the patients\u2019 cognitive status. Eight homozygous and 12 heterozygous carriers of either   PINK1   or   Park2   mutation and 22 healthy controls underwent RS-fMRI and cognitive assessment. RS-fMRI data underwent independent component analysis to identify five networks of interest: default-mode network, salience network, executive network, right and left fronto-parietal networks. Functional connectivity within and between each network was assessed and compared between groups. All mutation carriers were cognitively impaired, with the homozygous group reporting a more prominent impairment in visuo-spatial working memory. Changes in functional connectivity were evident within all networks between homozygous carriers and controls. Also heterozygotes reported areas of reduced connectivity when compared to controls within two networks. Additionally, increased inter-network connectivity was observed in both groups of mutation carriers, which correlated with their spatial working memory performance, and could thus be interpreted as compensatory. We conclude that both homozygous and heterozygous carriers exhibit pathophysiological changes unveiled by RS-fMRI, which can account for the presence/severity of cognitive symptoms. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the population aged over 65 years. The core features of PD include resting-tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability, but non-motor symptoms such as cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric disorders and dysautonomia are also frequently observed [ ]. Relevant for clinical management, cognitive deficits can be present in PD since the early clinical stages, including frontal-executive dysfunction, difficulties with set-shifting, visuospatial deficits, and impairments in learning and memory [ ]. In recent years, researchers have put increasing efforts to clarify the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD and, to this aim, the availability of a condition mimicking preclinical stages in humans is of great interest. Relevant progress in this field has come from studies of mendelian forms of parkinsonism, in particular those recessively inherited. Biallelic mutations in three genes (  Park2  /Parkin,   PINK1  , and less frequently   DJ-1  ) are mainly responsible for a fully penetrant, autosomal recessive PD phenotype (ARPD). ARPD is clinically characterized by early onset, slow progression, excellent response to levodopa, and variable occurrence of additional features such as dystonia at onset, sleep benefit, hyperreflexia and psychiatric symptoms [ ]. Interestingly, single heterozygous mutations in   Park2   and   PINK1   genes can be identified in patients with features indistinguishable from sporadic, late-onset PD, as well as in non-symptomatic individuals [ ]. These mutations are regarded as minor susceptibility factors modulating the risk for developing PD in a multifactorial context. Moreover, there is growing evidence indicating that even non-symptomatic heterozygous carriers (i.e., relatives of patients with biallelic mutations) often present with subtle signs of dopaminergic dysfunction, as demonstrated by Photon Emission Tomography and functional MR imaging (fMRI) [ , ]. These individuals provide therefore a unique model for   in vivo   research into the pre-clinical stages of PD. Additionally, it was shown that carriers of single mutations in   PINK1   or   Park2   genes show a similar phenotype at a brain network level [ ], which is consistent with the closely related dysfunctional effect of gene disruption in several   in vitro   and   in vivo   models [ ]. To date, a few studies investigating the cognitive profile of individuals with ARPD have been published. Three of them have consistently reported that   Park2  -mutated patients perform similarly or even better than non-mutated patients on cognitive testing [ , ]. On the other hand, other studies have described cognitive impairment in patients with   Park2   mutations [ ], as well as non-specific cognitive deficits in healthy heterozygous carriers [ ]. We recently published neuropsychological data from   PINK1   homozygous and heterozygous mutation carriers followed-up for 12 years, based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery (MoCA) and an extensive battery exploring all principal cognitive domains [ ]. Interestingly, all affected homozygotes and 5 out of 14 heterozygotes reported abnormal scores at the MoCA and at tests sensitive to frontal dysfunction, consistently with the dysexecutive syndrome which is typically observed in sporadic PD [ ]. The pathophysiological basis of these non-motor manifestations cannot be completely attributed to dysfunction of the basal ganglia, and may be the consequence of distributed functional disruption in various neuronal circuits [ ]. Against this background, functional imaging studies may provide relevant insights, especially in the absence of macroscopic brain abnormalities. Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) has gained particular value for the investigation of cognitive symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. This non-invasive MRI technique relies on the neural spontaneous blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations to estimate the intrinsic activity synchronization across the entire brain at rest, without requiring any experimental task [ ]. So far, distinct RS-fMRI networks have been identified in healthy subjects [ ], and selective disruptions in their functional connectivity (FC) have been observed in various neurodegenerative disorders including sporadic PD [ ]. In particular, the default-mode network (DMN), whose disruption has been associated to impairment of global cognition [ ], was recently investigated in patients with PD, showing reduced FC in the medial temporal lobe and in the inferior parietal cortex [ ]. Other networks are also likely to be implicated in PD, and might exhibit distinct patterns of abnormalities at different disease stages. For instance, in a genetic variant of frontotemporal dementia, FC was shown to play in distinct networks either a pathogenetic or a compensatory role when assessed at preclinical or clinical stages of disease [ ]. \n\nA key question in PD is to determine whether different RS-fMRI networks interact with each other in determining higher level functions and dysfunctions across disease evolution (i.e., inter-network connectivity) [ ]. The current study aims at investigating the role of dynamic changes across five major networks of interest (i.e., DMN, salience network [SN], executive network [ExN], right and left fronto-parietal networks [rFP] and [lFP]) in determining the cognitive status of individuals with different mutational loads in subjects with ARPD-causative genes. To this purpose, we recruited homozygous (HOM) and heterozygous (HET) carriers of either   PINK1   or   Park2   mutations. In the frame of this experimental model, we attempted to clarify the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD when moving from preclinical, or very early (HET individuals) to overt disease stages (HOM individuals). From a clinical/neuropsychological viewpoint, our prediction was to identify visuospatial memory deficits, which are typical of PD, in HOM individuals. Conversely, in HET individuals, we expected to identify preclinical FC modifications in the absence of obvious neuropsychological deficits. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nEight HOM patients (5   PINK1   and 3   Park2   mutation carriers; M/F = 6/3; mean age = 51.4, SD = 8.1 years), 12 HET relatives (10   PINK1   and 2   Park2   mutation carriers; M/F = 5/10; mean age = 40.2, SD = 14.7 years) and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC; M/F = 10/12; mean age = 47.0, SD = 12.3 years) took part in the study (see   for demographic, clinical and pharmacological characteristics). The diagnosis of clinically definite or probable PD was made according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the UK PD Society Brain Bank [ ], with the only exception that positive family history was not considered as an exclusion criterion. Disease severity was estimated by the Hoehn & Yahr stages and the Unified PD Rating Scale [ ,  ]. Major systemic, psychiatric, and other neurological illnesses were carefully investigated and excluded in all subjects. Local Ethical Committee approved the project and written informed consent was obtained by all participants before study initiation. \n   Principal demographic and clinical characteristics of studied subjects.  \nAbbreviations: HET = heterozygous; HOM = homozygous; HC = healthy controls; SD = standard deviation; LEDD = Levodopa equivalent daily dose; UPDRS = Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; MOCA = Montreal Cognitive Assessment; H&Y = Hoehn and Yahr scale. \n      \n\n### Neuropsychological assessment \n  \nCognitive assessment was performed by two trained neuropsychologists on the same day of MRI acquisition. The MoCA [ ] and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) [ ] were administered to all subjects. Additionally, mutation carriers underwent the following battery of tests: 1) Verbal episodic long-term memory: Immediate and Delayed recall of a 15-Word List [ ]; Short Story Recall [ ]; 2) Visuo-spatial episodic long-term memory: Delayed recall of Complex Rey\u2019s Figure [ ]; 3) short-term memory: Digit-span and Corsi Block Tapping task [ ]; 4) Executive functions: Phonological Word Fluency [ ]; Categorical Word Fluency [ ]; Trail Making Test [ ]; Stroop test [ ]; 4) Problem-solving: Raven\u2019s Colored Progressive Matrices [ ]; Praxis: Copy of drawings [ ]; Copy of Complex Rey\u2019s Figure [ ]. For each test, appropriate adjustments for gender, age, and education were applied according to the Italian normative data. In addition, available cut-off scores of normality (95% of the lowest tolerance limit of the normal population distribution) were applied. \n\nSubjects were considered as \u201ccognitively impaired\u201d if they reported pathological scores at MoCA [ ]. Scores obtained at other tests were used to assess group differences between HOM and HET individuals and for correlations with imaging data. In the former case, a series of t-tests for independent samples were used (statistical threshold = p<0.003 after Bonferroni\u2019s correction). \n\n\n### MRI \n  \nAll subjects underwent MRI at 3T (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), including the following acquisitions: 1) Dual-echo turbo spin-echo (TSE) (TR = 6.190 ms, TE = 12/109 ms); 2) fast-FLAIR (TR = 8.170 ms, TE = 96 ms, TI = 2.100 ms); 3) 3D Modified-Driven-Equilibrium-Fourier-Transform (MDEFT) scan (TR = 1338 ms, TE = 2.4 ms, Matrix = 256x224x176, FOV = 250x250 mm , slice thickness = 1 mm); 4) T2*weighted echo-planar image (EPI) sensitized to BOLD contrast (TR = 2080 ms, TE = 30 ms, 32 axial slices parallel to AC-PC line, matrix: 64x64, pixel size = 3x3 mm , slice thickness = 2.5 mm, flip-angle = 70\u00b0) for RS-fMRI. BOLD EPIs were collected during rest for 7 min and 20s, resulting in a total of 220 volumes. \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nDual-echo TSE and FLAIR images were reviewed by a neurologist expert in MRI to assess/exclude the presence of macroscopic abnormalities. \n\nFor each subject the first four volumes of the RS-fMRI series were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM8;  ) was used for image preprocessing and statistical comparison of RS-fMRI data. The preprocessing steps included correction for head motion (using the standard realignment algorithm in SPM8), compensation for slice-dependent time shifts, and co-registration with the corresponding MDEFT. The MDEFT was segmented using the segmentation algorithm in SPM8, and the resulting grey matter (GM) images were used to compute every subject\u2019s total GM volume. The segmentation also provides the normalization parameters that map the subject\u2019s brain into Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates. The same parameters were applied to the motion and slice-timing corrected EPI images. Then, they were filtered by a phase-insensitive band-pass (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) to reduce the effect of low frequency drift and high frequency physiological noise. Finally, smoothing with a 3D-Gaussian Kernel of 8 mm  FWHM was applied. Group Independent Component Analysis (ICA) fMRI Toolbox (GIFT,  ) was used for component decomposition and set to identify 20 independent components. Results were converted to Z-scores. The components were reviewed to identify the DMN, the SN, the ExN, the lFP and the rFP networks [ ]. \n\n\n### Intra-network analysis \n  \nTo statistically evaluate intra-network FC of each selected network, second level analyses were implemented in SPM8 on participants\u2019 reconstructed spatial maps. First, we performed a cross-sectional analysis (with a full-factorial design) with the group of HC, HET and HOM as main factor and GM volume and years of education as covariates of no interest, for each single network separately. Then, a correlation analysis was performed using a two sample T-test, with group belonging (HOM or HET) as factor, the Corsi score as covariate of interest, and the total GM volume and type of genetic mutation (  PINK1/Park2  ) as covariates of no interest. Results were accepted as significant at p<0.05 FWE cluster-level corrected. \n\n\n### Inter-network analysis \n  \nTo statistically evaluate inter-network FC, subject specific network time courses were detrended and pairwise correlated by Pearson's correlation, following an established procedure [ , ]. Briefly, we computed the constrained maximal lagged correlation between all pair-wise combinations of networks. Correlation coefficients and corresponding p values in each pair of networks were calculated for different lags (ranging from -12 to 12), where lags were circularly shifted. The best p value (corresponding to the optimal lag between two networks) was used in the subsequent analysis. To assess between-group differences, correlation coefficients were transformed to z-scores using the Fisher's z-transformation and entered into a between-subject ANOVA with education and total GM volumes as variables of no interest (p<0.05, Bonferroni-corrected). \n\nFinally, in order to investigate the association between inter-network connectivity and severity of cognitive symptoms, we correlated the internetwork z-scores of each pair of networks with cognitive scores, with the total GM volume as covariate of no interest. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical and neuropsychological evaluation \n  \nThere was a statistically significant difference in the average number of years of education between HC and HOM, but not between HET and either HOM or HC. The years of education were subsequently introduced as a covariate of no interest in all fMRI analyses. All other demographic features were matched across groups ( ). \n\nAll HOM patients had a diagnosis of clinically definite PD, as confirmed by the Unified PD Rating Scale ( ). In the HET group, two   PINK1   carriers received a diagnosis of possible PD (subjects F1-IV:13/M and F1-IV:12/M, already reported in a previous publication) [ ]. \n\nWith respect to cognitive assessment ( ), all but two PD individuals (one from the HOM, one from the HET group; carriers of PINK1 mutation in both cases) reported pathological scores at MoCA, and were classified as cognitively impaired. Interestingly, all   Park2   mutation carriers (3 HOM and 2 HET) showed cognitive impairment. When comparing HOM and HET subjects for their performance in single cognitive domains, the former group resulted significantly more impaired in visuo-spatial working memory. \n   Performance scores obtained by HET and HOM individuals on neuropsychological tests.  \nIn brackets cut-off for normative values; in bold characters pathological values.

As expected, the DMN included the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex and the right and left inferior parietal nodes; the rFP and lFP networks included the right/left anterior insula, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the right/left frontal and parietal regions; the ExN included the dorsolateral prefrontal and the posterior parietal cortex; the SN included the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, temporo-parietal junction, angular gyrus, lateral temporal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Between-group comparisons of intra-network connectivity are shown in   and  . \n   Changes in FC in five networks of interest.  \nBrain areas of significant FC alteration in RS-networks (A) and of significant correlation between Corsi score and FC (B) HOM ARPD. \n       Between group FC changes within the RS-fMRI networks of interest.  \nThis figure illustrates between-group differences in functional brain connectivity observed in individual networks: A) the default mode network (DMN), B) the executive network (ExN), and C) the right fronto-parietal network (rFP). In all cases, the networks (main effect of groups) are shown in yellow. Red areas show the regional pattern of reduced connectivity in homozygous mutation carriers (HOM) as compared to healthy controls (HC). Blue areas show the regional pattern of reduced connectivity in heterozygous mutation carriers (HET) as compared to HC. Pink areas show the regional pattern of reduced connectivity in HOM as compared to HET. For each contrast, the signal plots on the right show the group level of connectivity at the peak of some clusters. \n  \nWithin the DMN, both HET and HOM subjects showed lower FC than HC in the precuneus. Within the ExN, HOM patients showed decreased connectivity than HC in the frontal pole bilaterally (a similar finding was detectable, at uncorrected level, also in HOM patients compared to HET individuals). Within the rFP network, HOM patients showed decreased FC in the right angular/supramarginal gyrus when compared to HC, and in the right superior frontal gyrus when compared to HET individuals. \n\nPositive correlations were found between the Corsi scores reported by HOM, but not by HET individuals, and their FC in various networks ( ). Within the rFP, this pattern of correlation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus; within the lFP it was found in the left middle frontal gyrus; in the SN it was localized in the left paracingulate gyrus; and finally, in the ExN, it was localized to the anterior cingulate gyrus. \n   Associations between single network FC and spatial working memory performance in HOM patients.  \nWithin each network (shown in yellow), red areas illustrate the brain regions whose functional connectivity was positively associated with scores reported by homozygous (HOM) mutation carriers at the Corsi test (spatial working memory). These regions included: the left middle frontal gyrus within the left fronto-parietal network (A); the right superior frontal gyrus within the right fronto-parietal network (B); the left paracingulate gyrus within the salience network (C); and the right anterior cingulate gyrus within the executive network (D). \n  \n\n### Inter-network RS-fMRI \n  \nThe inter-network FC correlation was evaluated for ten pairs of networks (resulting from all pair-wise combinations of 5 networks).   summarizes the optimal lag, r, and p vales of correlation for each pair of networks in each group (HC, HET, HOM). \n   Inter-network correlation results.  \nMean lag, Pearson r index and p values of the inter-network FC correlations in the group of healthy controls (HC), HET individuals and HOM patients. \n    \nThree significant differences in the z-values (expressing the strength of between-network correlation in FC) for patients versus controls and between the two genetic groups (HOM and HET) were identified using an ANOVA model with \u201cgroup\u201d as factor. As shown in  , these group differences in inter-network connectivity were found between SN-rFP (F(1,42) = 3.87, p<0.01), DMN-rFP (F(1,42) = 4.10, p<0.01) and SN-DMN (F(1,42) = 3.88, p<0.01). In the case of SN-rFP, the difference was driven by an increased inter-network connectivity in the HOM group compared to both, HC (t(42) = 3.12, p<0.01) and HET individuals (t(42) = 3.04, p<0.01), while no significant difference was found between HC and HET individuals (t(42)<1). In the case of DMN-rFP, the significant main effect was driven by reduced inter-network FC correlation in HOM as compared to HET (t(42) = 2.47, p< 0.05) and an increased connectivity in HET as compared to HC (t(42) = 2.00, p< 0.058). Finally, the difference in the SN-DMN was driven by an increase of inter-network FC in the group of HET compared to both HC (t (42) = 2.12, p< 0.05) and HOM (t(42) = 2.37, p< 0.05), whereas no difference was found between HC and HOM individuals (t(42)<1). \n   Inter-network analysis.  \nPanel A shows the mean (SD) internetwork z scores for each studied group (i.e., healthy controls, HC; homozygous (HOM) and heterozygous (HET) mutation carriers) in three pairs of networks: salience network and right fronto-temporal network (SN-rFP); default mode network and right fronto-temporal network (DMN\u2014rFP); salience network and default mode network (SN-DMN). Asterisks highlight significant between-group differences. Panel B illustrates the significant correlations, obtained in HOM (green-square marks) and HET (red-rhomb marks) mutation carriers altogether, between mean internetwork z scores in SN-rFP and SN-DMN pairs of networks and individual scores obtained at Corsi test (spatial working memory span). \n  \nThe inter-network connectivity z scores were correlated with the performance at Corsi test. In the SN-rFP pair, z scores were negatively correlated with the Corsi scores across the two genetic groups (HOM, HET), indicating that an increase in the connectivity between these two networks (mainly present in the HOM group) was associated with a worse performance in visuo-spatial working memory. \n\nThe inter-network connectivity scores in the SN-DMN and DMN-SN pairs of networks correlated positively with the Corsi score (r = 0.49, p<0.04 and r = 0.48, p<0.04 respectively). An increased connectivity, mainly present in HET individuals, was associated with a better performance in visuo-spatial working memory, indicating possible compensating mechanisms. These correlations are shown in  . \n\nLevodopa treatment is known to potentially affect functional brain connectivity [ ], and therefore constitutes a potential bias in this study, as only the HOM group is under treatment. To estimate the magnitude of this effect, we tested for correlations between individual levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) and FC in all networks of interest in HOM patients (the only group under medication). Within the limitation of our small sample size we were unable to detect any significant association between LEDD and FC. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we recruited subjects carrying single or biallelic mutations in either   PINK1   or   Park2   which, theoretically, may be regarded as a model for preclinical and clinical stages of PD. Mutations in these two genes have been shown to result in a similar phenotype at a brain network level [ ], allowing individuals with   PINK1   and   Park2   mutations to be included in the same experimental setting. \n\nConsistently, all HOM patients responded to a diagnosis of clinically definite PD, while 10 out of 12 subjects from the HET group were classified as clinically unaffected. The focus of this study was to identify, using RS-fMRI, the pathophysiological substrates for the cognitive status of HET and HOM individuals. In sporadic PD, cognitive impairment has been shown to occur since early clinical stages, probably following a long non-symptomatic period of brain compensation. This means that, in our experimental model, HET individuals were expected to be less cognitively impaired than HOM patients. However, consistent with a previous study on   PINK1   mutation carriers (including part of the patients enrolled here) [ ], all but one subjects from either group (HET, HOM) reported pathological scores at MoCA. Moreover, the two cognitively preserved individuals were both   PINK1   heterozygous carriers, while all   Park2   mutation carriers (3 HET, 2 HOM) showed pathological scores at MoCA. This is the first study reporting such a finding in   Park2   mutated subjects, which is apparently in contrast with previous reports [ ,  ]. Nevertheless, as previously suggested, MoCA is highly sensitive in detecting cognitive deficits in PD [ ], and this might account for inconsistences across studies. Additionally, the similar cognitive profile we observed in   PINK1   and   Park2   mutation carriers is congruent with recent neuroimaging studies, suggesting a similar endophenotype for the two genes [ ]. After characterizing the cognitive profile of all recruited subjects, we focused on the patterns of FC, in order to explore potential substrates for their neuropsychological characteristics. We focused our analysis on five specific networks that, according to previous literature [ ,  ,  \u2013 ], have proven to be meaningful in reflecting brain connectivity abnormalities in PD. We first analyzed each network in isolation (intra-network connectivity), and then we explored their interaction (inter-network connectivity) as a function of disease severity. When considering the DMN in isolation, both genetic groups (HOM and HET) compared to controls revealed reduced connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex, with no significant differences between them. This finding fits well with the pathological scores reported by this genetic cohort at MoCA (i.e., a measure of global cognition) irrespective of their group belonging (HOM or HET). The posterior cingulate cortex is regarded as one of the most critical nodes of the DMN, whose connectivity is disrupted proportionally with global cognition not only in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [ ], but also in those with sporadic PD [ ,  ]. Additionally, in patients with both diseases, reduced connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the rest of the brain has been found since early clinical stages, preceding and perhaps contributing to local GM atrophy [ ,  ]. \n\nBeyond the MoCA assessment, HOM patients, compared to HET individuals, performed significantly worse in tests for spatial working-memory. Consistently, HOM patients revealed a remarkable reduction of FC also in other networks (i.e., rFP, ExN), which can be more directly referred to working-memory [ ]. In these same networks, HOM patients could be differentiated not only from HC but also from HET individuals. We speculate that disruption of rFP and ExN parallels the observed disability in more specific areas of cognition. Indeed, spatial working-memory deficits are often reported in sporadic PD, due to both a limited storage capacity and inability to filter out distracting information [ ]. Moreover, we found a direct association between performances at Corsi test by HOM patients and the strength of FC within ExN, SN, rFP and lFP. These networks all involve the frontoparietal cortex and overlap at both the medial and lateral frontoparietal cortex [ ]. Indeed, they are postulated to exert cognitive functions of control [ ], and their implication in working-memory is well described [ ]. \n\nBeyond the role of single networks in specific cognitive functions, interactions between them are likely to account for the appearance of complex symptoms along disease evolution, as well as for compensation mechanisms typically observed in preclinical stages of neurodegenerative dementias [ ]. In a recent work by Gorges and co-authors, different patterns of FC have been reported in patients with PD according to the presence/absence of cognitive impairment [ ]. Cognitively impaired patients showed reduced FC, especially within the DMN. Conversely, cognitively unimpaired patients revealed a widespread increase of FC probably reflecting \u201ccompensatory\u201d mechanisms. \n\nWe first confirmed the negative correlation reported in literature between the DMN and other positive networks [ ,  ]. In normal individuals, greater negative correlations between the DMN and fronto-parietal networks [ ] have been associated with improved performance (and less \u2018\u2018mind wandering\u201d) on tasks requiring externally-directed attention. These negative correlations suggest that the brain may be intrinsically organized to support competitive relationships between networks involved in external attention and internally focused thoughts. When looking at group differences, we found a paradoxical positive correlation between the DMN and SN, rFP and lPF networks in HET individuals only. This might represent a compensatory mechanism of early PD stages, resulting in enhanced communication between the DMN and anterior networks. Indeed, such an effect was not observed in HOM patients. The hypothesis of compensatory processes is further supported by behavioral data showing a better performance in visual short-term working-memory in HET individuals compared to HOM patients. Compensatory mechanisms have already been described in asymptomatic   Park2   and   PINK1   mutation carriers, showing a stronger increase of cortical motor-related activity during execution of self-initiated movements. These changes were interpreted as an evidence for a large-scale reorganization of the motor system in the presymptomatic PD [ ,  ]. \n\nWithin the internetwork analysis, we found a strong effect which was peculiar of HOM patients, with an increase of inter-network connectivity between SN and rFP networks. This finding is of non-obvious interpretation, due to the lack of association with neuropsychological data. However, we argue that such an effect might reflect a compensation mechanism occurring at more advanced disease stages, although further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this interpretation. \n\nWe are aware that the present study suffers from some limitations. First, the number of subjects included in the study is relatively small, due to the fact that autosomal recessive forms of PD are relatively rare. Moreover, HOM but not HET individuals nor HC were under dopaminergic therapy. This could have affected the results by artificially \u201cnormalizing\u201d FC values within specific networks [ ]. Nevertheless, we did not find any significant correlation between functional connectivity and LEDD in HOM patients. While it is of course important to acknowledge this potential confound, most of our findings should not be directly affected by it. \n\nIn conclusion, this study validates the use of RS-fMRI in spotting pathophysiological dysfunctions in ARPD and their relationship with cognitive impairment, especially within the visuo-spatial working memory. Current therapies in PD primarily target the motor symptoms, although cognitive decline is known to affect 15\u201320% of all patients and impact on patients\u2019 and relatives\u2019 quality-of-life. Altered resting-state FC in PD, reflecting clinically relevant phenomena, holds promise as a marker of disease progression. Follow-up of our cohort of mutated subjects will allow us to assess whether changes in FC can serve as a predictor for cognitive decline, especially in HET individuals. The combination of genetic and functional neuroimaging information may prove useful for monitoring individuals at risk for developing PD before the onset of cognitive symptoms, and it is critical for planning neuro-rehabilitation programs. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5082970, "text_md5": "1dbc8eabb23b9fa755eef3101cbadd61", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 244], "journal": [245, 253], "publication_year": [255, 259], "title": [270, 368], "keywords": [382, 382], "abstract": [395, 2194], "body": [2203, 32865]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 27788143, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0163980", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082970", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5082970"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082970\">5082970</a>", "list_title": "PMC5082970  Brain Connectivity Changes in Autosomal Recessive Parkinson Disease: A Model for the Sporadic Form"}
{"text": "Siddiqui, Irum Javaid and Pervaiz, Nashaiman and Abbasi, Amir Ali\nSci Rep, 2016\n\n# Title\n\nThe Parkinson Disease gene SNCA: Evolutionary and structural insights with pathological implication\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nAfter Alzheimer, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Alpha synuclein (SNCA) is deemed as a major component of Lewy bodies, a neuropathological feature of PD. Five point mutations in SNCA have been reported so far, responsible for autosomal dominant PD. This study aims to decipher evolutionary and structural insights of SNCA by revealing its sequence and structural evolutionary patterns among sarcopterygians and its paralogous counterparts (SNCB and SNCG). Rate analysis detected strong purifying selection on entire synuclein family. Structural dynamics divulges that during the course of sarcopterygian evolutionary history, the region encompassed 32 to 58 of N-terminal domain of SNCA has acquired its critical functional significance through the epistatic influence of the lineage specific substitutions. In sum, these findings provide an evidence that the region from 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding alpha helix domain of SNCA is the most critical region, not only from the evolutionary perspective but also for the stability and the proper conformation of the protein as well as crucial for the disease pathogenesis, harboring critical interaction sites. \n \n\n# Body\n \nPD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer which affects 1\u20132% of the population above age 65 and 4\u20135% above age 85 . It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from substantia nigra (a brain structure located in the mesencephalon that plays an important role in reward, addiction, and movement) and the presence of intracellular inclusions i.e. lewy bodies and lewy neuritis . Symptoms of PD include shaking, tremors, bradykinesia and difficulty with walking and gait. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and emotional problems. SNCA is considered as the major causative gene involved in the early onset of familial Parkinson\u2019s disease (FPD) characterized by five missense mutations identified so far i.e. A30P , E46K , H50Q , G51D  and A53T . SNCA is also deemed to be involved in various other neurodegenerative disorders i.e. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Lewy bodies\u2019 disease (LBD) and Muscular System Atrophy (MSA) . \n\nSNCA is a 14.5 kDa, 140 a.a protein encoded by 5 exons with total transcript length of 3041\u2009bps maps on 4q21.3-q22. The other members of synuclein family are SNCB and SNCG mapped to human chromosome 5q35 and 10q23.2-q23.3 respectively . Architecture of SNCA protein reveals the presence of N-terminal region composed of incomplete KXKEGV motifs, extremely hydrophobic NAC domain and highly acidic C-terminal domain . At physiological conditions, SNCA is believed to be intrinsically disordered monomer or helically folded tetramer . Oligomeric structure of SNCA is considered as a toxic form but recent observation abolished this hypothesis . During the past two decades several hypotheses exist about toxic structural form of SNCA, but none of them are completely consensual. However, neurotoxic form of SNCA aggregates within neuron and spreads across the anatomically interconnected regions of PD brain through interneuronal transmission using various mechanisms . Although SNCA is expressed predominately in brain, it is also expressed in heart, skeletal muscle and pancreas . Molecular function of SNCA is quite ambiguous. Based on its structure, physical properties and interacting partners, several hypotheses for the normal function of SNCA have been proposed. It is considered to be involved in regulation of dopamine release and transport, induces fibrillization of microtubule associated protein tau, and exert neuroprotective phenotype in non-dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting both p53 expression and transactivation of proapoptotic genes leading to decreased caspase-3 activation . However, missense mutations (especially A53T) in SNCA abolished the neuroprotective effect of SNCA and promote apoptosis by reversing the expression of p53 . \n\nDue to the significant role of SNCA in FPD and other neurodegenerative disorders, this study was premeditated to decipher the molecular evolution of SNCA, which infers the phylogenetic history of synuclein family with the help of its putative orthologs and paralogs. Analysis revealed the sarcopterygian specific origin of SNCA which suggested its lineage specific functional role. On account of this interest, a comparative sequence and structural analysis was performed to estimate the selection and functional constraints on SNCA. Evolutionary rate difference was coupled with structural information to infer potential functional changes and the impact of lineage specific substitutions. In addition variations in domain topologies were explored by comparative analysis of known functional domains of SNCA protein. In light of the findings, it was hypothesized that the region from 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding domain is the most   \u201ccritical region\u201d   of SNCA from evolutionary, functional and disease pathogenesis perspective. \n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Sequence collection \n  \nPutative paralogs of human SNCA were determined by Ensembl Genome Browser  using Ensembl paralogy prediction. The closest putative orthologs were obtained by BLASTp  bidirectional searches against protein database available at Ensembl and National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Confirmation about ancestral-descendents relationship among putative orthologs was done through clustering of homologous proteins within phylogenetic trees. Sequences whose position within a tree was sharply in conflict with the uncontested animal phylogeny were excluded. The list of all used sequences (protein sequence data) is given as  . \n\nSpecies that were selected includes   Homo sapiens   (Human),   Pan troglodytes   (Chimpanzee), Mus musculus (Mouse),   Rattus norvegicus   (Rat),   Gallus gallus   (Chicken),   Canis familiaris   (Dog),   Equus caballus   (Horse),   Loxodonta Africana   (Elephant),   Dasypus novemcinctus   (Armadillo),   Anolis carolinensis   (Lizard),   Pelodiscus sinensis   (Chinese softshell turtle),   Xenopustropicalis   (Frog),   Latimeria chalumnae   (Coelacanth),   Danio rerio   (Zebrafish),   Takifugu rubripes   (Fugu),   Tetraodon nigroviridis   (Tetraodon),   Gasterosteus aculeatus   (Stickleback),   Oryzias latipes   (Medaka). \n\n\n### Sequence analysis \n  \nThe phylogenetic tree of SNCA family was reconstructed by using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method , complete deletion option was used to exclude any site which postulated a gap in the sequences. Poisson corrected (PC) amino acid distance and uncorrected proportion (p) of amino acid difference were used as amino acid substitution models. Because both methods produced similar results, only results from NJ tree based on uncorrected p-distance are presented here. Reliability of the resulting tree topology was tested by the bootstrap method  (at1000 pseudo replicates) which generated the bootstrap probability for each interior branch in the tree. Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was also constructed by using the Whelan and Goldman  (WAG) model of amino acid replacement (see  ). \n\nAncestral SNCA sequences were inferred by using ML method and WAG model of amino acid substitution. To investigate selection constraint within hominoids (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), non-hominoids (macaque, marmoset, squirrel monkey, bushbaby), non-primate placental mammals (mouse, dog, cow, elephant) and non-mammalian tetrapods (chicken, turtle, frog, coelacanth), z-test was implemented with MEGA . dN-dS rate analysis was also conducted for each of the above mentioned group with the help of Goldman And Yang  (GY-94) method in Hyphy which estimates synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates through codon based model . Evolutionary rate differences of putative paralogs (SNCB & SNCG) were also assessed among sarcopterygians. \n\nDomains, motifs and sub-motifs have been assigned to human SNCA as described previously . ClustalW2 based multiple sequence alignments were used to map the putative positioning of these domains and motifs to paralogs of SNCA protein in human and its orthologs in various sarcopterygian species . Location and the positioning of the identified domains and motifs were also plotted. Substitutions that have occurred within sarcopterygians during evolution were assigned to human SNCA with the help of ancestor reconstruction technique. Previously reported human specific mutations involved in familial Parkinson\u2019s disease were also mapped. Negatively constrained residues of SNCA among sarcopterygians were estimated with Hyphy by implementing Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method which uses global codon model and maximum likelihood to reconstruct the evolutionary history . Impact of the substitutions that have occurred during evolution within sarcopterygians with K /K  <1 were also classified on the basis of their physicochemical properties i.e. charge, volume, polarity into neutral or radical . Human paralogs of SNCA (SNCB & SNCG) were likewise compared and paralogs specific substitutions were identified. \n\n\n### Structural analysis \n  \nFor the structural analysis with evolutionary and functional perspective, NMR structure of human SNCA (1XQ8) was attained from Protein Data Bank (PDB)  and used as a reference for comparative analysis of the structural deviations. After inferring ancestral sequences, sarcopterygian ancestral, mammalian and non-primate placental mammal\u2019s specific SNCA proteins were modeled with the help of Modeller . Structures of the putative paralogs (SNCB & SNCG) of human SNCA were also modelled by comparative homology modelling. Best structures were scrutinized on the basis of Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) score, and then further energy minimization protocol was implemented with chimera  in order to improve the quality of the modeled structures. Quality of the modeled structures were also investigated by Ramachandran  and Errat  plots (see  ). Superimposition of the modeled structures with 1XQ8 was carried out with chimera  and root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were calculated. Quantification of the structural deviations observed in chimera  were further reconnoitered by SPINEX  in terms of quantification of the deviations identified in the backbone torsion angles (phi \u03a6\u00b0, psi \u03a8\u00b0) of the modeled ancestral proteins. Impact of the lineage specific substitutions on the modeled ancestral SNCA proteins were investigated with the help of MuPro  in terms of sequence and structural stability.In order to inspect the structural deviations in the human specific mutations i.e. A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, A53T involved in FPD, mutant models were also generated by Modeller , analyzed and minimized by chimera  and estimated with Ramachandran  and Errat  (see   and  ). \n\n\n### Interaction study \n  \nTo conduct the interaction study, Cluspro protein-protein docking server  was utilized. NMR structure of coiled-coil domain (2KES) of the interacting partner, synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) was obtained from PDB . Domains and motifs reported in literature were assigned to human SNCAIP. Interactions between human specific (1XQ8), sarcopterygian ancestral, mammalian, non-primate placental mammal\u2019s specific and human specific mutant models of SNCA proteins were examined with the help of Ligplot  and PyMol . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Phylogenetic analysis \n  \nEvolutionary relationship between SNCA and its putative paralogs was estimated by NJ and ML methods ( , see  ). Phylogenetic analysis of synuclein family revealed that two duplication events have contributed in diversification of this family. The first duplication event has transpired at the root of vertebrates, prior to tetrapod-teleost split, deduced in SNCG paralog and ancestor of SNCA/SNCB. Whereas the second duplication event has occurred at the root of sarcopterygian\u2019s lineage, after speciation of the teleost fish (SNCA/B) resulted in SNCA and SNCB paralogs. It is also worth noting that the branch lengths for SNCG proteins are longer than those of other two paralogs, suggesting that this paralog may have rapidly evolved in comparison with SNCA and SNCB. Blast based bidirectional similarity searches fail to identify any ortholog of this family among invertebrates which reinforces the assumption of vertebrate specific origin of this family ( , see  ). \n\n\n### Comparing evolutionary rate of SNCA gene among sarcopterygians \n  \nIn order to estimate the evolutionary rate differences of SNCA gene among various clades of sarcopterygians, the orthologs of SNCA from representative members of hominoids (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), non-hominoids (macaque, marmoset, squirrel monkey, bushbaby), non-primate placental mammals (mouse, dog, cow, elephant) and non-mammalian tetrapods (chicken, turtle, frog, coelacanth) were obtained. Non synonymous (K /dN) and synonymous substitution rates (K /dS) were estimated for each group. And then z-test was applied to check selection constraint on the above mentioned groups. \n\nThe K -K  (dN-dS) difference for hominoids was found as \u22122.241 (P\u2009=\u20090.014), non-hominoids was \u22124.716 (P\u2009=\u20090), non-primate placental mammals was \u22126.1777 (P\u2009=\u20090) and non-mammalian tetrapods was \u22127.085 (P\u2009=\u20090) (see  ). In general, K  value lower than K  (K \u2009<\u2009K ) suggests negative selection, i.e. non silent substitutions have been purged by natural selection, whereas the inverse scenario (K \u2009>\u2009K ) implies positive selection i.e. advantageous mutations have accumulated during the course of evolution. However the evidence for positive or negative selection requires the value to be significantly different from each other . Results deduced by z-test (Ka-Ks\u2009<\u20090, p\u2009<\u20090.05) suggests that SNCA has deviated from neutrality during evolution showing the signature of negative selection constraint within sarcopterygian lineage (see  ). \n\nThe evolutionary rate analysis were also performed for putative paralogous copies of SNCA, i.e. SNCB and SNCG. The K -K  (dN-dS) difference for SNCB was identified as \u22121.661(P\u2009=\u20090.05) for hominoids, \u22124.708(P\u2009=\u20090) for non-hominoids primates, \u22125.212(P\u2009=\u20090) for non-primate placental mammals and \u22122.992(P\u2009=\u20090.002) for non-mammalian tetrapods (see  ). The K -K  (dN-dS) difference for SNCG was identified as \u22121.658(P\u2009=\u20090.05) for hominoids, \u22124.064(P\u2009=\u20090) for non-hominoid primates, \u22125.485(P\u2009=\u20090) for non-primate placental mammals, \u22126.306(P\u2009=\u20090) non-mammalian tetrapods and \u22126.341(P\u2009=\u20090) for fishes (fugu, tetraodon, stickleback, medaka) (see  ). This data specifies that not only SNCA but other two members of synuclein family have also been retained under strong purifying selection pressure among the analyzed sarcopterygians. \n\n\n### Domain organization of SNCA \n  \nIn order to gain an insight into comparative domain organization, complete domain annotation of SNCA gene was carried out entailing the orthologs representative from sarcopterygians (human, mouse, dog, chicken, coelacanth) as well as the paralogous copies in human (SNCB and SNCG). This annotation revealed the distinctive architecture of SNCA gene which is comprised of N-terminal A  lipid binding alpha helix domain (1\u201360), Non-amyloid \u03b2 component (NAC) domain (61\u201395) and C-terminal acidic domain (96\u2013140) ( ). \n\nN-terminal lipid binding domain consists of 5 KXKEGV imperfect repeats , and these repeats are identified as highly conserved among analyzed orthologs and paralogs of human SNCA in terms of number and position ( ). This region is predicted to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices, and considered to be involved in interacting with phospholipids . \n\nNAC domain forms the amyloidogenic core of SNCA . NAC comprised of GAV motif with VGGAVVTGV(66\u201374) consensus sequence and three GXXX sub-motifs (where X is any of Gly, Ala,Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Thr, Ser or Met) . Among the analyzed orthologs, NAC was identified as highly conserved. Whereas, among its counter paralogous copies, in SNCB the length of NAC (61\u201384) was reduced due to the absence of one GXXX motif and KXKEGV repeat. While no GXXX sub-motif was identified in SNCG. Among the three putative paralogs, the GAV motif was explicitly present in SNCA only ( ). NAC is considered as extremely necessary for SNCA aggregation and fibrillation . Whereas GAV is surmised as signature motif responsible for this aggregation process . \n\nC-terminal acidic domain harbors copper binding motif containing DPDNEA(119\u2013124) consensus sequence  which was found highly conserved among the analyzed orthologs of SNCA. Multiple sequence alignment failed to identify the conservation of this motif among SNCB and SNCG paralogs ( ). This domain of SNCA is enriched in acidic residues and prolines. Three highly conserved tyrosine residues, which are considered as a subfamily signature of SNCA and SNCB, are also located in this region . It is also proposed that copper binding accelerates the aggregation of SNCA and influences its pathological effects . \n\nLineage specific substitutions that have occurred during evolution among analyzed sarcopterygians have been mapped on human SNCA with the help of ancestor reconstruction technique. It classified that nine substitutions have occurred at the root of mammalian ancestor. While two substitutions occurred at the root of non-primate placental mammal\u2019s lineage and one occurred specifically to the catarrhini\u2019s (hominoids and old world monkeys) lineage ( ) ( ). Out of these 12 substitutions identified, five (S64T, G68E, N87S, L94F, V95G) were found to be confined towards NAC, while six (A101G, F107A, M112I, M113L, P129S, E132G) were residing in the C-terminal acidic domain. Only 1 substitution (T53A) was identified in the N-terminal region ( ). Physicochemical properties of these amino acid substitutions were then analyzed which illustrated that approximately all the substitutions that have occurred during evolution were of radical type except T53A and A101G ( ). This analysis highlights N-terminal lipid binding domain as highly conserved among the analyzed orthologs and paralogs. This finding was further strengthened by the physical positioning of previously reported five human specific mutations associated with familial Parkinson\u2019s disease i.e. A30P , E46K , H50Q , G51D , and A53T  on human SNCA. Results revealed the confinement of these mutations explicitly towards the N-terminal domain which in turn implies the significance of high conservation of this region not only with functional perspective but also for pathogenesis of FPD ( ). With the help of SLAC-window analysis, it appears that N-terminal domain comprised of 15 negatively constrained sites which further advocates that strong selective constraints are operating their role in preserving this region during sarcopterygians evolution ( , see  ). \n\n\n### Structural evolution of SNCA \n  \nTo further inspect how purifying selection is performing its role in defining the spatial constraints on ancestral SNCA proteins at structural level, a comparative structural study was conducted. NMR structure of human SNCA (1XQ8) was taken as a reference and compared with modeled ancestral proteins ( ). Structural deviations were examined with the help of RMSD values ( , see  ). Results revealed very remarkable aspects that were not anticipated by comparative analysis at sequence level. Comparative structural analysis suggests that structure of SNCA has passed through series of transitions to acquire its favored conformation. Superimposed models of ancestral SNCA proteins and 1XQ8 revealed common deviated region encompassed 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding domain of SNCA ( ). These structural deviations were also measured with the help of backbone torsions quantification which highlighted the fact that the region 32 to 58 of SNCA is continuously evolving at structural level, despite of its high sequence conservation ( ). It was also identified that destabilizing substitutions have been incorporated during SNCA evolution with the aim to achieve its intrinsic disordered conformation which implies the functional constraints behind it ( ). So it seems logical to speculate from this structural comparison approach that during SNCA evolution those substitutions have been incorporated which not only caused destabilization of SNCA but also brought drastic structural shift in the identified region. This critical region (32\u201358) was also recognized crucial for the proper conformation of not only N-terminal A  alpha helix domain but for NAC domain as well. With the help of electron and X-ray diffraction techniques it has been reported that normal SNCA assembles through its N-terminal region which again highlights the significant role of this domain . \n\nIntriguingly, all human specific mutations involved in FPD pathogenesis reside in this crucial region which signifies that any change in this region will be deleterious because of the strong selection and functional constraints imposed on it. Superimposed mutant models with 1XQ8 identified major shifts toward lipid binding domain in A30P and H50Q, whereas major change was observed in lipid binding and NAC domains in case of E46K and A53T. Only G51D showed altered NAC region only (see  ). All five mutant models were having highly deviated region from 32 to 58 in common. It can be postulated from this comparative structural analysis that the primary effects and the role of these five SNCA mutations in FPD pathogenesis can be different because of their differential structural morphologies. \n\nFurther to investigate the structural differences among the human paralogs of SNCA, a comparative structural analysis was also conducted. As the NMR structures of human SNCB and SNCG have not been reported so far, their structures were modelled by taking NMR structure of human SNCA (1XQ8) as reference and the structural deviations were assessed (see  ). It appears that SNCB and SNCG structures are highly deviated from SNCA at N-terminal and NAC domain ( ). \n\n\n### Analysis of the interactions between SNCA and coiled-coil domain of SNCAIP \n  \nIn order to investigate further the importance of this critical region, its functional significance was then deciphered with the help of interaction study. For this purpose, synphilin-1 (SNCAIP) was considered, as domain annotation of synphilin-1 revealed that it is 919 a.a (3745\u2009bp) protein encoded by 10 exons , encompassed six ankyrin like repeats and one central coiled-coil domain (510\u2013557) ( ). It has been corroborated from biochemical and NMR techniques that SNCAIP interacts with N-terminal region of SNCA . Although the normal cellular function of these interacting partners is still unknown but it has been reported that SNCAIP is developmentally localized to synaptic terminals and its association with synaptic vesicles is modulated by SNCA. In this context, SNCAIP is regarded as synaptic partner of SNCA, implying that this interaction mediates the synaptic functions of SNCA, possibly by anchoring SNCA to the vesicle membrane . \n\nIn order to explore the role of critical region in interaction, docking analysis was conducted. Interactions have been identified between sarcopterygian ancestral, mammalian specific and non- primate placental mammal\u2019s specific SNCA proteins, which revealed that interaction between SNCA and coiled-coil domain of SNCAIP has evolved with the passage of time i.e. lineage specific interactions have emerged during sarcopterygian evolutionary history ( ). Interaction analysis between human specific SNCA and coiled-coil domain of SNCAIP revealed that at the root of catarrhines, few lineage specific interactions have evolved i.e. Lys32, Tyr39, and Lys45 (see  , see  ). Interestingly these human (catarrhines) specific interactions reside in the identified critical region which strengthens our hypothesis of the structural and functional significance of this region and its vital role in FPD pathogenesis ( ). \n\nInteraction analysis between mutant models of human specific SNCA with SNCAIP revealed altered interaction patterns while some of the wild type interactions were retained too which signifies that SNCA and coiled-coil domain of SNCAIP not only interact in normal individuals but also in the FPD patients, however the pattern of interactions was found altered. Docked complexes of A30P-SNCAIP and E46K-SNCAIP revealed that the interactions shifted entirely to the NAC domain whereas H50Q-SNCAIP and G51D-SNCAIP complexes showed altered interactions involving N-terminal and NAC domains. Only interactions in A53T-SNCAIP were confined entirely to N-terminal domain but the pattern was found altered. It can be assumed that the interactions altered due to differential interaction pattern of SNCA and SNCAIP thus affecting their binding affinities which in turn influence SNCA aggregation ( , see  , see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAdvent of high throughput annotation of genes has enabled bioinformatics analysis of genes of interest to provide important insight into their evolutionary link with particular phenotypic trait and association with human disease . SNCA is deemed as one of the major causative genes in different neurodegenerative disorders. Five point mutations in SNCA have been reported so far, responsible for autosomal dominant Parkinson\u2019s disease. This novel study primarily highlights the sequence and structural mechanisms of SNCA protein evolution within sarcopterygian lineage, in particular for the first time, with the precise role of the lineage specific substitutions. \n\nThe ML and NJ gene phylogenies of synuclein family revealed that SNCA is a sarcopterygian specific gene and thus pinpoints its functional specificity to this class. The three putative paralogs of this family form the (SNCA,SNCB)(SNCG) topology indicating that SNCA and SNCB are closely related duplicate genes. Both of these paralogs share 63% identity which is also depicted in their cellular localization and function  ( , see  ). For instance, SNCA and SNCB are expressed predominately in brain, particularly enriched at presynaptic terminals performing membrane associated processes . SNCG share 53% sequence identity with SNCA . The divergent phylogenetic positioning of SNCG might account for differences in the functional aspects of this protein and its putative paralogous counter parts in vertebrates . Blast searches complemented by phylogenetic data confirm the absence of ortholog of this family in invertebrates. \n\nBranching pattern of the phylogenetic tree of synuclein family revealed that the two putative paralogs, SNCA and SNCB are evolving relatively at a slower rate as compared to SNCG. This finding led us to examine the molecular evolution of SNCA and its putative paralogous genes (SNCB and SNCG) specifically in sarcopterygian lineage. For this purpose the average K  (dN) and K  (dS) values were calculated within different phylogenetic groups of sarcopterygians. Estimation of statistical significance of difference between average K  and K  (z-test) within each phylogenetic groups of sarcopterygians have shown signature of strong negative selection on SNCA and its putative paralogous copies (SNCB & SNCG) (see  ) which corresponds to the structural and functional constrains on synuclein family. Particularly, the selective constraints on SNCA (being a major causative player in FPD) during sarcopterygians evolution is also depicted in highly conserved domain organization among its orthologous and paralogous proteins. Surveying domain topologies revealed highly preserved domain features: N-terminal A  alpha helix lipid binding domain, hydrophobic NAC domain and an acidic C-terminal domain. Explicitly, the N-terminus was identified as highly preserved among the analyzed orthologs and paralogs. This finding has directed this study to inspect the role of this region in defining the spatial constraints during the structural evolution of SNCA protein ( a,b). \n\nComparative structural analysis of human SNCA with its ancestral and mutant proteins and also with its paralogous proteins in human (SNCB and SNCG) revealed significant structural deviations encompassing region 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding domain of SNCA, despite of its high sequence conservation (  and  ,  , see   and  ). The destabilization of SNCA observed through structural evolution can be best explained by speculating that such intrinsic disordered proteins undergo transitions to more ordered states upon binding to their targets ( ). So it can be assumed that lineage specific substitutions (associated with putative conformational remodeling and functional diversification) occurred at the expense of protein stability. These substitutions which were confined to the C-terminal have actually regulated the structural dynamics of the identified N-terminal region (32\u201358) which is termed as   \u201ccritical region\u201d   of SNCA by the phenomena called as \u201c  epistasis  \u201d. The interaction study conducted between SNCA and coiled-coil domain of SNCAIP revealed that the critical region harbors crucial interaction sites which enlightened the vital role of this region in normal cellular as well as disease processes ( ). The functional significance of this identified region was further advocated by various evidences reported previously. Rasia   et al  . , stated an hypothesis that Cu(II) binding perturbs N-terminal long range interactions that are critical for stabilizing a soluble native like conformation of SNCA. Region 49\u201352 was reported as the strongest potential site for copper binding according to this study . Recently, it was reported that interface for dopamine mediated SNCA dimerisation encompassed region 43\u201360 of SNCA . These evidences strengthen our stated hypothesis that the critical region is not only performing its role in structural remodeling but also harbors crucial interaction sites for protein-protein or protein-metal interactions. It has been identified that SNCA mutants have a greater propensity to interact with and penetrate the lipid membrane through the domain from 36 to 45. This interaction causes an increase in SNCA oligomerization and toxicity which reinforces our assumption of the crucial role of this critical region in FPD pathogenesis . \n\nAlthough the normal cellular function and the metabolic pathways in which SNCA is involved are quite ambiguous, it has been reported that oxidative stress and proteasome inhibition are implicated in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders . Apoptosis can be caused by proteasome inhibition and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can cause DNA and protein damage leading to cell death . Various reports have shown that both proteasome inhibition and ROS can also trigger mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress cell death pathways . PD patients have been observed to show increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA, lipids and proteins . It has been accounted that oxidative stress increases SNCA aggregation. Oxidatively modified SNCA is more prone to aggregation than native protein. It has been identified that A53T mutant of SNCA causes increase in ER stress and elevate caspase-3, caspase-9 and caspase-12 activity . A53T also causes mitochondrial depolarization resulting in accumulation of cytochrome c in cytosol leading to cell death . Intriguingly, this human deleterious mutation (A53T) was discovered as a wild type in other sarcopterygian lineages analyzed i.e. non-hominoids, non-primate placental mammals, non-mammalian tetrapods ( ). These findings led us to hypothesize that the identified critical region plays a crucial mechanistic role in normal cellular functioning of SNCA. Furthermore, the reason behind observing \u201cparkinsonism\u201d only in humans can be attributed to human specific oxidative challenges and/or compensatory evolution in non-catarrhini sarcopterygians. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nKeeping in view the indispensable role of SNCA in the neurodegenerative processes, it is concluded that there are selective forces at work in sarcopterygians regulating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SNCA. If this is the case, then fine tuning of these mechanisms through subtle changes in protein activity might be one of the contributing factors in bringing vital evolutionary changes to match the different environmental and ecological needs. The result of present study provides evidence that during the course of evolution, the region encompassed 32 to 58 of N-terminal lipid binding domain has acquired its critical significance in normal cellular function of SNCA and disease pathogenesis. The epistatic influence of the lineage specific substitutions might have led to the structural remodeling and functional innovation of SNCA. i.e., any mutation in this critical region is deleterious. These findings pave the way to investigate further the vital role of identified critical region of SNCA in different interaction studies and also with drug discovery perspective to target this region for the treatment of FPD. \n\n\n## Additional Information \n  \n How to cite this article  : Siddiqui, I.

However, further research is warranted to prove its effectiveness. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVentral intermediate (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus is reputed to be \u2018invisible\u2019 on the routinely available imaging techniques. Currently, there exists several hypotheses related to the estimation of the Vim location [ ]. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify critical structures near the stereotactic targets is crucial. The optic tract, internal segment of the globus pallidus, border between the Vim nucleus of the thalamus and the internal capsule must be evaluated precisely before some serious surgeries [ ]. \n\nSeveral different surgical procedures have been proposed for the treatment of essential tremor, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), radiofrequency thalamotomy, gamma knife radio surgical thalamotomy and focused ultrasound thalamotomy [ ]. Stereotactic lesioning surgeries such as thalamotomy and pallidotomy have been performed to control movement disorders. The thalamic Vim nucleus is a usual target for controlling the tremor. Tremor-dominant hemi-Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a good indication of Vim thalamotomy, especially when tremor is a major complaint [ ]. Some techniques have been developed to define the Vim location. For instance, the Guiot\u2019s technique uses 3/12 or 4/12 anterior from posterior commissure (PC) in anterior commissure-PC (AC-PC) line [ ]. The coordinate base uses the brain atlas to define the Vim location [ ]. New techniques are hence required to develop variation of the brain anatomy. Improvement after Vim thalamotomy in the control of tremor ranges between 74% and 90% [ ]. VLT did not interfered by this variation. VLT can be used by neurosurgeons to determined the Vim location, including in different anatomical variation of the brain. Using VLT to determine Vim location should increase the outcome that can be measured by Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute efficacy superiority of DBS or thalamotomy for treating essential tremor [ ]. All of the procedures performed by the authors in this study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee. This work has been reported in line with the PROCESS guideline [ ]. This work has been registered at   (researchregistry6183). \n\n### Presentation of cases \n  \n#### Case 1 \n  \nA 30-year-old man presented with tremor in his right hand and a stiffness at his right side of the body. He was diagnosed with PD since the past 5 years and was receiving oral medication (L-dopa, trihexyphenidyl, pramipexole and ropinirole), but the tremor continued to recur. \n\nThe MRI and computerized tomography (CT) of the head is performed before conducting stereotactic surgery. The patient\u2019s UPDRS before surgery was ON 6 and OFF 33. The patient consented to undergo left Vim thalamotomy by the Vim line technique (VLT) using the   Cosman   G4 radiofrequency system (electrode active tip 4 mm, diameter 1.1 mm, 70 \u00b0C for 30 s) ( ). Evaluation after surgery revealed that tremor in the right hand and the stiffness of the right side of the body had improved. The patient\u2019s UPDRS score after surgery was ON 0 and OFF 7.   \nLeft side thalamotomy in the Vim line connecting the posterior tips of both the external globus pallidus in the AC-PC plane, 1.5-mm medial from the cerebrospinal tract border. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n#### Case 2 \n  \nA 59-year-old woman presented with a tremor at her left and right sides of the body. The left side tremor was dominant since past 15 years and the right side tremor since past 3 years. She also complained of rigidity and bradykinesia. Patient had ON-OFF response to oral medications (L-dopa, trihexyphenidyl, pramipexole and ropinirole). \n\nThe patient\u2019s head MRI and CT scan were performed before the stereotactic surgery. Her UPDRS score before the surgery was ON 15 and OFF 41. The patient consented to undergo the right Vim thalamotomy with VLT using the   Cosman   G4 radiofrequency system (electrode active tip 4 mm, diameter 1.1 mm, 70 \u00b0C for 30 s) ( ). Her evaluation after the surgery revealed that the tremor in the left side of the body had improved. Her UPDRS score after the surgery was ON 0 and OFF 7.   \nRight-side thalamotomy in the Vim line connecting the posterior tips of both the external globus pallidus in the AC-PC plane, 1.5-mm medial from the cerebrospinal tract border. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n#### Case 3 \n  \nA 57-year-old man presented with tremor in the left hand since the past 2 years. He had undergone left Vim thalamotomy 4 years ago for his right-side tremor. His head MRI and CT scan were performed before the stereotactic surgery. His UPDRS score before the surgery was ON 13 and OFF 42 with oral medications (L-dopa, trihexyphenidyl, pramipexole and ropinirole). He consented to undergo right Vim thalamotomy with VLT using the   Cosman   G4 radiofrequency system (electrode active tip 4 mm, diameter 1.1 mm, 70 \u00b0C for 30 s) ( ). His evaluation after the surgery revealed that the tremor in the left hand had improved. His UPDRS score after the surgery was ON 4 and OFF 23.   \nLeft-side thalamotomy in the Vim line connecting the posterior tips of both the external globus pallidus in the AC-PC plane, 1.5-mm medial from the cerebrospinal tract border. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThalamic stimulation and thalamotomy are equally effective in reducing drug resistant tremor, and stimulation has only a few adverse effects. The efficacy of stimulation ranges from 71% to 94% in PD patients and from 74% to 90% for essential tremor [ , ]. In patients with bilateral tremor, thalamic stimulation in the dominant hemisphere can be combined with thalamotomy for the non-dominant hemisphere; however, morbidity associated with thalamotomy probably outweighs any advantage of this approach [ ]. \n\nThe precise targeting of the Vim nucleus is crucial importance for the successful Vim thalamotomy. Targeting is usually conducted by using stereotactic coordinates that are specified in relation to a point on the AC-PC line based on the brain atlas or intraoperative stimulation techniques, although these methods sometimes need modification based on the anatomical brain variation. Since the identification of the thalamic nuclei on conventional imaging modalities is difficult, recently, MRI tractography was successfully used to investigate the dentatorubrothalamic tract that crosses the Vim nucleus [ ]. Some of the stereotactic planning software available presently do not have the tractography facility. \n\nVLT is a new technique that has been developed to determine the Vim location on MRI. This technique suitable for any brain anatomical variation. This technique is performed by drawing a line that connects both the external globus palidus posterior tips in the AC-PC plane. The Vim location is defined in 1.5-mm medial area from the cerebrospinal tract area border. Vim thalamotomy done with VLT using the   Cosman   G4 radiofrequency system (electrode active tip 4 mm, diameter 1.1 mm, 70 \u00b0C for 30 s). \n\nA past study has reported improvement in the UPDRS scores in the long-term evaluation after Vim thalamotomy [ ]. We noted symptom improvement in our cases as depicted by their UPDRS scores. Sixth months follow up of UPDRS were examined by same neurologist at the same hospital with constant score. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results depict that stereotactic thalamotomy using VLT can be used to determine the Vim location as a useful approach to reduce or control tremor in PD patients. However, further research is warranted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors report no declarations of interest. \n\n\n## Sources of funding \n  \nNone. \n\n\n## Ethical approval \n  \nThis research had ethical clearance from Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital Ethical Committee (No.1619/KEPK/XI/2019). \n\n\n## Consent \n  \nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

In this study we evaluated the clinical efficacy of using putaminal atrophy in brain MRI to differentiate MSA and PD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe measured the putamen/caudate volume ratio on brain MRI in 24 patients with MSA and 21 patients with PD. Two clinicians who were blinded to the patients' diagnoses and to each other's assessments measured the volume ratio using a computer program. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe measured volume ratios of the two investigators were highly correlated (  r  =0.72,   p  <0.0001). The volume ratio was significantly lower in MSA (1.29\u00b10.28) than PD (1.91\u00b10.29,   p  <0.0001). Setting an arbitrary cutoff ratio of 1.6 resulted in about 90% of patients with MSA falling into the group with a lower ratio, whereas more than 80% of patients with PD belonged to the other group. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe present results demonstrate that putaminal atrophy in MSA as measured on brain MRI represents an effective tool for differentiating MSA from PD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nClinical differentiation between idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and the striatonigral variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) is often difficult, particularly at the early stages. The main pathologic change observed in MSA-P is striatal degeneration in addition to the nigral cell loss seen in PD.  Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetry studies have shown that the striatal volume is lower in MSA-P than in PD. ,  However, the requirement to set a specific volume cutoff threshold is problematic due to the wide overlap between the two diseases (presumably resulting from the individual variation in absolute striatal size), which limits the diagnostic usefulness of MRI volumetry in routine clinical practice.  Interestingly, the pattern of striatal degeneration in MSA-P is characterized by predominant involvement of the putamen with relative sparing of the caudate nucleus;  this may result in a reduced the putamen/caudate volume ratio (PC ratio), which may be beneficial in reducing interindividual variability. Thus, we measured the PC ratio on routine brain MRI images to test its clinical value in early differentiation between MSA-P and PD. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \nThe study subjects comprised 24 consecutive patients with MSA-P (12 men and 12 women; age 65.5\u00b17.1 years, mean\u00b1SD) and 21 consecutive patients with PD (4 men and 17 women; age 65.2\u00b110.3 years), all of whom underwent brain MRI and had symptoms for 3 years or less. Clinical diagnoses of PD and MSA-P were based on the UK brain bank criteria  and MSA consensus criteria,  respectively. \n\nT2-weighted brain MRI (TR=4000 ms, TE=98 ms) was undertaken using a 1.5-T device (Signa Horizon Echo Speed, GE, Milwaukee, WI) with a standard quadrature head coil and a transaxial image slice thickness of 7 mm. Two neurologists (Drs. Kang and Yang) who were blinded to each other's assessments and the patients' diagnoses delineated the putamen and the caudate nucleus using a computer pen-based mouse on all the T2-weighted axial MRI images containing these structures using Scion Image\u00ae ( ). The volumes of these structures were calculated by multiplying the measured area by the number of slices containing them (i. e., measured area number of slices containing the structure 7 mm). For each patient, the mean ratio of both sides was used in the analyses. \n\nSimple regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the measurements of the two investigators, and to test the relationship between PC ratio and symptom duration or symptom severity. The unpaired   t  -test was employed to compare values between MSA-P and PD patients, with probability values of   p  <0.05 considered statistically significant. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nAge and symptom duration were comparable between the two groups: the age was 65.3\u00b110.3 and 65.5\u00b17.1 years, and the symptom duration was 20.0\u00b114.0 and 15.9\u00b110.4 months in PD and MSA-P, respectively. However, symptom severity based on Hoehn & Yahr stage was significantly higher in patients with MSA-P due to early development of postural instability (1.8\u00b10.64 in PD and 2.71\u00b10.57 in MSA-P). \n\nThe measured PC ratios of the two investigators were highly correlated (  r  =0.72,   p  <0.0001), although a certain amount of discordance was evident for individual patients ( ). The mean PC ratios of both investigators were significantly lower (  p  <0.0001) in MSA-P (1.29\u00b10.24) than in PD (1.91\u00b10.29). Setting an arbitrary cutoff ratio of 1.6 resulted in 91.7% and 87.5% patients with MSA (according to investigators 1 and 2, respectively) falling into the group with a lower ratio, while 81.0% and 85.7% of patients with PD (according to investigators 1 and 2, respectively) were in the other group ( ). PC ratios in the MSA-P group were not correlated with either symptom duration (  r  =0.13 and   p  =0.55) or symptom severity (i.e., Hoehn & Yahr stage) (  r  =0.25 and   p  =0.24). \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis study used routine MRI with a 7-mm slice thickness, and area measurements were performed manually. Thus, our absolute volume measurements may be less accurate than those in previous MRI volumetry studies that employed thinner slices. ,  However, since the same method was applied to measure both structures, we assume that the volume ratio itself is more reliable than measuring absolute volumes. The high correlation between the measurements of the two investigators supports this assumption. \n\nMRI volumetry studies have shown that both areas are degenerated in MSA-P, ,  but the reduced PC ratio confirmed previous pathological findings that the degree of degeneration is much more severe in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus.  Since the striatum is not affected in PD, ,  the PC ratio is presumably similar in PD patients and healthy subjects. The relative ease of performing routine MRI-based PC ratio measurements in clinical practice may represent an advantage over MRI volumetry ,  and other MRI-based methods aimed at discriminating between MSA-P and PD. ,  An arbitrary cutoff of 1.6 differentiated more than 80% of the patients included in this study. Considering the interinvestigator variability, this value may not be applicable in other experimental settings, but it appears to provide useful information for early differentiation of MSA-P and PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2686861, "text_md5": "4801389c47dc59bf93d12658f0cece15", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 102], "journal": [103, 116], "publication_year": [118, 122], "title": [133, 276], "keywords": [290, 352], "abstract": [365, 1602], "body": [1611, 6956]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 19513295, "doi": "10.3988/jcn.2007.3.2.79", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686861", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2686861"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686861\">2686861</a>", "list_title": "PMC2686861  Use of the Putamen/Caudate Volume Ratio for Early Differentiation between Parkinsonian Variant of Multiple System Atrophy and Parkinson Disease"}

Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age\u2010related, diagnostic, and severity\u2010associated PD biomarker. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nComprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS\u2010III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn Cohort A,   N  8\u2010acetylspermidine and   N  \u2010acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore,   N  1,  N  8\u2010diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&Y, UPDRS\u2010III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH\u2010SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls. \n\n\n## Interpretation \n  \nSpermine synthesis and   N  1,  N  8\u2010diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity\u2010associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:251\u2013263 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nAging is the major risk factor for many chronic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease (PD), whose current treatment is limited to symptomatic relief. ,  ,   Because PD prevalence increases with age, the number of PD patients is estimated to double from 6.9 million in 2015 to 14.2 million in 2040.  Although age\u2010related molecular mechanisms of PD (eg, dopamine metabolism, iron accumulation, mitochondrial DNA changes, and decreased protein\u2010degradation efficiency) have been proposed,  no corresponding blood biomarkers have been validated for widespread clinical use. Blood\u2010based biomarkers associated with aging\u2010related risk for PD would enable efficient monitoring of the disease process and could be used for development of therapies. \n\nPolyamines are ubiquitous small polycations that ionically bind to various negatively charged molecules and have many functions, mostly linked to cell growth, survival, and proliferation.  Prime examples of polyamines are putrescine, spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm), whose levels are strictly controlled. Putrescine is sequentially converted into Spd and Spm by S\u2010adenosyl\u2010L\u2010methionine decarboxylase and Spd/Spm synthase. Consecutively, Spd is converted to Spm by Spm synthase, and vice versa by Spm oxidase (Fig  ).   N  1\u2010acetylspermine (  N  1\u2010AcSpm) and   N  1\u2010acetylspermidine (  N  1\u2010AcSpd) are synthesized by the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl\u2010coenzyme A to the   N  1\u2010position of either Spd or Spm, respectively, which is catalyzed by Spd/Spm acetyltransferase 1 or 2 (SAT1/2). In addition,   N  8\u2010acetylspermidine (  N  8\u2010AcSpd),   N  1,  N  8\u2010diacetylspermidine (DiAcSpd), and   N  1,  N  12\u2010diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) are produced by acetylation of Spd,   N  1\u2010AcSpd,   N  8\u2010AcSpd, and   N  1\u2010AcSpm, respectively. \n  \nPolyamine metabolism in humans.

Ac\u2010CoA = acetyl\u2010coenzyme A; APAO =   N  1\u2010acetylpolyamine oxidase; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; CoA = coenzyme A; MTA = 5\u2032\u2010deoxy\u20105\u2032\u2010methylthioadenosine; SAMHC = S\u2010adenosylmethyl homocysteamine; SAT1/2 = spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase 1/2. \n  \nSpd and Spm have been shown to increase the lifespan of different species and improve neural functions via enhancement of autophagy in   Caenorhabditis elegans  , Drosophila, and mice. ,   Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway associated with the pathogenesis of aging\u2010related neurodegeneration as it loses efficiency in aging organisms. ,  \n\nHuman whole blood concentrations of Spd and Spm are kept strictly within the 4 to 40\u03bcM range. ,  ,   Levels of Spd and Spm are lower in 60\u2010 to 80\u2010year\u2010olds than in 31\u2010 to 56\u2010year\u2010olds.  In the rat cerebral cortex and human basal ganglia, the levels of Spd and Spm decrease with age.  Although it is not fully understood how brain polyamine levels are associated with levels in peripheral blood, levels in both the brain and blood decrease with age. In PD patients, levels of putrescine and   N  1\u2010AcSpd significantly increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas concentration of Spd is reduced.  In addition, serum   N  8\u2010AcSpd levels are increased in PD patients with a malignant phenotype.  Based on partial polyamine data in PD using a previously reported cohort,  we investigated polyamine metabolic changes in a novel PD cohort by comparing tauopathies, specifically, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer disease (AD) as disease controls. \n\n## Subjects and Methods \n  \n###  Ethics Statement  \n  \nThis study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Juntendo University (#2012157). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. \n\n\n###  Participants  \n  \nAll participants were recruited at the Juntendo University Hospital and examined by board\u2010certified neurologists. Cohort A (previously reported as \u201c2nd cohort\u201d in our report ) and Cohort B were independently recruited from December 2014 to February 2015 and from December 2016 to January 2017, respectively. PD, PSP, and AD were diagnosed according to the well\u2010established criteria for each disease. ,  ,   We excluded PD patients with possible dementia (Mini\u2010Mental State Examination score\u2009<\u200924) to avoid substantial overlap between PD with possible dementia and AD. Neither patients nor controls had a history of tumors, cancer, aspiration pneumonia, or inflammatory diseases including collagen vascular diseases. Participants suffering from acute infectious diseases or acute/chronic renal or hepatic failure at the time of sample collection were also excluded. Disease duration means the time since initial motor symptoms of PD. Hoehn and Yahr stages (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS\u2010III) scores were defined during the \u201con phase\u201d for practical and ethical reasons. UPDRS\u2010III score in Cohort B may be at a lower level because of the preserved general physical status without any critical illness. L\u2010dopa equivalent dose (LED) was calculated based on a previous report. \n\n\n###  Sample Collection  \n  \nSample collection was performed from December 2014 to February 2015 and from December 2016 to January 2017 for Cohorts A and B, respectively. Plasma and serum were extracted as described previously.  Each 500\u03bcl of plasma or serum aliquot was stored in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer until use. Sample preparation followed by immediate mass spectrometry analysis of Cohorts A and B were performed in February 2015 and April 2017, respectively. \n\n\n###  Sample Preparation  \n  \nPolyamine metabolites were extracted as described previously.  Briefly, 200\u03bcl of serum was immediately added to 200\u03bcl of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10pmol of   N  1\u2010AcSpd\u2013d  (Toronto Research Chemical, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) as an internal standard. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the upper aqueous layer was collected. The sample was dissolved in 50\u03bcl of Milli\u2010Q water after lyophilizing, and 10\u03bcl was used for liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS). The concentration of each compound was estimated by its peak area of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) relative to that of the internal standard (  N  1\u2010AcSpd\u2010d ). \n\n\n###  Metabolome Analysis  \n  \n####  Capillary Electrophoresis Time\u2010of\u2010Flight MS and LC Time\u2010of\u2010Flight MS  \n  \nUsing capillary electrophoresis time\u2010of\u2010flight MS and LC time\u2010of\u2010flight MS with Advanced Scan Plus (Human Metabolome Technologies, Yamagata, Japan), comprehensive metabolome analysis was conducted based on methods described previously. \n\n\n####  LC\u2010MS of Detailed Polyamine Metabolites  \n  \nSpd, Spm, and their acetylated metabolites were separated by high\u2010performance LC (HPLC; Gilson, Middleton, WI) using a Develosil ODS UG3 column (150\u2009\u00d7\u20092.0mm, 3\u03bcm particle; Nomura Chemical Co, Aichi, Japan). LC conditions were modified from a method reported previously.  Briefly, we used 0.1% HCOOH/0.05% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA)/H O as mobile phase A and 0.1% HCOOH/0.05% HFBA/80% acetonitrile as mobile phase B, with a flow rate of 150\u03bcl/min. The HPLC system was connected to a TSQ Quantum Ultra AM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Target compounds were analyzed in the SRM positive\u2010ionization mode. \n\n\n\n###  Diffusion Tensor Imaging  \n  \nDiffusion tensor images were acquired from 20 PD patients successively examined (3.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.822 months after blood sampling) within Cohort B on a 3.0T system (Achieva; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) with an 8\u2010channel phased\u2010array head coil for sensitivity encoding parallel imaging. Whole brain images were obtained using spin\u2010echo echo planar imaging (EPI) with (1) 32 uniformly distributed direction diffusion\u2010encoding (b = 1,000 s/mm  for each direction), and (2) no diffusion weighting (b = 0 s/mm ) in an anterior\u2013posterior phase\u2010encoding direction. Standard\u2010 and reverse\u2010phase encoded blipped images with no diffusion weighting were also acquired to correct for magnetic susceptibility\u2010induced distortions related to EPI acquisitions.  The scanning parameters were repetition time = 9,810 milliseconds, echo time = 100 milliseconds, field of view = 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256mm, matrix size = 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128, slice thickness = 2mm, number of slices = 75, orientation = axial, and scanning time = 6.50 minutes. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets were checked visually in all 3 orthogonal views. No dataset had severe artifacts related to gross geometric distortions, bulk motion, or signal dropout. Data were corrected for susceptibility\u2010induced geometric distortions, eddy current distortions, and intervolume subject motion using the EDDY and TOPUP toolboxes.  Tensors were computed at each voxel by fitting a tensor model to diffusion\u2010weighted images with b = 0 and 1,000 s/mm . Once the tensor was estimated, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were estimated based on standard formulae. \n\n\n###  DTI Image Processing Using Tract\u2010Based Spatial Statistics Analysis  \n  \nWhole\u2010brain voxelwise analysis of all diffusion tensor\u2013derived measurements was performed using tract\u2010based spatial statistics (TBSS) implemented with FMRIB Software Library 5.0.9 (FSL, Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK;  ).  Briefly, FA images of all subjects were registered into FMRIB58_FA standard\u2010space images with the nonlinear registration tool FNIRT, followed by visual inspection to ensure registration quality. Then, mean FA images were created by averaging registered FA images. Furthermore, mean FA images were thinned to generate a mean FA skeleton representing the centers of all tracts of groups. Aligned FA images from each subject were projected onto the mean FA skeleton using a lower threshold of FA = 0.2 to exclude peripheral tracts and gray matter. By applying the original nonlinear registration warping field of each subject's FA to the standard space, MD, AD, and RD were also projected onto the mean FA skeleton. Furthermore, MD, AD, and RD data were also used to calculate voxelwise statistics. Anatomical locations of regions with significant correlations in the white\u2010matter skeleton were identified by the Johns Hopkins University DTI white matter atlas within FSL.  In addition, average diffusion metrics of clusters that showed significant correlation by TBSS analysis were measured. \n\n\n###  Genomic DNA Analysis  \n  \nDNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a Qiagen Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). To rule out the possibility that Spd and/or Spm metabolism is changed by SAT2 or histone deacetylase 10 (HDAC10), ,   genetic screening of   SAT1  ,   SAT2  , and   HDAC10   were performed. Eighteen single\u2010nucleotide variants (SNVs) present in >1% of the Japanese population were chosen based on the Integrative Japanese Genome Variation Database (iJGVD). Of these, 16 SNVs (rs13894, rs858521, rs858520, and rs139435483 of the   SAT2   gene; rs75596977, rs5771271, rs76578729, rs77096954, rs4838866, rs35820251, rs41283469, rs738334, rs1555048, rs150016700, rs77003572, and rs76662439 of the   HDAC10   gene) were examined using the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real\u2010Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with TaqMan genotyping assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final volume was 10\u03bcl, consisting of 5\u03bcl TaqMan GTXpress Master Mix, 0.5\u03bcl TaqMan genotyping assay, 2.5\u03bcl nuclease\u2010free water, and 2\u03bcl genomic DNA in each well of a 96\u2010well plate. Real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps included an initial enzyme activation step at 95\u00b0C for 20 seconds, followed by 40 cycles of a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 1 second and an annealing/extension step at 60\u00b0C for 3 seconds. The other SNVs (rs11553697 and rs2294404 of the   HDAC10   gene ) and all cording exons and exon\u2010intron boundaries of   SAT1  , spermine synthase (  SMS  ), and spermine oxidase (  SMOX  ) genes were sequenced using the Sanger method with BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA) PCR, and sequencing primers were designed by Primer 3. Frequencies of analyzed SNVs were referred to gnomAD ( ) and compared with iJGVD for the Japanese population ( ). Pathogenicity of identified missense variants was determined using the sorting\u2010intolerant\u2010from\u2010tolerant method.  Frequencies of each variant were evaluated using the Exome Aggregation Consortium database ( ). \n\n\n###  Materials  \n  \nSpd, Spm,   N  1\u2010AcSpd,   N  8\u2010AcSpd, putrescine, and bafilomycin A1 were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St Louis, MO).   N  1\u2010AcSpm, DiAcSpm, and DiAcSpd were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). \n\n\n###  Cell Culture  \n  \nHuman neuroblastoma SH\u2010SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), MEM Non\u2010Essential Amino Acids Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1mM sodium pyruvate, and 2mM L\u2010glutamine, at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO  and 95% atmospheric air. Human adenocarcinoma HeLa cells, human colon cancer LoVo cells, human hepatocyte carcinoma HepG2 cells, and human embryo kidney HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in HuMedia\u2010EG2 (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan), and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A (Modified) Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. \n\n\n###  Western Blotting  \n  \nWestern blot analysis was performed as previously described,  with slight modifications. Cells were lysed in buffer (25mM Tris\u2010HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP\u201040, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], and protease inhibitor cocktail) for 15 minutes on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes to yield soluble cell lysates. For immunoblotting, 20\u03bcg of cell lysate proteins were subjected to 10 to 20% gradient SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and probed with specific antibodies. This was followed by detection using West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the LAS\u20104000 Mini (GE Healthcare UK, Little Chalfont, UK). The primary antibodies used were anti\u2013microtubule\u2010associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti\u2013\u03b2\u2010actin (EMD Millipore Co, Billerica, MA). \n\n\n###  Statistical Analysis  \n  \nWhen a value was below the limit of detection, it was assigned half the minimum value of its compound. Wilcoxon tests were used to compare all individual analyses between controls and PD patients. Steel test is a nonparametric, multiple\u2010comparison test, and was used to compare patients stratified by H&Y (I, II, III, and IV) and controls, or by PD, de novo PD, PSP, or AD and controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using JMP13 (SAS Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Optimal cutoff values and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using Youden index maxima (sensitivity + specificity \u2212 1).  Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine relationships between serum metabolite levels and LED or UPDRS\u2010III in PD using JMP13. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for allelic and genotypic correlations with PD risk. Allele frequencies were analyzed with Pearson chi\u2010squared test. Probability of   p   <\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\nThe Randomize tool ( ) was used to examine relationships between diffusion metrics and blood metabolites (DiAcSpd,   N  8\u2010AcSpd, DiAcSpm, and Spm/Spd ratio) by multiple linear regression analysis. A general linear model was created for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with age and LED as nuisance covariates to adjust for their potential confounding influence on DTI measurements. To avoid selection of an arbitrary cluster\u2010forming threshold, the threshold free cluster enhancement option was used in Randomize. In total, 5,000 permutations were generated to provide an empirical null distribution of maximal cluster size.  For free water elimination,   p   <\u20090.05 was considered significant for TBSS. In addition, mean diffusion tensor\u2013derived measurements of significant clusters were correlated with blood metabolites using Spearman rank correlation test, with significance defined at   p   <\u20090.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n###  Two Acetylation Forms,   N  8\u2010AcSpd and   N  \u2010Acetylputrescine, Correlated with PD Severity in Cohort A  \n  \nComprehensive metabolome analysis using Cohort A (named \u201c2nd cohort\u201d in our previous report ) showed elevated   N  8\u2010AcSpd (ratio of PD to control = 1.44,   p   =\u20090.0036) and   N  \u2010acetylputrescine (  N  \u2010AcPut; ratio of PD to control = 1.20,   p   =\u20090.126) in PD relative to healthy controls. Levels of the other polyamine metabolites were below the detection limit.  Both   N  8\u2010AcSpd and   N  \u2010AcPut positively correlated with H&Y (  N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   <\u20090.0001;   N  \u2010AcPut,   p   =\u20090.0002), UPDRS\u2010III (  N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   <\u20090.0001;   N  \u2010AcPut,   p   =\u20090.0002), age at sampling (hereafter simply referred to as \u201cage\u201d;   N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0007;   N  \u2010AcPut,   p   <\u20090.0001), and LED (  N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0018;   N  \u2010AcPut,   p   <\u20090.0001). Age and LED strongly correlated with H&Y (age,   p   =\u20090.0053; LED,   p   <\u20090.0001). Thus, to exclude interactions of LED or age with both acetylated polyamines, we performed multiple regression analyses and found that   N  8\u2010AcSpd significantly correlated with H&Y (LED,   p   <\u20090.0001) and mildly with UPDRS\u2010III (LED,   p   =\u20090.0517). Meanwhile,   N  \u2010AcPut mildly correlated with H&Y (LED,   p   =\u20090.0667) and UPDRS\u2010III (LED,   p   =\u20090.0932). However,   N  8\u2010AcSpd and   N  \u2010AcPut significantly correlated with H&Y (age,   p   <\u20090.0001 and   p   =\u20090.0036, respectively) and UPDRS\u2010III (age,   p   =\u20090.0004 and   p   =\u20090.0042, respectively). \n\n\n###  DiAcSpd Correlates with Severity of PD  \n  \nFurther exploration of polyamine metabolic changes in PD incorporated a larger validation cohort (Cohort B), including tauopathy disease controls (PSP and AD; Table  , Cohort B). In Cohort B, we performed serum analysis, as it enabled us to perform more sensitive analysis of Spm and Spd with similar sensitivity to their acetylated forms compared with plasma analysis (data not shown). As expected, most acetylated polyamine forms were significantly elevated in PD (Table  ). Importantly, Spd was significantly higher in PD than controls, whereas Spm was significantly lower in PD. A similar tendency in levels of each polyamine metabolite was also detected in 4 de novo PD patients. \n  \nDemographic Characteristics of Participants in Both Cohorts \n      \nPolyamine Metabolites in Cohort B Patients \n    \nAs shown in Figure  A\u2013G, DiAcSpd,   N  8\u2010AcSpd, and DiAcSpm positively correlated with H&Y, UPDRS\u2010III (DiAcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0023;   N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0046; DiAcSpm,   p   =\u20090.0103), and LED (DiAcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0043;   N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0029; DiAcSpm,   p   =\u20090.00223). ROC curve analysis with these 7 metabolites showed a high diagnostic value (see Fig  H) similar to DiAcSpd (AUC = 0.946, cutoff value = 0.821). Furthermore, these polyamine metabolites had robust diagnostic power for differentiating PD from PSP (AUC = 0.931, cutoff value = 0.805) and AD (AUC = 0.938, cutoff value = 0.801). As in Cohort A, age, disease duration and LED positively correlated with H&Y stage (age,   p   <\u20090.0001; disease duration,   p   <\u20090.0001; LED,   p   <\u20090.0001); therefore, logistic regression and multiple regression analyses were performed to exclude their influence for accurate assessment of the relationship between acetylated polyamines and disease severity. Positive correlations of disease severity with DiAcSpd were detected under normalization of both LED (Table  ) and age (Table  ). Likewise, ANCOVA showed that the levels of 3 acetylated polyamines were significantly elevated in association with age in PD relative to controls (DiAcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0056;   N  8\u2010AcSpd,   p   =\u20090.0468; DiAcSpm,   p   =\u20090.0018), which was partially consistent with a previous report. \n  \nAcetylated spermidine (Spd)/spermine (Spm) positively correlates with Parkinson disease severity. (A\u2013F) Levels of   N  1,  N  8\u2010diacetylspermidine (DiAcSpd),   N  8\u2010acetylspermidine (  N  8\u2010AcSpd), and   N  1,  N  12\u2010diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) positively correlated with Parkinson disease severity assessed by Hoehn and Yahr stages (H&Y), whereas other polyamine metabolites did not. Values indicate the amount of each metabolite (pmol) in 200\u03bcl serum. (G) Levels of Spm were significantly decreased in Parkinson disease, at H&Y stages I and IV. Values indicate the amount of each metabolite (pmol) in 200\u03bcl serum. (H) Receiver operating characteristic curves for all serum polyamine metabolites and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) statistics for the true positive rate of Parkinson disease diagnosis in Cohort B. (I) Scatterplots showing positive relationships between DiAcSpd and fractional anisotropy (FA) in Parkinson disease. (J) Significant positive correlation between   N  1,  N  8\u2010diacetylspermidine and FA, adjusted for age and L\u2010dopa equivalent dose (  p   <\u20090.05, familywise error corrected) in Parkinson disease patients. Significant clusters were overlaid onto a Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) ICBM152 standard brain T1\u2010weighted image. Slices in MNI coordinates x, y, z are shown in millimeters. Colored bar represents   p   value. **  p   <\u20090.01, ***  p   <\u20090.001 (Steel test or analysis of variance).   N  1\u2010AcSpd =   N  1\u2010acetylspermidine;   N  1\u2010AcSpm:   N  1\u2010acetylspermine; NS = not significant. \n    \nCorrelation Analysis with Logistic Regression or Multiple Regression Model of Each Polyamine Metabolite, Disease Severity (H&Y or UPDRS\u2010III), and LED \n      \nCorrelation Analysis with Logistic Regression or Multiple Regression Model of Each Polyamine Metabolite, Disease Severity (H&Y or UPDRS\u2010III), and Age at Sampling \n    \nTo confirm that these polyamine metabolites reflect disease severity of PD, we performed DTI on 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B. As shown in Table  , no significant differences were observed for any clinical characteristics and polyamine metabolite levels between PD patients and PD patients with DTI. Using DTI, we investigated association between levels of the 3 acetylated polyamines and axonal changes detected in PD.  Accordingly, TBSS analysis detected a significant positive correlation between DiAcSpd and FA in an extensive white matter area in the brain of PD patients after normalization of LED and age (see Fig  I, J;   p   <\u20090.05, familywise error\u2010corrected; Peak Montreal Neurological Institute method x, y, z: 77, 90, 110; t  =\u20097.06; r  =\u20090.70; voxels = 45,836).  Spearman rank correlation test also revealed that mean FA values for significant clusters in PD patients correlated positively with DiAcSpd (  r   =\u20090.63,   p   =\u20090.003). \n  \nPatients\u2019 Characteristics of PD with or without Diffusion Tensor Imaging \n    \n\n###  Analysis of Polyamine Metabolism\u2010Associated Genes  \n  \nNext, we genotyped 19 SNVs to investigate whether variants of 3 genes (  SAT1  ,   SAT2  , and   HDAC10  ) that encode enzymes associated with synthesis or acetylation/deacetylation of Spd and Spm affect polyamine metabolism in patients with PD. In addition, Sanger sequencing for mutation detection in the   SAT1  ,   SMS  , and   SMOX   genes was performed. We did not detect any variants with statistically different frequencies between patients with PD and controls ( ). \n\n\n###  Spm/Spd Ratio Is Consistently Suppressed in PD Independent of Age  \n  \nThe Spm/Spd ratio, indicating Spm conversion from Spd, significantly decreased in the PD group compared with the healthy control group, as a whole (ratio to control = 0.459) and in each of the H&Y stages as assessed by Steel test (ratio to control: I = 0.451, II = 0.470, III = 0.466, IV = 0.447; Fig  ). The Spm/Spd ratio enabled us to distinguish patients with PD from healthy controls. However, more distinct classification was provided using both Spm/Spd ratio and DiAcSpd. Interestingly, PD patients showed significantly lower Spm/Spd ratios at any age (  p   =\u20090.0007), whereas healthy controls showed higher ratios especially from 40 to 60 years old. This negative correlation with age is compatible with reports showing age\u2010dependent decreases in Spm levels.  Altogether, these data suggest that decreased Spm effects with aging might be associated with onset risk of PD. \n  \nConversion of spermidine (Spd) to spermine (Spm) is suppressed in Parkinson disease (PD), without association with disease severity. (A) Spm/Spd ratio was significantly decreased in PD patients. ***  p   <\u20090.001 (Wilcoxon test).

Thus, we investigated Spm effects on various cell lines using the LC3\u2010II/\u03b2\u2010actin ratio. Spm upregulated the LC3\u2010II/\u03b2\u2010actin ratio drastically in human neuroblastoma SH\u2010SY5Y cells, and moderately in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (Fig  A). Next, the effects of 3 polyamines and 5 acetylated forms on autophagy in SH\u2010SY5Y cells were examined. Of these 8 molecules, Spm,   N  1\u2010AcSpm, and Spd significantly upregulated LC3\u2010II levels (Fig  B). Quantitative analysis of LC3\u2010II levels in 3 independent samples showed that Spm upregulated at 5\u03bcM, whereas   N  1\u2010AcSpm and Spd modulated at 25\u03bcM (Fig  C). \n  \nSpecific polyamines induced autophagy in SH\u2010SY5Y cells. (A) Cells were treated with 50\u03bcM spermine (Spm) for 4 hours. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti\u2010LC3 and \u03b2\u2010actin antibodies, and then signal intensities of LC3\u2010II/\u03b2\u2010actin level in Spm\u2010treated cells (normalized to control cells) were quantified using ImageJ software ( ). Results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) of 3 samples. (B) SH\u2010SY5Y cells were treated with the indicated chemicals for 4 hours. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti\u2010LC3 and \u03b2\u2010actin antibodies. (C) SH\u2010SY5Y cells were treated with spermidine (Spd),   N  1\u2010acetylspermine (  N  1\u2010AcSpm), and Spm at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100\u03bcM for 4 hours. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti\u2010LC3 and \u03b2\u2010actin antibodies, and then signal intensities of LC3\u2010II (normalized to \u03b2\u2010actin) were quantified using ImageJ software. Results are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of 3 samples. (D, E) SH\u2010SY5Y cells were treated with 50\u03bcM Spm or Spd, with or without lysosomal inhibitors (D, 100nM bafilomycin A1; E, E64D plus pepstatin A) for 4 hours. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti\u2010LC3 and \u03b2\u2010actin antibodies. DiAcSpd =   N  1,  N  8\u2010acetylspermidine; DiAcSpm =   N  1,  N  12\u2010acetylspermine;   N  1\u2010AcSpd =   N  1\u2010acetylspermidine;   N  1\u2010AcSpm =   N  1\u2010acetylspermine;   N  8\u2010AcSpd =   N  8\u2010acetylspermidine; Put = putrescine. \n  \nLC3\u2010II upregulation is induced by autophagosome formation or impairment of autophagosome maturation. In the presence of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification and of autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion, Spm and Spd increased LC3\u2010II levels compared with controls (see Fig  D). Similar results were obtained when cells were cotreated with the lysosomal protease inhibitors pepstatin A and E64D (see Fig  E), indicating that Spm and Spd induce autophagy, and that Spm is a more potent autophagy inducer. These data imply that decreased levels of Spm/Spd may affect autophagic activity in PD patients. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the current study, we identified DiAcSpd as a diagnostic, severity\u2010associated, medication\u2010independent biomarker of PD, although gender distribution differences between controls and PD may affect polyamine metabolism. Notably, even using a multivariate model, DiAcSpd remained significantly correlated with disease severity. In addition, decreases in Spm and the Spm/Spd ratio were detected in PD and AD, but not control or PSP groups. In particular, the Spm/Spd ratio was consistently decreased across ages in PD, unlike the ratio in controls, which showed gradual decrements, suggesting a PD\u2010associated aging tendency. Levels of Spd were only mildly increased in de novo PD and under medication\u2010normalized conditions. Finally, we confirmed that among the polyamine metabolites tested, Spm enhanced autophagy most intensely in SH\u2010SY5Y cells, which were used as a neuronal model for PD and AD, implying a decrement in autophagic activity in PD and AD. \n\nWe and others have reported serum/plasma metabolite biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD. However, surrogate biomarkers reflecting age\u2010related pathogeneses have not been established. ,  ,  ,   DiAcSpd levels clearly correlated with both H&Y and UPDRS\u2010III under age\u2010 or medication\u2010normalized conditions, and significantly correlated with FA (an index of white matter integrity alterations), in diffuse white matter, similar to our previous report. ,   Likewise, higher diagnostic power of DiAcSpd levels was confirmed. Taken together, serum DiAcSpd measurements could be a potential diagnostic biomarker correlating with disease severity. \n\nSeveral lines of evidences have shown changes in CSF polyamine levels in patients with various diseases including brain tumors, inflammation, and neurodegeneration.  In PD compared with controls, Spd decreases in CSF, whereas putrescine increases in CSF and decreases in red blood cells, and no significant changes in Spd and Spm in the basal ganglia have been reported. ,  ,   Concentrations of Spd and Spm in the basal ganglia gradually decrease in normal aging.  Experimentally, Spm clearance from the brain parenchyma mainly occurs via the blood\u2013CSF (BCSFB) rather than the blood\u2013brain barrier.  Taken together, decreased serum Spm detected in PD in the current study may indicate that brain Spm decreases via the BCSFB. \n\nCompared with PD, YKL\u201040 levels in CSF are increased in PSP, which is often difficult to diagnose accurately, particularly in the early stages.  No serum/plasma differential biomarkers have been established. In the current study, serum polyamine metabolite profile appears to be a potential diagnostic tool for differentiating PD from PSP and AD. Moreover, aging is the most important causative risk factor for PD, PSP, and AD.  Mean age at onset of neurological symptoms of PSP is 66.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912 years, similar to PD, but disease prevalence of PSP does not correlate with aging. ,   This is consistent with our finding that Spm and the Spm/Spd ratio are suppressed in PD and AD, but that the ratio in PSP is not significantly different from controls. \n\nAutophagy deficiency causes neurodegeneration along with aggregated protein accumulation in the cytoplasm. ,   Notably, in PD, \u03b1\u2010synuclein included in Lewy bodies is an autophagy substrate and targeted by disease\u2010modifying therapy with autophagy\u2010inducing chemicals.  In addition, \u03b1\u2010synuclein itself inhibits autophagic flux in cellular models.  Growing evidence implies that Spd is involved in antiaging through induction of autophagy.  Furthermore, oral Spd administration protects flies against neurodegenerationlike age\u2010induced memory impairment and \u03b1\u2010synuclein\u2013induced motor dysfunction through autophagy enhancement, indicating that Spd\u2010induced autophagy is indispensable for lifespan\u2010extension/neuroprotection.  Antiaging effects of Spm have also been reported in mice.  Because our data showed that Spm was 3 to 4 times more effective in autophagy induction than Spd at 5 to 20\u03bcM, which is within physiological blood concentrations, and considering decreased levels of Spm and Spm/Spd ratios in PD and AD, conversion from Spd to Spm may be crucial for the maintenance of homeostasis in neuronal cell lines. \n\nThis study has some limitations. First, it was conducted at a single university hospital. Second, not all enrolled patients underwent DTI scans. Finally, medications or cancers may affect polyamine metabolism. Although antiparkinsonian medications may influence polyamine metabolism, which concomitantly occurs in various tissues, the hyperacetylation status was confirmed under normalized condition of antiparkinsonian medications in our cohorts. Polyamine metabolism is upregulated in patients with urogenital or colorectal cancers; thus, we excluded patients with any known cancer in both cohorts.  Future studies should test all polyamine\u2010associated metabolites, including ornithine and putrescine, in larger cohorts. In addition, longitudinal observation in the same cases should be included in future research. \n\nHerein, DiAcSpd is shown to be a potential, peripheral, noninvasive, diagnostic biomarker of PD that correlates with disease severity. In addition, we demonstrate that dysfunction in conversion from Spd to Spm is an age\u2010related risk for PD. Our study provides new insight into the association between aging risk for PD and autophagic activity regulated by Spm synthesis from Spd. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nStudy concept and design: S.Sa., Y.S., N.H.

However, research on Parkinson disease (PD) treatment with APS is lacking. \n\n\n## Material/Methods \n  \nThe present study was designed to explore the effects of APS on the protection of neurons and mitochondrial in a mouse model of PD using behavioral experiments, and observations of mitochondrial structure and transmembrane potential. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIt was shown that APS could attenuate 1-methyl-4-pheyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunction (  P  <0.01), increase the proportion of TH-positive cells (  P  <0.01), reverse MPTP-induced mitochondrial structural damage, and reduce MPTP-induced high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase MPTP-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, APS also decreased the bax/bcl2 ratio, and cytochrome-c and caspase-3 protein content (  P  <0.01) in substantia nigra in our mouse PD model. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAPS provided a protective effect on neurons and mitochondrial in a mouse PD model. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a central nervous system degenerative disease that mainly occurs in middle-aged and elderly people. It effects multiple neurons in the early stage, with central nervous system damage as the main clinical manifestation in the late or advanced stage [ , ]. The formation of residual markers of dopaminergic neurons in the cytoplasm and the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the densities of midbrain substantia nigra are characterized by PD typical pathologic changes [ , ]. Although the pathogenesis of PD is not clear, many studies [ \u2013 ] have shown that mitochondrial damage plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxygenated stress damage are the main pathological mechanisms of nervous system degenerative diseases. Mitochondria, as organelles that are abundantly distributed in neuronal cells, have long been considered \u201cenergy metabolism plants\u201d that supports nerve cell function through oxidative phosphorylation [ , ]. In addition to participating in energy metabolism in cells, it also plays an important physiological and pathological mediating role in the regulation of cell calcium homeostasis [ ], free radical dynamic balance [ ], apoptosis [ ], etc. [ ]. \n\nRecently, more and more scholars have begun to study the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine and its monomer treatment of PD. These mechanisms are mainly involved in protecting dopaminergic neurons [ ], improving mitochondrial function [ ], reducing neuritis [ ], enhancing immune response [ ], reducing excitotoxicity [ ], anti-apoptosis [ ], inducing autophagy [ ], and inhibiting the accumulation of abnormal proteins [ ]. For example, geniposide enhances the growth factor signal and reduces apoptosis in a neuroprotective effect. Paeoniflorin may protect neurons by enhancing mitochondrial function. \n\n Astragalus polysaccharide   (APS) is one of the main active ingredients in astragalus. It has been reported to have many pharmacological activities [ \u2013 ], such as immunity enhancement, anti-tumor, hypoglycemic, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and antiviral activities, and has a wide range of clinical applications. At present, the research and clinical application of APS has mostly focused on the regulation of immune function. The treatments available for nerve-related diseases are few, and clinical development and application is lacking. However, APS has been reported to have good prevention and improvement effects on ischemic stroke, Alzheimer disease, and some nerve injury symptoms [ , ]. \n\nBased on these reports, the present study was performed to evaluate the effects of APS on the protection of neurons and mitochondrial function in a mouse PD model. \n\n\n## Material and Methods \n  \n### Animal model of PD and drug administration \n  \nC57B/6 mice (male, 5\u20138 weeks old) were used to make the animal models for this study; they were fed and housed at 22\u00b12\u00b0C, with a12-hour light cycle at an animal experimental center. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee in the hospital and conformed with the guidelines of the National Institution of Health. \n\nThe mice were divided into 4 groups. Mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-pheyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intraperitoneally (25 mg/kg, 1 time/day for 7 days) to make the PD model. The mice in the control group were given the same dose of physiological saline in the first 5 days. On days 8 to 21 of the experiment, APS (10 mg/kg, 1 time/day) was intraperitoneally injected into the mice in the MPTP+APS group and the control+APS group, and the same dose of physiological saline was injected into the control group and the MPTP group. \n\n\n### Behavioral experiment \n  \n#### Climb pole testing \n  \nThe climb pole test was used to detect mouse movement coordination ability 1 day after dosing; the mice were adapted to the test environment 2 days before a test. A piece of wood 55 cm long and 1 cm in diameter was used for testing, and a wooden ball with a diameter of 2.5 cm was fixed at the top of the wood; cotton yarn was wrapped around the wood to prevent the mice from slipping. At the time of the test, we recorded the time it took for the mouse to climb from the bottom of the ball to the bottom of the wood as T . The test was repeated 3 times, with a 5-minute rest between each time. \n\n\n#### Open field testing \n  \nThe open field test was used to detect the physical activity of the mice and the degree of mental depression. An uncapped square box with a size of 40\u00d740\u00d710 cm was prepared for the testing, and the bottom of the box was divided into 16 parts. At the beginning of the test, the mouse was placed in the left rear area of the box, and then allowed free exercise for 5 minutes. The mouse speed (V) and the residence time in the central region (T) were recorded. \n\n\n\n### TH-positive neurons in substantia nigra \n  \nOn the second day after the behavioral testing, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium (10 mg/kg), the chest was quickly opened, and a saline rinse applied. A total of 40 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer fixative was used to infuse the mice after the liver became white. After the limbs were stiff, we quickly removed the brain tissue, and fixed it in 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer for 48 hours, and 20% sucrose solution overnight in 4\u00b0C. Then tissue slices were made using a thermostat slicer (SLEE, CUT4062, Germany). \n\nThe slices were warmed in 0.01 M PBS for 0.5 hours and rinsed 3 times with PBS (10 minutes each time) before immunocytochemistry. The substantia nigra slices were stained with rabbit anti-TH polyclonal antibody (ABCAM, UK) which was diluted by 3% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 (1: 400), followed by fluorescein labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1: 500, Abcam, Ltd., UK). The fluorescence microscopy (BX51, OLYMPUS, Japan) was used to observe the staining results, and TH-positive neurons were counted by Photoshop CS 5 (Adobe, Ltd., USA). \n\n\n### Mitochondrial structure \n  \nThe substantia nigra was obtained as previously described, then placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24 hours in 4\u00b0C, followed by 2% osmic acid for 2 hours at room temperature, 30% and 50% ethanol dehydration for 15 minutes, 70% uranyl acetate saturated with ethanol for 12 hours, 80% and 95% ethanol dehydration for 15 minutes, 100% ethanol dehydration 2 times, once for 40 minutes, epichlorohydrin for 30 minutes, and then embedded with Epon 812 epoxy embedding kit. The slices were obtained using an ultra-thin slicer (LKB-III, LKB, Sweden), and were double-stained with uranium acetate and lead nitrate. The transmission electron microscopy (H-7500, Hitachi, Ltd., Japan) was used to observe the mitochondrial structure. \n\n\n### Mitochondrial transmembrane potential \n  \nThe substantia nigra was obtained as previously described. We added 0.25% trypsin (HyClone, USA) for 30 minutes in 37\u00b0C, terminated the incubation with cell culture medium, cells filtered using 200 mesh cell sieves, and cells collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, for 5 minutes (Eppendorf, Germany). A total of 1\u00d710  cells was diluted by 100 uL PBS buffer for mitochondrial membrane potential detection, then 10 ug/mL Rho123 buffer (SIGMA, Germany) was added to cells for 30 minutes, incubated at 37\u00b0C, and the mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by flow cytometry (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The average fluorescence intensity was used to represent the mitochondrial membrane potential. \n\n\n### Reactive oxygen species (ROS) \n  \nThe substantia nigra was obtained as previously described. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) of mitochondrial in neurons of substantia nigra was detected by ROS Assay Kit (Sigma, Germany). \n\n\n### Western blot \n  \nThe substantia nigra was placed in a 2 mL tube. Total Protein Extraction Kit-tissue (Beyotime, China) was used to extract the total protein. The concentration of total protein was detected by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, China). Protein were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (300 mA, 1.5 hours) and western blotting; with bax, bcl-2, cytochrome-c, and caspase-3 rabbit monoclonal antibodies (ABCAM, UK) as the first antibody, and alkaline enzyme labeled horse anti-rabbit IgG (ABCAM, UK) as the second antibody. \n\n\n### Drugs and data analysis \n  \nMPTP, pentobarbital sodium, sucrose, Triton X-100, osmic acid, and all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma, Germany). APS was isolated and purified as described previously [ ]. \n\nAll data were analyzed by SPSS20.0;   t  -test or one-way analysis of variance ANOVA was used to compare differences between groups for the data on behavioral scoring, TH-positive neuronal ratio, mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and protein expression levels. A   P   value less than 0.05 was considered a significant difference. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### APS attenuated MPTP-induced motor dysfunction \n  \nThe mice were observed to have gradual exercise reduction, limb tremor, bow and gait instability, and other motor dysfunction symptoms after intraperitoneally treated with MPTP, and the symptoms gradually improved after APS treatment. \n\nAs shown in  , the T  of the mice in the MPTP group was 33.67\u00b13.81 seconds, which was significantly higher than in the control group (15.33\u00b11.68 seconds   P  <0.01). After treatment with APS for 14 days, the T  of the mice in the MPTP+APS group decreased to 24.67\u00b12.85 seconds ( ). The T of the mice in the MPTP group was 13.93\u00b11.91 seconds, which was significantly higher than in the control group (5.06\u00b11.22 seconds,   P  <0.01). After treatment with APS for 14 days, the T of the mice in the MPTP+APS group was decreased to 10.4\u00b11.88 seconds ( ). The V of the mice in the MPTP group was 1.99 \u00b1 0.47 seconds, which was significantly less than in the control group (5.49\u00b10.55 seconds,   P  <0.01). After treatment with APS for 14 days, the V of the mice in the MPTP+APS group increased to 4.48\u00b10.49 seconds ( ). \n\n\n### APS attenuated MPTP-induced TH-positive neurons decreased \n  \nTH-positive neurons were mainly distributed in SNpc, which was observed using fluorescent fiber. After intraperitoneal treatment with MPTP, the TH-positive neurons of substantia nigra were decreased to 36.67% compared to the control group. However, TH-positive neurons of substantia nigra were increased to 64.31% compared to the control group after APS treatment ( ). \n\n\n### APS attenuated MPTP-induced neurons mitochondrial structure change \n  \nMitochondrial structure changes were macroscopic manifestations of mitochondrial damage. In the control group, the neuron mitochondrial structure in substantia nigra were small, round or oval, with structural integrity and uniform density of the matrix electrons, following ridge distribution rules. After treatment with MPTP, the mitochondrial chamber expanded, the electron density was significantly reduced, and the mitochondria structure changed to loose vacuoles, and there was obvious swelling; mitochondrial crista became short and less. Treatment with APS could reverse these changes in the mitochondrial structure. First, mitochondrial edema was significantly reduced when compared with the MPTP group. Second, the mitochondrial structure was basically complete in the MPTP+APS group, and only part of the mitochondrial crest became shorter or fractured. Third, the mitochondrial matrix density was still reduced ( ). \n\n\n### Effects of APS on mitochondrial function of neurons \n  \nAfter intraperitoneal treatment with MPTP, the ROS level was increased by 51.87%   vs.   the control group, and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was decreased by 15.53   vs.   the control group. After APS treatment, the ROS level decreased by 20.63%   vs.   the MPTP group, and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential increased by 8.27   vs.   the MPTP group ( ). \n\n\n### Effects of APS on changes of bax/bcl-2 and expression of cytochrome and caspase-3 in the MPTP-induced mice \n  \nAs show in  , the expression of bax, cytochrome-c, pro-caspase-3, and caspase-3 protein increased significantly after induction by MPTP, but the expression of bcl-2 was just the opposite. Seven days after injection of MPTP, the mice were injected with APS for 2 consecutive weeks, then we found the expression of bax, cytochrome-c, pro-caspase-3, and caspase-3 protein decreased significantly, compared with the control group. Bcl-2 increased significantly. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPD is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly occurs in middle-aged and elderly patients and is characterized by a loss of projecting dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main mechanisms of PD. Protecting and repairing damaged neurons and mitochondria is the primary pathway for the prevention and treatment of PD [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAPS is extracted from astragalus, and its injection has a wide range of clinical applications. APS not only increases the growth and number of neuronal axons by promoting the secretion of nerve growth factor [ ], but it also may play a vital role in neuronal growth, as well as survival and injury repair by promoting the secretion of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor [ ]. In addition, APS may suppress mitochondrial ROS in mesenchymal stem cells [ ], inhabit liver mitochondrial permeability transition, and scavenge superoxide anion, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide [ ]. Thus, APS has potential value in the treatment of PD. \n\nThe mouse model of PD in this study was prepared by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP. MPTP is a fat-soluble neurotoxic agent, which can quickly penetrate the blood-brain barrier and produce a toxic effect of MPP+ by metabolism. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra would then undergo abnormal change or absence because of reduced ATP and risen ROS when MPP+ enters dopaminergic neurons and is absorbed and concentrated by the mitochondria. But we found that APS not only attenuated MPTP-induced motor dysfunction, but also attenuated MPTP-induced tyrosine hydrogenase (TH)-positive neurons decrease. PD would appear when 50% of dopaminergic neurons were missing in substantia nigra [ ]. And TH was a synthetic rate limiting enzyme of dopaminergic neurons, which was positively correlated with dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, TH-positive cells in the PD model that had motor dysfunction accounted for only 36.67% of health mice. Mice treated with APS not only improved in motor dysfunction, but also TH-positive cells increased by 75.44%. This suggests that there was a closely relation between motor dysfunction and the absence of TH-positive cells in our mouse model of PD. Thus, promoting the proliferation of TH-positive cells would help in the prevention and treatment of PD [ \u2013 ]. \n\nMitochondria is an important organelle for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production of cells. It plays an important role in maintaining normal physiological function of cells. Mitochondrial plays a normal function only with a complete structure; however, when a series of dysfunctions occurs, the mitochondrial structure is destroyed [ , ]. In the present study, we found that the mitochondrial structure in neurons was destroyed, mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased, and mitochondrial ROS was increased in the MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. OS has been shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases [ , ], including PD [ ]. ROS, coming from OS, could cause DNA fragmentation, lipid autoxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and the lack of mitochondrial function will further produce more ROS [ \u2013 ]. In our study, we found that APS attenuated the MPTP-induced raised ROS. Thus, APS can be used to treat PD by suppressing the production of ROS, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. \n\nThe normal mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) is based on maintaining the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, which is necessary for normal mitochondrial function. The protein of cytochrome-c in the cytoplasm increases because of decreasing MTP, which then activates caspase-3, eventually causing apoptosis [ ]; as was shown in our study. \n\nIn addition, our study also found that APS could reduce the bax/bcl2 ratio in the substantia nigra in a PD mouse model. Bcl2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, and bax is a pro-apoptotic protein. They co-control the apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome-c protein, and activation of capase-3 protein and mitochondrial function [ , ]. When the bax/bcl2 ratio increases, cytochrome-c is released from the mitochondria. Caspase-3 is activated by cytochrome-c, and mitochondrial function is lost, eventually causing apoptosis. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nAPS provided protective effects to neurons and mitochondria in a mouse model of PD at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 14 days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of APS in a mouse model of PD, although there are many studies on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by APS. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6074062, "text_md5": "81383043a2fa602f432322db6f39f247", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 99], "publication_year": [101, 105], "title": [116, 225], "keywords": [239, 296], "abstract": [309, 1474], "body": [1483, 18607]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30048421, "doi": "10.12659/MSM.908021", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074062", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6074062"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074062\">6074062</a>", "list_title": "PMC6074062  Astragalus Polysaccharide Protects Neurons and Stabilizes Mitochondrial in a Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease"}

Voxel-level neuroanatomic features were estimated with deformation-based morphometry (DBM) of T1-weighted MRI. Voxels with deformation values that were significantly correlated (  p   < 0.01) with clinical scores (Movement Disorder Society\u2013sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale Parts I\u2013III and total score, tremor score, and postural instability and gait difficulty score) at baseline were selected. Then, these neuroanatomic features were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis. Changes in the longitudinal progression and neuroanatomic pattern were compared between different biotypes. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nTwo neuroanatomic biotypes were identified: biotype 1 (n = 114) with subcortical brain volumes smaller than heathy controls and biotype 2 (n = 200) with subcortical brain volumes larger than heathy controls. Biotype 1 had more severe motor impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and much worse REM sleep behavior disorder than biotype 2 at baseline. Although disease durations at the initial visit and follow-up were similar between biotypes, patients with PD with smaller subcortical brain volume had poorer prognosis, with more rapid decline in several clinical domains and in dopamine functional neuroimaging over an average of 5 years. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nRobust neuroanatomic biotypes exist in PD with distinct clinical and neuroanatomic patterns. These biotypes can be detected at diagnosis and predict the course of longitudinal progression, which should benefit trial design and evaluation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nPatients with Parkinson disease (PD) present heterogeneous motor and nonmotor clinical manifestations and have a variable prognosis.  Although the diagnosis of PD is dependent on the presence of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity, some nonmotor phenomena\u2014e.g., REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), hyposmia, and depression\u2014can precede motor deficits by several years. Conversely, as the disease progresses, nonmotor problems such as autonomic disturbances, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairment can dominate the clinical picture in some patients.  Recent evidence suggests that PD may have several biotypes,  but their identity and neurobiological basis remain poorly understood.  Assuming that homogeneous groups of patients are more likely to share pathologic features, recognition of different subcategories of patients with PD may be key to better understanding underlying biological mechanisms, predicting disease profile and progression, and eventually designing more efficient personalized clinical trials. \n\nSubtypes of PD have previously been defined mainly according to clinical symptoms and demographic characteristics.  However, cluster results are only as good as the data that underpin them, and the depths of phenotypic information used by these studies were variable, resulting in quite heterogeneous and controversial clusters.  In addition, these clinical data-driven PD subtype classification systems may suffer from lack reproducibility.  An alternative to subtyping patients with PD on the basis of co-occurring clinical symptoms is to identify neuroanatomic biotypes by clustering patients according to shared neuroanatomic signatures, which can objectively capture different aspects of patient characteristics. Studying brain neuroanatomic patterns of PD provides an opportunity to examine biological heterogeneity in vivo.  Data-driven methods provide an unbiased approach to detect groups of patients with similar profiles across multiple neuroanatomic feature dimensions and thus may yield a more refined description of heterogeneity in PD. T1-weighted MRI is an especially suitable modality to describe brain anatomy with high resolution and to quantify regional brain volumes.  Brain volume may mediate brain reserve, which promotes the resilience of large-scale brain networks and helps maintain normal function in the face of neurodegeneration.  Previous studies have shown that subcortical volume loss reflects clinical measures of disease severity and is related to the development of cognitive impairment.  These studies raise the intriguing possibility that T1-weighted MRI measures of brain volume could be leveraged to identify biotypes of PD. Critically, such PD biotypes defined by brain volume at diagnosis may predict disease progression, which may be advantageous in helping to determine prognosis and to identify subgroups for clinical trials. Cluster analysis in nondemented PD with limited sampling of patients showed different PD cortical thinning subtypes.  These PD subtypes also showed different cortical thinning progression over time, but the difference between motor symptoms and the rates of disease progression of the different subtypes was not reported. Severity and rate of disease progression are an important issue in PD therapeutics, and identifying progression biotypes of PD at diagnosis with the use of neuroanatomic patterns may be one way to address heterogeneity in PD. \n\nIn this study, we used data-driven clustering approaches to identify neuroanatomic biotypes in patients with early PD in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI;  ) database  according to the neuroanatomic pattern derived by deformation-based morphometry (DBM).  DBM is based on nonlinear and intensity-based registration procedures that spatially normalize the entire brain to a standard template.  DBM does not assume the distributions of gray matter or white matter and preserves the entirety of the MRI data. PD involves axonal degeneration and neuronal cell death, with the latter being indexed by gray matter atrophy, which is a relatively late event in the pathogenesis of PD.  Moreover, neurodegeneration in PD initially preferentially affects subcortical regions through a purported disease-spreading process.  A particularly strong aspect of the DBM method is that it enables the detection of subcortical neuroanatomic features,  and previous studies have shown that DBM can detect morphologic tissue changes in patients with early-stage PD.  Therefore, DBM is particularly suitable for PD biotype discovery compared to cortical thinning patterns and voxel-based morphometry. We hypothesize that if heterogeneity in clinical symptoms reflects true neuroanatomic biotypes of PD, then such neuroanatomic biotypes should be detectable in early disease and might predict the type of symptoms or disease progression that a patient will develop. The aims of our study were (1) to identify biotypes of PD with cluster analysis based on a baseline neuroimaging dataset; (2) to introduce a practical clinical typing method, which assigns individual patients to their biotype; and (3) to compare the behavioral assessments and rate of disease progression between different PD biotypes. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents \n  \nThe study was approved by the institutional review board at each PPMI site. Written informed consent for research was obtained from all participants in the study. \n\n\n### Overall design \n  \nA flowchart of the analysis is shown in  . We began by designing and implementing a preprocessing procedure to control for site- and age-related effects in a multisite dataset that comprised structural MRI scans for 457 participants (n = 314 patients with PD, n = 143 healthy controls). A graphic summary of the participants selection is shown in data available from Dryad (figure e-1,  ). Patients and controls were matched for age and sex. DBM was used to detect the volume of each voxel compared to the template brain.  Next, to select features for use in clustering, we used Spearman rank correlation analysis to identify a low-dimensional representation of neuroanatomic features that were associated with baseline clinical symptoms within patients with PD, including Movement Disorder Society\u2013sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts I, II, III, tremor, and postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) scores. To capture more neuroanatomic features related to PD, correlations were not corrected for multiple comparisons, but the dimensions of selected features were further reduced by principal components analysis. Then, hierarchical clustering was used to discover clusters of patients according to the principal components. Finally, to validate the clustering results, we investigated differences in follow-up clinical symptoms and neuroanatomic patterns between subgroups of patients, and we investigated the extent to which the analysis could reliably discriminate between different subgroups of patients using a pattern classification approach. \n   Schematic overview of the design of this study  \nDBM = deformation-based morphometry; PCA = principal component analysis; UPDRS = Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale. \n  \n\n### Study setting and patients \n  \nThe PPMI ( ) is a landmark observational, longitudinal database consisting of neuroimaging, biological tests, and clinical and behavioral assessments in >400 patients with de novo PD.  All patients underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the DAT deficit. All clinical features were reassessed annually over 5 years so that markers of disease progression could be discerned. The neuroimaging data and extensive longitudinal clinical information provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify the neuroanatomic biotypes of PD and the longitudinal assessment of PD progression of different biotypes in patients with de novo PD. The clinical and behavioral assessments have been described extensively elsewhere. \n\nRecruitment criteria included age >30 years, PD diagnosis within the last 2 years, baseline Hoehn and Yahr stage I to II, and no anticipated need for symptomatic treatment within 6 months of baseline.  Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, at 3-months interval during the first year of participation, and then every 6 months thereafter (see data available from Dryad, table e-1,  ). Data from the PPMI database were obtained in May 2018 in compliance with the PPMI Data Use Agreement. \n\n\n### Baseline and clinical assessments \n  \nA comprehensive set of clinical assessments were evaluated in PPMI. We focused on clinical features that capture major PD symptoms, including both motor and nonmotor symptoms, in line with previous studies.  Details of clinical assessments used in this study are presented in PPMI ( ). Derived variable definitions and score calculations are available in the PPMI (in the Study_Docs). A list of abbreviations of clinical assessments is given in data available from Dryad (table e-2,  ). Features captured include the following:   \nDemographics: age, sex, race, symptom duration, and education level. \n  \nBlood biomarkers: biochemical tests. \n  \nMotor: MDS-UPDRS Parts I through III,  tremor/PIGD motor phenotype, PIGD, tremor subscale, and Schwab-England activities of daily living scores. \n  \nCognitive testing: cognitive function (age/education adjusted Montreal Cognitive Assessment total score)  and neuropsychological variables, including visuospatial and visuoperceptual functions (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation),  cognition performance (Symbol Digit Modalities Test),  verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test for total recall, delayed recall, retention, and recognition-discrimination),  semantic memory (Semantic Verbal Fluency test),  and working memory capacity (letter-number sequencing). \n  \nAutonomic testing: autonomic dysfunction (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease\u2013Autonomic total score and its subscores: cardiovascular, constipation, orofacial, thermoregulatory, sexual, pupillomotor, and urinary). \n  \nSleep disorders: RBD (RBD Screening Questionnaire score),  average sleep propensity in daily life (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score). \n  \nNeurobehavior: depression (Geriatric Depression Scale score),  trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score),  and impulse control disorders and related disorders (Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease score). \n  \nOlfactory testing: impaired olfaction (age/sex adjusted University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test score). \n  \nPhysical activity: Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly.  Three activity categories were assessed: leisure, household chores, and work/volunteering. \n  \n\n\n### CSF and SPECT biomarkers \n  \nA lumbar puncture was conducted for all participants for the collection of CSF. \u03b2-Amyloid  phosphorylated tau, and total tau protein were measured by INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay (Innogenetics Inc, Ghent, Belgium), and \u03b1-synuclein concentration was measured by ELISA. SPECT with the DAT tracer  I-ioflupane was acquired at baseline and follow-up visits. \n\n\n### Imaging processing \n  \nT1-weighted MRI scan acquisition parameters are detailed elsewhere ( ). \n\nThe T1-weighted MRI images were preprocessed with the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT 12) ( ), which is an extension of SPM12 to provide computational anatomy. All these images were corrected for bias, noise, and intensity and linearly and then nonlinearly registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute 152-2009c template. Then the DBM (i.e., the determinant of the jacobian transformation matrix) maps were calculated to estimate the local volume in each voxel (DBM values). Raw images of lower quality (CAT image quality rating <75%) were excluded. The rest images were further visually checked. Finally, the obtained preprocessed volume-based DBM data from 314 patients with PD and 145 healthy controls were smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half-maximum. \n\nFor volumetric analysis, FreeSurfer version 5.3 was used to derive measures of the volume of subcortical nuclei. This is a well-documented and freely available software. \n\n\n### Voxel-level association study and clustering \n  \nWe reasoned that a low-dimensional representation of a subset of neuroanatomic features would best characterize biologically meaningful PD biotypes, similar to the atrophy subtypes detected in prodromal Alzheimer disease.  Therefore, to select a set of neuroanatomic features for use in clustering, we used Spearman rank correlation analysis to identify features that were significantly correlated (  p   < 0.01) with clinical scores (baseline value): the MDS-UPDRS Parts I to III, UPDRS total, tremor, and PIGD scores. Confounding factors such as age, sex, years of education, race (categorized as white or other), and site effect were regressed out before feature selection. \n\nTo further exclude undesired background noise, principal component analysis was used to extract a lower-dimensional component space of the selected features (79 principal components were used capturing 90% of the variance). Then we used hierarchical clustering to assign participants to nested subgroups with similar pattern. We calculated a similarity matrix describing the correlation distance between every pair of participants, and then we used the Ward minimum variance method to iteratively link pairs of participants in closest proximity, forming progressively larger clusters in a hierarchical tree. Calinski-Harabasz criterion values were used to estimate the optimal number of clusters, and the result suggested 2 clusters as the best choice (see data available from Dryad, figure e-2,  ). Furthermore, to validate the clustering, we also clustered data using k-means clustering. The Cohen \u03ba agreement rate between hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering was 0.68, which is in the substantial range, suggesting that the patterns identified by the 2 different clustering methods were similar (see data available from Dryad, figure e-3). \n\n\n### Classification \n  \nTo further test the clinical relevance of the identified neuroanatomic features as diagnostic features of biotypes, we applied a support vector machine to test how well this could discriminate these 2 biotypes, that is, classify individuals into 1 of these 2 subgroups. A 10-fold cross-validation strategy was used to estimate its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The details of classification are depicted in data available from Dryad (figure e-4,  ). \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \n#### Demographics and clinical variables \n  \nThe   t   test was used to determine the statistical significance of continuous demographic and clinical variables after the removal of confounding variables: age, sex, years of education, race (categorized as white or other), and site effect. The \u03c7  test was used to test the significance of categorical demographic variables and phenotype variables. Statistical significance was established at   p   < 0.05 (false discovery rate [FDR] correction), and the values were reported as mean (SD) for each demographic and clinical variable. Missing data were not included in all analysis. \n\n\n#### Linear mixed model fitting for disease progression rates \n  \nWe estimated rates of progression for each patient with 5 years of follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate baseline and disease progression rates over time in patients classified in the subtypes using the lme4 package in R.  Sex, age, sites, race, time from baseline (months), biotype, and their interaction were included as fixed effects. Participant intercepts and slopes (rates of progression) were modeled as random effects. \n\n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nAll deidentified clinical and imaging data are available on the PPMI website ( ) and from the corresponding author on reasonable request. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Baseline dataset characteristics \n  \nA total of 314 early patients with PD were included in this study consisting of 207 (65.9%) men and 107 (34.1%) women. On average, these patients with PD were 61.0 \u00b1 9.5 years of age with a disease duration (date of enrollment minus the date of diagnosis) of 6.9 \u00b1 6.8 months at baseline. The mean MDS-UPDRS Parts I through III scores were 5.6 \u00b1 4.0, 5.9 \u00b1 4.2, and 20.7 \u00b1 8.7. Clinical, biological, and cognitive characteristics of early patients with PD and matched healthy controls are given in  . \n  \nDemographic, clinical, and imaging characteristics of controls and PD biotype groups \n  \n\n### Neuroanatomic features associated with the symptoms of PD \n  \n shows the correlation analysis between deformation values and baseline clinical scores. We found that a number of neuroanatomic features correlated with UPDRS scores, including areas spanning the caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, supplementary motor area, and orbital frontal gyrus ( ). These areas are consistent with previous findings that subcortical volume loss correlates with motor symptom severity.  This empirical, data-driven approach to feature selection identified 23,213 voxel DBM values that were correlated with at least 1 baseline clinical score ( ). \n   Correlation between DBM values and symptom scores  \nWarm color indicates a positive correlation between symptom scores and deformation-based morphometry (DBM) values; cold color indicates a negative correlation between symptom scores and DBM values. (A) Correlation between DBM values and Movement Disorder Society\u2013sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part I score. (B) Correlation between DBM values and MDS-UPDRS Part II score. (C) Correlation between DBM values and MDS-UPDRS III score. (D) Correlation between DBM values and MDS-UPDRS total score. (E) Correlation between DBM values and tremor score. (F) Correlation between DBM values and postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) score. In total, 8,855, 2,826, 4,201, 6,064, 6,994, and 1,380 deformation values correlated with UPDRS Part I, UPDRS Part II, UPDRS Part III, total UPDRS, PIGD, and tremor scores, respectively (  p   < 0.01, uncorrected). \n  \n\n### Brain neuroanatomic patterns define 2 PD biotypes \n  \nWe then tested whether these neuroanatomic feature sets tended to cluster in patient subgroups. As illustrated in   and data available from Dryad (figure e-3,  ), the cluster analysis revealed 2 distinct clusters of patients with PD, with similar disease duration (  p   = 0.35,  ). These 2 clusters comprised 36.31% (114 patients) and 63.69% (200 patients) of the 314 patients with PD.   shows the demographic characteristics of the 2 biotype groups. There was no significant difference in age, sex, education, symptom duration, or ratio of PIGD- and tremor-dominant patients between the 2 biotype groups (  and data available from Dryad, table e-3). \n   Dendrogram of the final hierarchical cluster solution of patients with PD in the PPMI patients  \nMatrix under the dendrogram shows the distance of the neuroanatomic patterns between different patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Each element (i row and j column) in the matrix indicates the difference of the neuroanatomic patterns between the i participant and j participant. PPMI = Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. \n  \n\n### Neuroanatomic pattern of the 2 biotypes \n  \nTo illustrate the neuroanatomic pattern in the different PD biotypes, the DBM values of the 2 biotypes were compared with those of controls. Compared to normal controls, individuals with both biotypes showed significant differences in subcortical regions.   shows the comparison between each biotype and healthy controls (  p   < 0.005, FDR correction). \n   Different neuroanatomic patterns in the 2 PD biotypes compared with healthy controls  \nWarm color indicates higher deformation-based morphometry (DBM) values in patients with Parkinson disease (PD); cold color indicates lower DBM values (  p   < 0.005, false discovery rate correction). (A) The   t   values of comparison of DBM values between biotype 1 and controls. (B) The   t   values of comparison of DBM values between biotype 2 and controls. \n  \nThose with biotype 1 had pronounced differences compared to normal controls in almost the whole brain, indicating more severe atrophy in brain areas in early PD. Those with biotype 2 had predominant differences in the subcortical regions. In addition, we found other distinct patterns that differentiated the 2 biotypes. For example, compared to controls, DBM values in the putamen, caudate, pallidum, lingual gyrus, temporal cortex, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, and orbital frontal cortex, which regulate motor-related, cognitive, and emotion-related behavior, were significantly lower in patients with biotype 1, which were characterized in part by increased motor and nonmotor symptom scores. In contrast, patients with biotype 2 had significantly higher DBM values in the brainstem, putamen, caudate, occipital lobe, lingual gyrus, olfactory, posterior cingulate cortex, and white matter areas compared to controls. Additional volumetric analyses with FreeSurfer showed that patients with biotype 1 had significantly lower subcortical volumes within the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus (  p   < 0.05, FDR correction) compared to patients with biotype 2 (see data available from Dryad, table e-4,  ). \n\n\n### Neuroanatomic patterns for diagnosing PD biotypes \n  \nWe reasoned that clustering could be used for training the classifiers for the diagnosis of PD biotypes solely on the basis of structural MRI measures. To this end, we trained classifiers for predicting the PD biotype in individual patients. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to assess performance and significance. Support vector machine classifiers (using gaussian kernel functions) yielded overall accuracy rates of 84.1% (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.89, area under the curve 0.90, data available from Dryad, figure e-6,  ) for the clusters characterized above. \n\n\n### Baseline differences in symptoms between biotypes \n  \n shows that at baseline patients with biotype 1 had worse mentation, behavior, and mood (higher MDS-UPDRS Part I score) and very much worse RBD Screening Questionnaire score than those with biotype 2. There was also evidence of more severe autonomic function in biotype 1 (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease total score) ( ). \n\n\n### Disease progression in the PD biotypes \n  \nThe PPMI patients were followed up for 5 years. The sample size of the progression analysis is shown in data available from Dryad (table e-1,  ). Results from a linear mixed model showed that the patients with biotype 1 had significantly greater progression in all MDS-UPDRS scores, with the exception of the tremor score (  and  ). In addition, those with biotype 1 tended to develop more severe cognitive impairment (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test immediate total recall, letter-number sequencing, and Symbol Digit Modalities) (  and data available from Dryad, figure e- 8). More rapid progression could also be seen in the patients with biotype 1 in activities of daily living (Schwab-England activities of daily living) (  and data available from Dryad, figure e-7). \n   Longitudinal changes in outcomes of interest in different biotypes of PD among the PPMI patients with 5 years of follow-up  \nAsterisks indicate the statistical significance of the comparison between 2 biotypes in the clinical variables at the time of different follow up (A\u2013F; *  p   < 0.05, **  p   < 0.01, ***  p   < 0.005, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data contain 1 baseline set of data and 12 follow-up sets of data over 5 years. PD = Parkinson disease; PIGD = postural instability and gait disorder; UPDRS = Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale. \n    \nLongitudinal motor and nonmotor score estimated \u03b2 coefficients in different biotypes of PD with covariate correction in the PPMI patients with 5 years of follow-up \n  \nOn dopaminergic SPECT scanning, patients with biotype 1 had worse denervation of both left caudate and left putamen after an average of 4 years of follow-up. The right caudate and right putamen showed no significant difference in denervation between the 2 biotypes (see data available from Dryad, figure e-13,  ). \n\nTo summarize, patients with biotype 1 had higher baseline MDS-UPDRS Part I score, worse baseline sleep problems and autonomic dysfunction, and faster progression of most motor symptoms, cognitive impairment, and activities of daily living compared to patients with biotype 2 (all   p   < 0.05, FDR correction) (  and  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we identified 2 neuroanatomic biotypes in patients with PD with otherwise similar demographics using an unbiased data-driven clustering approach applied to the PPMI cohort. Neuroanatomic biotypes differed in symptomatology even at presentation before treatment and thereafter progressed at different rates. The most striking baseline difference was the much higher RBD Screening Questionnaire score in biotype 1. \n\nOur results provide support for 2 different neuroanatomic phenotypes within patients with PD. Compared to healthy controls, the neuroanatomic differences were more widespread in patients with biotype 1, spanning across almost all of the brain. Compared to patients with biotype 1, patients with biotype 2 had less widespread differences at baseline. \n\nPatients with biotype 2 had larger subcortical volume (higher DBM values) than controls on average, suggesting they may contain more cells (including dopaminergic cells) and synapses, increasing the ability to support maintenance of function despite declines in brain volume. Accordingly, patients with biotype 2 had a slower disease progression rate.  In contrast, patients with biotype 1 had less brain reserve and did not compensate as well as those with biotype 1 as PD progressed over time, resulting in a faster disease progression rate. Indeed, there was evidence that this was already the case at the time of presentation, given the worse symptom severity in several domains in biotype 1 than in biotype 2. In summary, we hypothesize that the different rates of symptom progression relate to different brain reserves. \n\nBrain reserve describes the differences in brain volume and structure that may support maintenance of function despite pathology.  Gross or regional brain volume reflects the quantity of neurons, neuronal integrity, and synaptic densities, which determine the ability of the brain to engage in compensatory activity.  Prior works have highlighted a link between brain volume and markers of functional reserve in patients with PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.  For example, there is a relationship between brain gray matter volume and the magnitude of network-level integration.  Basal forebrain volume can predict future psychosis in early PD, and higher cholinergic nucleus 4 gray matter density is associated with a lower risk of reporting psychotic symptoms.  PD with cognitive impairment shows lower gray matter volume in the nucleus basalis of Meynert.  Compared to tremor-dominant patients, patients with PIGD had lower gray matter volumes in the globus pallidus and amygdala and have worse prognosis with a more rapid decline.  In line with these observations, our results suggest that a larger subcortical volume helps limit the negative impact of PD pathology during disease progression, as represented by brain atrophy. Physical exercise has been shown to increase brain volume in older adults.  Therefore, interventions that increase physical activity before or in the early course of PD may contribute to brain reserve and help slow the rates of disease progression. \n\nAt baseline, patients with biotype 1 had evidence of worse behavioral, autonomic, and motor impairment and, above all, of worse RBD symptomatology. These findings are consistent with past observations showing that motor dysfunction is associated with cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction, and RBD.  PD with RBD is also associated with faster motor progression and a higher risk of cognitive decline.  In line with these studies, we found that patients with biotype 1 had much worse RBD symptomatology and more cognitive decline. RBD may be a useful marker for early subtyping of PD at baseline.  Patients with biotype 1 had significantly higher scores in several motor disease symptoms after only 1 year of follow-up, but there was no difference in the progression of tremor between the 2 biotypes. This may reflect that rest tremor may be more closely related to degeneration of nondopaminergic, rather than dopaminergic, systems.  In most cases, there is a substantial asymmetry of clinical symptoms from disease onset, and patients with unilateral disease showed a significant difference in striatal uptake between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides in both the caudate and putamen nuclei.  Differences in longitudinal denervation between the left and right caudate and putamen between the 2 biotypes (see data available from Dryad, figure e-12,  ) may reflect different disease severity. Consistent with previous findings that CSF biomarkers are not useful biomarkers of PD progression,  our results did not show significant differences in CSF biomarker levels between the 2 biotypes at baseline ( ). \n\nWhile the 2 identified neuroanatomic biotypes showed group differences in terms of symptom severity and longitudinal progression, there is overlap in the neuroanatomic features at the individual level between the 2 biotypes. It is plausible that some patients were a combination of >1 biotype, and this would not be captured by our approach of discretizing biotypes. Future research should further investigate more refined biotype definitions based on continuous membership probability values through longitudinal studies in larger cohorts. Therefore, we regard the 2 biotypes identified here as just an initial solution to the problem of diagnostic heterogeneity in a subtyping process that relies primarily on neuroanatomic features correlated with clinical scores. It is likely that cohort limitations (the PPMI patients on the whole have a higher level of education, are younger, and have less baseline disability than the general PD population ), the size of our cluster-discovery dataset, and the subjectivity of clinical-symptom assessments were also limiting factors. For these reasons, a novel cohort with longitudinal clinical data will be useful for validating the present findings. \n\nWe show that neuroanatomic biotypes can be defined that robustly predict different rates of progression, suggesting that these reflect true biotypes of PD. Given that PPMI recruited early patients from multiple sites, our results should still be mostly generalizable to early PD in real clinical practice where the findings can be used to inform estimates of prognosis. These results might also have implications for clinical trial design in early PD in the future. The existence of neuroanatomic biotypes that show specific trajectories of clinical score decline may require biotype-specific outcome measures tailored to the expected rate of decline in different domains. \n\nWe have robustly identified 2 different neuroanatomic biotypes among patients with early PD using a data-driven clustering approach. These biotypes showed distinct neuroanatomic patterns, symptoms, and rates of progression.

The neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying FoG in PD are still unclear. The present study aims to explore alterations of structural gray matter (GM) in PD patients with FoG.   Method:   Twenty-four PD patients with FoG (FoG+), 37 PD patients without FoG (FoG-) and 24 healthy controls (HC) were included. All subjects underwent a standardized MRI protocol. The cortical thickness (CTh), segmentation volume without ventricles (BrainSegVolNotVent) and estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) were analysed using the FreeSurfer pipeline.   Results:   CTh differences were found in the right middle temporal gyrus (rMTG) generally. Compared to that in HCs, the CTh of the rMTG in both the FoG+ and FoG- groups was smaller, while no significant difference between the FoG+ and FoG- groups. Correlation analyses demonstrated a negative correlation between the CTh of the rMTG and the UPDRS part II score in PD subjects, and a borderline significant correlation between the score of Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FoGQ) and rMTG CTh. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed a cut-off point of CTh\u2009=3.08\u2009mm in the rMTG that could be used to differentiate PD patients and HCs (AUC\u2009=0.79, P\u2009<0.01). There were no differences in the BrainSegVolNotVent or eTIV among the 3 groups.   Conclusions:   Our findings currently suggest no significant difference between FoG+ and FoG- patients in terms of structural gray matter changes. However, decreased CTh in the rMTG related to semantic control may be used as a biomarker to differentiate PD patients and HCs. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) remains as a challenging health problem, especially among elderly people, worldwide [ ]. Approximately 17/1000 people above the age of 65 years old suffer from Parkinson's disease [ ]. Freezing of gait (FoG), defined as a brief, episodic restriction or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk [ ], is one of the most notable characteristics of advanced Parkinson's disease. It may cause patients decreased mobility, reduction in quality of life, and even bring about accidents due to falling. However, the mechanism behind FoG has yet to be fully discovered. A more concrete explanation of mechanisms behind FoG will not only guide early prevention and cure of this phenomenon but also help to understand the physiology of normal locomotion generation, control and management in humans. \n\nCurrently, Parkinson's disease is widely understood as a neurodegenerative disease [ ]. There is evidence that degeneration of cholinergic neurons in PD patients may contribute to the onset of FoG [ ]. Fortunately, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided us with various methods to investigate neural degeneration in vivo. Recently, MRI-based quantitative neuroanatomical approaches have been used to assess various disorders. In particular, cortical thickness (CTh), measured as the width of the cortical gray matter layers that cover the surface of the brain, has shown conspicuous advantages compared to other parameters, and has been considered as a possible biomarker for quite a few neurological disorders [ \u2013 ]. It is able to reach sub-voxel level precision, enabling more accurate measurement in deep sulci [ ]. Moreover, changes in cortical thickness may occur before neuronal death, supporting the indication capability of CTh in diseases' preclinical stages [ ]. There are already a handful of studies using cortex-based method to explore specific clinical-relevant situations in PD. Previous studies have found that CTh reduction in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital areas occurs in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in early PD, while disease stage is negatively correlated with CTh in multiple brain regions [ ]. Therefore, exploring possible role of CTh as a biomarker in PD with FoG and establishing disease model therewith may facilitate early detection of the situation at quantitative level, enabling early intervention at precise brain circuits affected, thus improving quality of life, preventing accidents related to motor disabilities. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, at the time of this study, only 2 studies had explored the cortical pattern of freezing of gait with cortex-based methods. One study discovered CTh reduction in the left supplementary motor area, middle/anterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole and right frontal operculum of FoG positive PD patients in contrast to FoG negative ones. However, the study did not include healthy control participants [ ]. The other study has found cortex degeneration in superior frontal gyrus, paracentral lobule, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and pericalcarine cortex, as well as right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in comparison with HC, but no significant difference was found between FoG positive and FoG negative subjects [ ]. The discrepancy of their findings may possibly be related to differences of details in cortex-based analysis processes, as well as variance in disease severity between the two populations of patients. This inevitably resulted in an ambiguous understanding of the neuroanatomical features behind FoG. Meanwhile, both of the two studies focused on Caucasian subjects, which implies that this may be the first study to investigate Asian population about PD FoG so far. \n\nIn this study, we planned to use the structural gray matter method to explore possible neural degeneration in both hemispheres in PD patients with FoG and tried to analyse the relationship of cortical thickness and disease severity. Additionally, we tried to identify whether the alteration of CTh in brain regions present is specific to FoG positive patients with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. \n\n\n## 2. Method \n  \n### 2.1. Participants \n  \nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangzhou First People's Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent before examination. Sixty-one patients with Parkinson's disease in Guangzhou First People's Hospital were selected from 2017.3 to 2018.11. Inclusion criteria were as the following: (1) Diagnosed with PD according to the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank criteria; and (2) Right-handed as defined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Patients were excluded when the following situations were present: (1) Stage 5 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H-Y); (2) Secondary PD syndrome due to other reasons; (3) Inability to cooperate for the MRI scanning procedures due to severe motion disorder; (4) History of other neural system diseases, such as stroke or brain trauma; (5) History of severe disease of the motor system, such as osteoarthropathy, osteomyopathy or arthroplasty; (6) History of psychiatric disorders; (7) Presence of implanted objects in the head such as false teeth, which may cause artefacts in the image. \n\nPatients were recognized as FoG+ if they scored >0 on questions 3-6 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FoGQ), along with clinical diagnosis by a professional neurologist (M.L, with >20 years experiences). Twenty-four PD patients were defined as freezing of gait positive (FoG+), and 37 PD patients were freezing of gait negative (FoG-). Disease stages were then assessed in two groups of PD subjects by the H-Y scale. General daily performance and drug complications were evaluated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part I to IV, and cognitive status with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The presence and severity of FOG was evaluated by FOGQ. \n\nThe pharmacological treatment of both FoG+ and FoG- patients was recorded in the form of daily Levodopa equivalent dose (LED). The dose of dopamine replacement medication was converted by the formula in previous papers. \n\nTwenty-four healthy controls (HCs) were also recruited in our study using the following inclusion criteria: (1) no severe clinical disease, (2) normal state of mind and self-management ability, (3) right-handed as defined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) neuropsychiatric disorder, (2) recent intake of neuropsychiatric medicine in the previous 1 week before MRI examination, (3) self-reported cognitive impairment or MMSE<24, and (4) brain lesion >1\u2009cm or moderate or greater white matter hyperintensity on MR images. The cognitive status of HCs was also assessed with MMSE. \n\n\n### 2.2. Image Data Acquisition \n  \nParticipants underwent an MRI scans using a 3.0\u2009T MRI scanner (Siemens Verio, Erlangen, Germany) with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence. The scanning protocol was as follows: repetition time (TR)\u2009=1900\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=2.19\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=9\u00b0, field of view (FOV) = 250\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009mm, slice thickness of 1.0\u2009mm, and 256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256 acquisition matrix. The time for a single scan was 6 minutes and 1 second. All image data acquired was visually inspected by a professional radiologist (X.R) to ensure quality. Image would only be used with no visible motion artifact as well as substantial contrast between grey matter and white matter. All PD subjects were scan under \u201cON\u201d state. \n\n\n### 2.3. Gray Matter Analysis \n  \n#### 2.3.1. Cortical Thickness Analysis \n  \nThe analysis of cortical thickness was carried out with the FreeSurfer toolkit ( ). Firstly, the intensity of T1-weighted images was normalized. Then, a skull-strip algorithm removed the skull and all non-brain tissues (scalp, skins and eyeball) from the image, and a mask of gross brain tissue was created. The brain tissue of each subject was then segmented into different regions. Next, white matter and gray matter surfaces were tessellated, transforming 3D voxels of the brain into 2D curvatures. Boundaries of white matter and gray matter (pial surface) were then identified. Cortical thickness was defined as the shortest distance between the two boundaries above each vertex. The image data for the whole brain were sequentially inflated into a sphere and registered on the MNI template. After that, a smoothing process was performed with a 10-mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Finally, image data for the cortex were mapped back to each individual according to sulci and gyri. All of the processes above were executed automatically in the FreeSurfer \u201crecon-all\u201d pipeline. The results after processing were visually inspected in case error and bias existed. \n\n\n#### 2.3.2. Cortical Volume Analysis \n  \nThe brain segmentation volume without ventricles (BrainSegVolNotVent) value and estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) of each subject were also calculated by the pipeline. \n\n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nComparison of age and the MMSE score were conducted with ANOVA and sex composition were compared using Chi-square test between the 3 groups. The difference in Disease duration, LED, H-Y score, UPDRS part I score, UPDRS part IV score and the FoGQ scores between FoG+ and FoG- groups of PD patients were analysed with Mann\u2013Whitney   U   tests, and the UPDRS score of part II and III with t-tests. \n\nA general linear model (GLM) analysis was applied to identify difference in CTh at vertex-wise scale between groups on both hemispheres, considering age, disease duration, eTIV and LED (in PD groups) as covariates. The main effect of CTh difference was corrected using false discovery rate (FDR) correction at q\u2009=0.05. The cortical thickness value of regions with significant differences was then extracted for each participant. We used t-tests to accomplish comparisons of CTh between groups in FoG+ Vs HC, FoG- Vs HC and FoG+ Vs FoG-, and one-way ANOVA for the contrast of BrainSegVolNotVent and eTIV. Statistical significance was defined as P\u2009<0.01. \n\nNext, correlation analyses were performed between CTh and clinical evaluation data for the FoG+ and FoG- groups, respectively, as well as all the PD subjects as a whole, with age and disease duration as covariates. \n\nWe also performed ROC analyses to evaluate the classification value of CTh to determine whether it could differentiate PD (FoG+ and FoG-) patients from HCs or the FoG+ group from the FoG- group. The sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cut-off points were calculated. The standard of statistical significance were set as P\u2009<0.05 for the statistical analyses above. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Demographic Information \n  \nThe demographic and clinical assessments data for the 3 groups of participants are shown in  . There was no significant difference among the 3 groups for age, sex, or MMSE score. Regarding the two groups of PD patients, FoG+ patients had a longer average disease duration, larger medication dose measured by LED than the FoG- group, as well as higher UPDRS scores on parts II and IV. Patients with FoG also had distinctly higher scores on the FoG questionnaire than those without. \n\n\n### 3.2. Cortical Thickness and Volume-Based Results \n  \nOverall, we discovered cortical thickness reduction in the middle temporal gyrus of the right hemisphere (rMTG), which is located at MNI coordinates (50.6, 2.5, 33.0) ( ). As the result of the post hoc test for between-group comparisons, the CTh of the rMTG was thinner in the FoG+ group (P\u2009<0.01) and FoG- group (P\u2009<0.01) than in the HC group ( ). Meanwhile, we found that the CTh of the rMTG in FoG+ patients was to be thinner than that in FoG- patients, but the result was not statistically significant (P\u2009=0.42). There was no statistical difference in BrainSegVolNotVent (P\u2009=0.89) or eTIV (P\u2009=0.70) among the 3 groups. \n\n\n### 3.3. ROC Analysis \n  \nAs a result, the CTh of the rMTG could not effectively separate the FoG+ group from the FoG- group at statistically significant level (P\u2009=0.16). However, when taking the whole PD patients sample (FoG+ and FoG- groups) into consideration, we found that the CTh of the rMTG was able to differentiate patients with PD from healthy controls (AUC\u2009=0.79, P\u2009<0.01) and that the best cut-off point was reached when CTh\u2009=3.08\u2009mm, with a sensitivity of 80%, 95% CI: (0.75, 0.94) and specificity of 71%, 95% CI: (0.39, 0.76) ( ). \n\n\n### 3.4. Correlation between Clinical Stages \n  \nAfter correcting for the influence of age and disease duration, we discovered a negative correlation between the UPDRS part II score and the CTh of the rMTG (P\u2009<0.05) ( ). Meanwhile, a borderline significance was found in the correlation of rMTG CTh and FOGQ (R \u2009=\u20090.433; P\u2009=0.072). No significant correlation was established between the CTh of the rMTG and other clinical assessments of disease stages ( ). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we used a surface-based method to explore whole-brain cortical thickness in FoG+ and FoG- PD patients and healthy controls. As a result, a reduction in CTh was present in the rMTG among all PD patients compared with HC, and its value was negatively correlated with the UPDRS part II score. Additionally, ROC analysis showed that it may effectively separate patients with PD from HCs. \n\nThe possible relationship between middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and Parkinson's disease has been described in many previous studies. Gao et al. discovered CTh reduction in the middle temporal cortex along with the fusiform gyrus, insula of the left hemisphere and fusiform gyrus, isthmus cingulate cortex, inferior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex of the right hemisphere in PD patients, while the CTh of the left temporal pole was correlated with UPDRS-III scores. Yang et al. [ ] reported that significant increased activity was observed in the right middle temporal lobe in early PD. The role of the MTG in brain function has not yet been fully discovered, but a few functional and anatomical studies have provided important hints about its responsibility. Tractography-based analysis indicated that the middle temporal gyrus can be divided into 4 parts: 1) the anterior middle temporal gyrus (aMTG), 2) the middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (mMTG), 3) the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and 4) the sulcus of the middle temporal gyrus (sMTG) [ ]. Respectively, the aMTG is a crucial part of the DMN while participates in language comprehension. The mMTG acts as an important hub in the formation of semantic memory and retrieval of social knowledge. The pMTG takes part in language processing, being indispensable when people read or repeat tasks, while the sMTG helps to perceive social attention cues from others, including body posture, head position or eye gaze direction. This strongly supports results from quite a few studies indicating that cognitive impairment in PD significantly correlates with degeneration or deactivation of the MTG [ \u2013 ]. \n\nA neural tracing experiment using an injected tracer in the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) of macaques showed that the MTG has additional connectivity with the AIP, indicating that it also plays an important role in object recognition by connecting the ventral visual stream with the hand motor system [ ]. In our study, the UPDRS part II score was higher in PD patients with FoG than in those without FoG, while negatively correlated with the CTh of the rMTG. This part of score evaluated disease stage by evidence including the use of tableware, dressing, and daily hygiene, which obviously involve object recognition and operation, as well as retrieval of language messages. Therefore, our findings help to understand the deteriorated ability to perform daily activities in FoG+ patients from a different perspective. \n\nAlthough the mechanism behind FoG has yet to be fully understood, researchers have already made a number of plausible hypotheses about its origin. One of the most widely accepted models attributes FoG to the disturbance of the motor system in charge of balance and locomotion [ ]. But, in fact, the motor network is very intricate, with a wide range of connections to various functional regions of the brain. Afferent feedback from sensory systems, along with attentional and emotional network status, could exert a significant influence on the symptoms of FoG [ ]. Meanwhile, in clinical practice, symptoms of FoG+ patients can always be alleviated by giving auditory instructions and emotional cueing about proper steps [ ]. Pelosin et.al successfully improve motor performance of PD FoG patients with action observation training (AOT) [ ], indicating that retrieving semantic information may actually exert compensatory effect on the motor system. A previous fMRI study found that the left middle temporal and middle occipital gyri and the inferior, middle and superior frontal regions were activated almost exclusively in motor ideation, giving us additional evidence that degeneration of the MTG cortex may contribute to motor dysfunction in PD. However, out of our expectation, the final result did not provide significant evidence for aberrant cortical alteration at MTG specifically in FoG+ patients. We speculated several possible causes which might lead to such outcomes: 1. The sample size of our study is rather small, with merely 24 FoG+ participants and 37 FoG- ones. This would inevitably limit the statistical power in the analytical processes. 2. Studies pointed out that freezing of gait could be further categorized into 3 subtypes according to specific patterns of leg motion: (1) shuffling with small steps, (2) trembling in place, (3) complete akinesia [ ]. And there is already evidence about gray matter structural alteration between motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (not freezing of gaits) [ ]. However, our study only considered the situation as \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d status of FoG, possibly covering the existing differences between the 3 subtypes. 3. Although the effect of medication dose (measured by LED) was controlled in the statistical processes, application of levodopa is still likely to shape brain networks in structural and functional levels under long-term effect [ ,  ]. In this study, average LED of FoG positive group was larger than those negative ones, which might implicate medication effect on cortical structural changes. However, due to longer disease duration and more severe symptom, FoG positive PD patients are always to be treated with higher accumulative dosage of medication, which constitute the difficulty to find dosage-matched participants. 4. Additionally, differences in detail of image data processing and analyzing, such as standard of quality control and proper parameters setting according to data characteristic, may also contribute to the discrepancy. Therefore, future research will be necessary to advance our exploration with adequate sample size under similar medication dosage among more specific FoG subtypes, as well as more controlled processes in data analysis. \n\nIn quantitative morphometric brain studies, the results can always be influenced by head size variation between participants. In one volume-based study concerning idiopathic PD, differences in the volume of brain regions were altered significantly before and after controlling for total intracranial volume (TICV) [ ]. In FreeSurfer, total intracranial volume is represented by an automated calculated parameter deduced from the Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF), aka estimatedEstimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) [ ]. The results showed no difference presented in BrainSegVolNotVent and eTIV between groups in our study, indicating that data from different groups were comparable without correction of whole brain volume. \n\nOur study still has many limitations. Firstly, as mentioned before, our sample size is rather small, which is one of the main drawbacks of this study. This is partially due to our requirement for matched participants and the relatively short duration of the study. Secondly, using CTh of rMTG as a biomarker for PD should be resample by replication groups. Due to the small sample size of our study, we were unable to accomplish this procedure. Thirdly, all of our participants were right-handed. This may cause bias in laterality in our results. Therefore, our results should be resampled in future research with a larger population and participants with both handedness. Moreover, researchers may focus on exploring the intrinsic relationship between the semantic system and freezing of gait from different perspectives, such as fMRI and DTI, and try to understand how the visual-motor system and semantic system are interwoven. \n\nIn summary, we explored possible neural degeneration in PD patients with FoG using the cortical thickness method. We discovered that the CTh of the rMTG is thinner in Parkinson's disease patients than in HC, while it is negative correlated with the UPDRS part II score, and correlation was borderline-significant between FOGQ and rMTG CTh. However, the difference of CTh was not significant between FoG+ and FoG- PD subjects in our study. Additionally, the CTh of the rMTG could effectively differentiate PD subjects from HC, but not FoG positive patients from those negative ones. We speculate that degeneration of brain regions in charge of the semantic control system may participate in the presence of motor disabilities in PD. Further researches may try to validate our findings with more substantial sample size, as well as to determine the relationship between semantic control and the visual-motor system following cues from our study. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7735855, "text_md5": "711df560fd6060c0aaa1666dd13fed93", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 89], "journal": [90, 102], "publication_year": [104, 108], "title": [119, 211], "keywords": [225, 225], "abstract": [238, 1966], "body": [1975, 23727]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33354205, "doi": "10.1155/2020/8874119", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735855", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7735855"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735855\">7735855</a>", "list_title": "PMC7735855  Exploring Cortical Thickness Alteration in Parkinson Disease Patients with Freezing of Gaits"}

Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer disease.  It has been reported that such disorders have a late onset and may affect approximately 1% of the population >65 years old,  and 4% of people aged >80 years.  Its incidence rates range from 8 to 18 per 100,000 persons annually,  with a prevalence rate of 19.9/100,000 persons in men and 9.9/100,000 persons in females.  Epidemiological studies have reported that most patients with PD (approximately 90%) have sporadic (90%) or late-onset PD.  Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with PD have early onset  and commonly occur in familial clusters. \n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on PD, and neuroimaging biomarkers (NMBM) have attracted extensive attention from researchers. These studies involved NMBM, such as dopamine Positron Emission Tomography/Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography,  nondopamine imaging (serotonin and cholinergic imaging,  metabolic and cerebral blood flow network neuroimaging ), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (diffusion-weighted imaging,  neuromelanin-sensitive imaging,  iron-sensitive imaging,  and T1 weighted imaging ). Currently, an increasing number of studies have investigated imaging biomarkers of PD,  and few studies have analyzed and summarized the research hotspots and trends in NMBM in PD. \n\nCiteSpace is a Java-based computer programming language explored by Professor Meichao Chen at Drexel University in the United States, which conducts bibliometric analyses of the literature in specific research fields.  It has been utilized to identify core researchers, institutions, countries/regions, keyword bursts, citation reference bursts, and their collaborative relationships, presenting research trends and hotspots through co-citation.  Based on the relevant PD literature of NMBM in the Web of Science (WOS) core collection database, a knowledge map was drawn using the CiteSpace software. This study aimed to explore the research status, hotspots, and trends of NMBM in PD over the past 2 decades and provide a reference for international research in the present field. \n\n\n## 2.

Analysis tool \n  \nMicrosoft Excel 97 was used to calculate the number of publications annually. The CiteSpace software (6.1R2) tool was used to construct, analyze, and visualize bibliometric maps.  Our analysis included countries/regions, institutions, authors, keywords, co-citations of literature and journals, and bibliometric analysis. The nodes in each atlas represent the corresponding countries, institutions, authors, keywords, co-cited literature, co-cited journals, etc. The connections between nodes represent the cooperation of countries/regions, institutions, authors, co-occurrence of keywords, and co-citation of literature and journals. CiteSpace identifies parts of mediation centricity, with high mediation centricity representing turning points in the field. The parameters of CiteSpace were set as follows: time Slicin: 1998 to 2022, years per slice (1); text processing: term source (title, abstract, author keywords, keywords plus), term type, links and selection criteria, node type (country, institution, author, keyword, reference, cited journal), pruning (pathfinder, pruning sliced networks, and pruning the merged network).

A bibliometric analysis of NMBM in PD research from 1998 to 2022 was conducted. It summarizes the general information, research hotspots, and trends of NMBM in PD. \n\n### 4.1. General information for NMBM of PD research \n  \nAs can be seen from the annual publications about NMBM in PD, its development is categorized into 3 stages in this field: \n  \nonly 0 to 2 studies were published from 1998 to 2005, which indicated a preliminary investigation of NMBM for evaluating PD; \n  \nthe number of publications increased steadily from 2006 to 2014. The total number of studies showed an increasing trend, with an annual average number of 14.33; \n  \nthere were a number of explosive publications (annual publications of 39.83) from 2015 to 2021, which indicated that the research on NMBM in PD entered into a period of rapid development in this domain. \n  \nAnalyzing the collaborative network among countries, institutions, and authors, it was concluded that the United States had the highest centrality, earliest research, and most publications in the field of NMBM in PD. This shows that the United States has the greatest influence in this field. The major institutions are the University of Pennsylvania, Institute of Neurodegenerative Disorders, Emory University, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, University of Washington, and Harvard University. \n\nThe authors are David Eidelberg and Yilong Ma from the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Jing Zhang from the University of Washington, and John Q. Trojanowski from the University of Pennsylvania. David Eidelberg, whose research focused on the association between brain metabolism and blood flow in PD,  primarily investigated the expression of metabolic brain networks in PD using the 18F-FDG-PET image reconstruction algorithm.  The second-highest publication country is the United Kingdom, with the representative institution of King\u2019s College London. The third-largest country is China, with the representative institution of Fudan University. Countries, institutions, and authors all have certain collaborations with each other. However, there is less cooperation among countries but closer collaboration among authors within national institutions. Thus, it is important to establish long-term and stable collaborations among authors and institutions across international countries, which is beneficial for further development of NMBM in PD in this field. \n\nThe top published journal is   Movement Disorders   and the top-cited journal is   Neurology  . The research fields of both journals are clinical neurology, and both are Q1 journals, which have a high academic status and international influence, indicating that the research quality of NMBM in PD is high. In addition, publishing in high-quality journals contributes to the cooperation and exchange of scholars across different regions. \n\n\n### 4.2. Research hotspots and trends of NMBM in PD \n  \nThis study discusses the hotspots and trends of NMBM in PD from the aspects of co-citation references, co-occurrence, cluster, and bursts of keywords. Keyword co-occurrence and clusters indicate hot topics in this field, and keyword bursts may suggest frontier topics or emerging trends in this field.  We can obtain research results with high attention in this field through an analysis of publications with high citation frequency and centrality, which reveals the focus areas of scholars. \n\nThis study analyzed the co-occurrence and cluster of keywords to understand the research focus of NMBM in PD. The high-frequency keywords were Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and substantia nigra, but not all of them had high centrality, which often reflects the turning point of the map of keyword frequency. The keywords with high centrality were cerebrospinal fluid, alpha-synuclein, cerebral blood flow, beta, and diagnosis, which play an effective role in supporting the research network in this field. Of those, dementia was the high-frequency keyword with centrality of 0.17 (>0.1). Along with cerebrospinal fluid, alpha synuclein, cerebral blood flow, beta, and diagnosis are hot topics in this research field. \n\nThis study explored the research trends in NMBM in PD, in accordance with the literature on co-cited references and keyword bursts in this field. The top 8 strongest citation bursts of keywords were differential diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, Lewy body, voxel-based morphometry, biomarkers, MRI, and disease. Among these, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging, and disease have been hotspots and trends of research since 2019. \n\nThis analysis consisted of the following aspects. First, it focuses on NMBM in PD, which provides a better understanding of PD through biomarkers, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of PD progression, and further improves its diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis. Current research methods for NMBM include T1-weighted MRI, dopaminergic Positron Emission Tomography/Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography, nondopaminergic PET, metabolic and network imaging, iron-sensitive MRI, free-water imaging, and neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. According to Kraemmer et al\u2019s  study, PET or SPECT presents abnormally only when a large number of dopaminergic neurons are lost in substantia nigra pars compacta, which is incredible in the differential diagnosis of atypical Parkinson syndrome.  T1-weighted MRI with voxel-based morphometry has some advantages in differentiating PD from atypical Parkinson syndrome.  However, there are limitations to using different NMBM. Bougea  suggested that a combination of multiple biomarkers can improve the early diagnosis and more accurate prognosis of PD. Thus, exploring more valuable NMBM remains a focus in this field. \n\nSecond, it focuses on disease research. With further study of NMBM in pathology, studies have reported the key pathological features of PD as the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta,  \u03b1-synuclein insolubilization, and aggregation of Lewy bodies and intracellular inclusions in Louie neurites,  SNCA,  LRRK2,  VPS35,  EIF4G1,  DNAJC13,  and CHCHD2  gene mutation. It is still difficult to differentiate cognitive impairment in patients with PD from that in those with dementia or Alzheimer disease. Manuel Delgado-Alvarado summarized the potential biomarkers of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in patients with PD over the past 25 years, and concluded decreased cholinergic innervation and metabolism in the posterior midbrain region by PET and hippocampal atrophy on MRI. The results indicate that there may be dementia or dementia risk, suggesting a longitudinal study combining existing techniques and new methods to identify dementia risk in PD.  In February 2018, Hanna-Pladdy conducted a 5-year prospective longitudinal cohort study of biomarkers to predict cognitive progress in patients with PD. This study established a combination of cognitive and fMRI methods for the early recognition of cognitive progression risks and for the use of graph theory analysis to establish phenotypes of PD connectives.  It is also used to establish predictive models, fMRI biomarkers, and to explore PD cognitive impairment and common clinical dementia as the research frontiers in this field. \n\nThird, previous studies have focused on neuroimaging technology. With the development of artificial intelligence, the recognition of neural and mental NMBM by the support vector machine (SVM) has become a current research hotspot and trend. Some scholars have applied the computer-aided classification technology of the SVM learning model to distinguish patients with PD, and have obtained better classification efficiency and coincidence rate of clinical diagnosis. SVM has become a new assessment tool for PD instead of clinical manual evaluation, and has become a classification technique for subtypes of PD.  Artificial intelligence combines big data, classifiers, SVM, and machine learning to build models for the early assessment of PD cognition. In addition to the differential diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia have become frontier topics of current research. \n\n\n\n## 5. Limitation \n  \nA bibliometric analysis of publications on NMBM in PD using CiteSpace was conducted in this study. We only analyzed publications from the WOS core collection because of the limitation of the CiteSpace software, and only English publications were analyzed, which may have resulted in incomprehensive literature sources. In addition, CiteSpace is simply a network of visualization and analysis, and the diseases covered by the study need to be considered in future analyses. \n\n\n## 6. Conclusion \n  \nThis study summarizes the general information, research hotspots, and trends in NMBM in PD. The current research status shows that the study of NMBM in PD develops rapidly, which indicates that collaborations among scholars, institutions, and countries need to be enhanced. The research hotspots and trends are to explore new NMBM and artificial intelligence medical imaging for the early prediction, clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment evaluation of PD. The most frequently studied disorder is cognitive impairment in PD. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Li-na Cai, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Wei-wei Zhao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Data curation:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Li-na Cai, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Wei-wei Zhao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Formal analysis:   Rui-xue Gao. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Qinhong Zhang, Xiao-ling Li. \n\n Investigation:   Jinhuan Yue, Qinhong Zhang. \n\n Methodology:   Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Wei-wei Zhao. \n\n Project administration:   Jinhuan Yue, Qinhong Zhang. \n\n Resources:   Li-na Cai, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Software:   Rui-xue Gao, Yang Wang. \n\n Supervision:   Jinhuan Yue, Qinhong Zhang. \n\n Validation:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Li-na Cai, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Wei-wei Zhao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Visualization:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Li-na Cai, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Wei-wei Zhao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Ang Li, Jinhuan Yue, Li-na Cai, Qinhong Zhang, Rui-xue Gao, Sheng-lan Gao, Wei-wei Zhao, Xiao-ling Li, Yang Wang. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9388009, "text_md5": "159d9648e2f295900cf5df82dba9c7c4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 145], "journal": [146, 166], "publication_year": [168, 172], "title": [183, 278], "keywords": [292, 390], "abstract": [403, 1854], "body": [1863, 29126]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35984119, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000030079", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9388009", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9388009"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9388009\">9388009</a>", "list_title": "PMC9388009  A bibliometric analysis of neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson disease based on Web of Science"}

Complex gait tasks such as turning typically elicit freezing more commonly than simple gait tasks, such as forward walking. Despite the frequency of this debilitating and dangerous symptom, the brain mechanisms underlying freezing remain unclear. Gait imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging permits investigation of brain activity associated with locomotion. We used this approach to better understand neural function during gait-like tasks in people with Parkinson disease who experience freezing- \u201cFoG+\u201d and people who do not experience freezing- \u201dFoG\u2212\u201c. Nine FoG+ and nine FoG\u2212 imagined complex gait tasks (turning, backward walking), simple gait tasks (forward walking), and quiet standing during measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Changes in BOLD signal (i.e. beta weights) during imagined walking and imagined standing were analyzed across FoG+ and FoG\u2212 groups in locomotor brain regions including supplementary motor area, globus pallidus, putamen, mesencephalic locomotor region, and cerebellar locomotor region. Beta weights in locomotor regions did not differ for complex tasks compared to simple tasks in either group. Across imagined gait tasks, FoG+ demonstrated significantly lower beta weights in the right globus pallidus with respect to FoG\u2212. FoG+ also showed trends toward lower beta weights in other right-hemisphere locomotor regions (supplementary motor area, mesencephalic locomotor region). Finally, during imagined stand, FoG+ exhibited lower beta weights in the cerebellar locomotor region with respect to FoG\u2212. These data support previous results suggesting FoG+ exhibit dysfunction in a number of cortical and subcortical regions, possibly with asymmetric dysfunction towards the right hemisphere. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGait dysfunction is common in Parkinson disease (PD), and includes short steps  , increased step time variability  , and poor step-to-step coordination  . Furthermore, about 50% of people with advanced PD also experience Freezing of Gait (FoG)  ,  , defined as a transient inability to complete effective stepping  . FoG is a disabling and distressing symptom, contributing to falls and reduced quality of life  ,  \u2013 , and common PD treatments such as anti-Parkinson medication do not consistently provide adequate benefit  . Although FoG is transient, people who experience freezing (FoG+) may exhibit altered gait even during normal walking (i.e. periods of non-freezing or festination), suggesting that the underlying pathophysiology also affects non-freezing locomotion  ,  ,  . \n\nThe neural underpinnings of freezing of gait remain unknown. Two recent reports used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain activity in FoG+ during gait-like tasks  ,  . These reports showed FoG+ to exhibit altered activity in the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) compared to people who do not freeze (FoG\u2212) during gait imagery  , and during lower limb motor blocks  . Together, these results support the notion that altered activity in brainstem regions may relate to freezing of gait. In addition, Shine and colleagues also showed reduced activity in the globus pallidus, putamen, and several cortical areas during motor arrests in FoG+. These studies, along with many others  ,  \u2013 , have shown the efficacy of using gait-like tasks, including gait imagery, to assess locomotor dysfunction. This technique relies on the substantial overlap in brain activation responses during imagined and overt movements  \u2013  including walking  ,  . Despite limitations, this approach has provided important insight into brain activation during locomotion in humans  ,  ,  . \n\nPrevious gait imagery tasks used to compare FoG+ and FoG\u2212 focused on imagined forward walking. However, more complex gait tasks such as turning increase freezing risk and gait dysfunction  ,  ,  ,  . Therefore, brain dysfunction in those who freeze may be more pronounced during these tasks than during forward walking. The underlying mechanisms of increased dysfunction during complex gait are not well understood, yet asymmetry and reduced coordination of steps during complex gait tasks, such as turning, may precipitate freezing  . Turning necessitates asymmetries in step length and leg velocity  , and leads to discoordinated stepping in people with PD. Further, turning by walking in large rather than small circles provides a clinical strategy to improve coordination and reduce freezing  ,  . Together, these data suggest the possibility that increased freezing during complex gait tasks such as turning may be due to the inherent asymmetry and discoordination present during these movements. \n\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate differences in brain activity in FoG+ and FoG\u2212 during simple and complex gait tasks. We measured BOLD response during imagery of simple (forward) and complex (backward walking, turning) gait, as well as imagined standing in FoG+ and FoG\u2212. We hypothesized that FoG+ would have altered BOLD responses with respect to FoG\u2212 during imagined gait tasks in the following locomotor regions of interest (ROIs): supplementary motor area (SMA), globus pallidus (GP), putamen, MLR, and cerebellar locomotor region (CLR). Further, we expected imagery of complex tasks (turning, backward walking) compared to forward walking would enhance these differences. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### 1 Ethics Statement \n  \nThis protocol was approved by the Washington University in St. Louis internal review board. Written informed consent was provided by all subjects in accordance with the Human Research Protection Office and the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### 2 Participants \n  \nInclusion criteria included diagnosis of idiopathic PD as described by Racette et al.   and based on established criteria  , no lower limb injuries for the previous 6 months, no contraindications for MRI, and ability to effectively imagine movement based on the Kinesthetic Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ)  . Thirty three individuals were screened, and those with an average score less than 3 on either the kinesthetic or visual component of the KVIQ, indicating moderate clarity and intensity of imagery, were excluded. Seven individuals with PD were excluded (no fMRI data were collected) based on this imagery vividness threshold. All participants also completed the Gait Imagery Questionnaire   (GIQ) to permit post-hoc comparisons of ability to imagine gait across groups, though this score was not used to exclude participants ( ). Exclusion criteria included neurological problems other than PD and cognitive dysfunction (Mini Mental State Exam; MMSE<27). \n   Participant characteristics.        \nIndividuals were classified as those who experience freezing \u201cFoG+\u201d, and those who do not experience freezing \u201cFoG\u2212\u201d using the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ)  . People who identified themselves as FoG+ in question 1 went on to answer 8 questions assessing the severity of freezing and its effects on daily life. All data collection was conducted after a 12-hour withdrawal of anti-Parkinson medication. FoG+ and FoG\u2212 were matched as closely as possible for disease severity level. Motor severity was assessed by the motor subscale of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS part III). \n\n\n### 3 Procedure \n  \nParticipants were first trained to complete five overground tasks: forward walking, backward walking, turning to the left and right in small radius (r\u200a=\u200a0.6 m) circles, and standing quietly. Participants were instructed to walk at a natural, comfortable speed for each task. Participant completed each task at two different distances (4 and 8 m for forward and backward gait; 2 and 3 revolutions for turning). The time necessary to complete each gait task was recorded. Training lasted approximately 20 minutes, in which participants completed each task a minimum of 2 times. Participants also practiced imagining each task. \n\nParticipants then completed two T2*-weighted gradient echo multislice sequence scans (EPI, TR\u200a=\u200a2200 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3 ms, 4.0 mm  voxels, FA\u200a=\u200a90\u00b0, 9:45 min). BOLD signal was captured for 36 slices covering the brain and the cerebellum. A T1-weighted sagittal, magnetization prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE, TR\u200a=\u200a2400 ms, TI\u200a=\u200a1000 ms, TE\u200a=\u200a3.16 ms, FA\u200a=\u200a8\u00b0, 1.0 mm , 8:09 min) scan was also collected for identification of ROIs and co-registration of the T2* scans. MR was done with a Siemens 3T Magnetom TrioTim scanner. After the fMRI scans, participants underwent an informal exit interview in which they were asked if they experienced any freezing episodes during any imagery bouts. \n\nDuring BOLD acquisition scans, participants imagined the same walking tasks (forward walking, backward walking, turning to the left, and turning to the right) as practiced overground. For each task, participants imagined walking two distances (4 and 8 meters for forward and backward gait; 2 and 3 revolutions for turns). Gait imagery tasks were completed with eyes closed and in a pseudo-random order. Each imagined gait bout was separated by an 11-second rest period in which eyes were open. It was necessary to have individuals open their eyes during rest to permit them to detect the visual cue of the upcoming task. In addition, monitoring when eyes were open and closed (via an MR compatible eye-tracker) provided another measure of adherence to the task. In a small number of runs, participants opened their eyes at inappropriate times. When this occurred, we stopped the scan, repeated the instructions, and started the scan anew. Inclusion of the eyes open rest tasks may have altered the baseline BOLD signal during fMRI runs. However, the same rest tasks were included for all runs (i.e. imagined standing and imagined gait) and for both groups. During gait imagery, participants tapped their index finger on a custom made MRI compatible button box (Mag Design and Engineering, Redwood City, CA, USA) once at the beginning and once at the end of each gait task to log the start and finish of each imagery epoch ( ). Timing of each button press was recorded and used for post hoc assessment of imagery times and event related design modeling. By measuring the time taken to imagine walking short and long distances, we could assess the degree to which participants adhered to the tasks during scans. Participants were instructed to imagine in a first person perspective, and not to count steps. \n   Gait imagery task.  \nAfter reading the cue, the participant closes his eyes, pushes a button, and begins imagining. At the completion of gait imagery, he again presses the button and opens his eyes. \n  \nIn a third, four minute long T2*-weighted scan, participants alternated between imagined upright standing (20 seconds) and rest (11 seconds). For this scan a tactile cue on the leg indicated the end of imagery. Tactile cues were used during imagined standing for logistical reasons. During imagined gait, participants' imagery times were self-selected (i.e. they stopped imagining and opened eyes after completing the gait task). During imagined standing, however, it was necessary to notify the participant when to stop imagining. The tactile cue was modeled into the GLM to account for any associated changes in BOLD signal. Participants' eyes were closed during imagery of standing and open during rest, analogous to the imagined gait task. Thus, all imagery (imagined gait and imagined standing) was conducted with eyes closed. \n\nStimuli were projected onto a screen behind the participant and were viewed via a mirror mounted on the head coil. Instructions were presented using E-Prime v1.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Inc, Sharpsburg, PA). An MRI-compatible eye tracker documented that the eyes were closed and open at appropriate times. Presence of tremor of the eyes, head, lower legs and hands during scans was assessed qualitatively by observation. Two participants were excluded due to tremor during the scans (See Results). \n\n\n### 4 FMR pre-processing \n  \nFunctional data were preprocessed using Brain Voyager (v. 2.4.0.2000, 32-bit). The first two volumes from each imaging run were discarded for all trials. 3D motion correction was completed via sinc-interpolation. Slice scan time differences were corrected via sinc interpolation, and data were high pass filtered (the lowest two cycles were removed). Functional scans were then coregistered (i.e. spatially aligned) to participant-specific T1-weighted images which were normalized to Talairach space  . Task conditions were modeled with an event-related design with event length equal to the time taken to imagine that particular task and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, which accounts for the delayed cerebral blood oxygenation changes following changes in neuronal activity. In addition to the 3D motion correction, any scan in which more than 2 mm or 2\u00b0 of motion in any direction was detected was not included in the analysis. Neither maximum head movement (p\u200a=\u200a0.56), nor standard deviation of head movement (p\u200a=\u200a0.91) during scans differed between groups. \n\n\n### 5 Region of interest (ROI) analysis \n  \nBOLD signal was analyzed only within a-priori ROIs. We chose this approach for three reasons. First, ROIs can be identified manually on each participant more precisely than using a standardized template. Participant-specific region identification is particularly important for investigations into activity of small target regions. Second, a-priori identification of ROIs limits the need for multiple comparisons with respect to whole-brain analyses. Finally, the a priori selection of ROIs allow for a hypothesis driven approach to understanding locomotor dysfunction in PD. We chose nine ROIs (bilateral SMA, bilateral putamen, bilateral GP, bilateral MLR, and CLR) due to their link to both human locomotion  ,  \u2013  and dysfunction in individuals with PD  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ; particularly in people who experience freezing  ,  ,  ,  . Since our tasks of interest involved imagined movements, primary motor cortex was not included as a ROI, as this area does not typically responded to imagined motor tasks  ,  ,  . ROIs were identified manually for each participant on a high resolution MP-RAGE image warped to Talairach space  . A single operator, blinded to BOLD activation and group status, identified all ROIs. The SMA was identified as the midline grey matter superior to the cingulate sulcus. Parallel vertical lines through the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior commissure (PC) marked rostral and caudal boundaries  . The MLR was identified as a 54-voxel region of the brainstem lateral to the cerebellar peduncle decussation and medial lemniscus, including approximately the cuneate, subcuneate and pedunculopontine (PPN) nuclei  ,  . Rostral and caudal borders were based on previously defined borders of the PPN  \u2013 , The rostral border was defined at the intercollicular level  , with the caudal border lying 6 mm inferior from this point, similar to Zrinzo and colleagues  . Because brainstem structures are difficult to identify on T1 scans, it is possible that the region identified excluded parts of the MLR or PPN, or included portions of other regions. However region identification was consistent across all subjects (both in location and size). The CLR was identified as a 72-voxel region of the midline white matter of the cerebellum, approximately rostral to the fastigial nuclei  . This region was chosen because it was shown specifically to be active during locomotion in previous gait imagery experiments in humans  , and may be dysfunctional in those with PD  . Globus pallidus and putamen were identified using standard human atlases  ,  . Other non-motor regions (e.g. frontal and parietal areas) have been suggested to be related to freezing of gait (for review, see  ). We did not include additional non-motor regions in order to limit the total number of ROIs and the need for multiple comparison correction. Average Talairach coordinates of each region are provided in  , and examples of each ROI are shown in  . For comparison to other investigations, a non-linear transformation (mni2tal) was used to convert Montreal Neurologic Institute coordinates to Talairach coordinates ( ). \n   Regions of interest.  \nRegions were identified for each individual separately based on standard definitions (see Methods). Shown are examples of regions defined for four subjects: supplementary motor area (a), putamen and globus pallidus (b), cerebellar locomotor region (c), and mesencephalic locomotor region (d). A-Anterior; P-Posterior; R-Right; L-Left. \n     Mean (SD) of Talairach coordinates for each region of interest.      \n\n### 6 Statistics \n  \nAnalyses of variance (ANOVAs) assessed actual and imagined gait times in both groups. Pearson correlation statistics assessed the relationship between actual and imagined gait times. \n\nA general linear model (GLM) was constructed for imagined gait BOLD data to determine how well the design matrix model explains data. Beta weight changes associated with 5 tasks (rest, forward, backward, turning left, and turning right) and incorporating 6-dimensional head motion were determined using the GLM. Beta weights represent how much of the BOLD signal change is attributed to each of the five tasks. The inclusion of 6-dimensional head motion in the GLM helps to account for alterations in signal due to movements of the brain. Beta weights were also calculated for imagined stand and rest. Due to potential changes in baseline BOLD signals across scans, imagined stand and imagined gait beta weights were normalized to rest BOLD signals from their respective fMRI scans. This was completed by subtracting rest beta weights collected during the imagined gait scan from imagined gait beta weights. Similarly, rest beta weights collected during the imagined stand scan were subtracted from the imagined stand beta weights. Differences between imagined tasks (gait and stand) and rest in each group was carried out via paired sample, two-sided t-tests, and was conducted for each ROI. \n\nAnalyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to assess changes in beta weights during imagined gait across groups and across tasks for each ROI. To account for differences in motor severity across freezing and non-freezing groups, MDS-UPDRS-III was included as a covariate in the ANCOVA. Average gait imagery speed for each participant was also included as a covariate in the analysis. Spearman's \u03c1 statistics were used to correlate beta weights in each ROI to behavioral measures (actual overground gait velocity and freezing severity [NFOG total score]). Statistical threshold for all analyses was set at p\u200a=\u200a0.05. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### 1 Participants \n  \nfMRI data were collected from 26 participants with PD. Data from six participants were excluded due to head movement over 2 mm or 2\u00b0. Of these six, two also had severe hand tremor. Another individual was excluded because he later reported prior head trauma, and one individual was excluded due to poor imagery performance during the scan. Thus, 18 individuals with PD (nine FoG+ and nine FoG\u2212) were included for further analysis. FoG+ and FoG\u2212 were of similar age. FoG+ had similar disease severity to FoG\u2212 based on MDS-UPDRS part III and Hoehn and Yahr stage. Imagery ability (KVIQ and GIQ) was similar across groups ( ). \n\n\n### 2 Behavioral \n  \nActual overground walking times and gait imagery times were similar across groups (F \u200a=\u200a1.26; p\u200a=\u200a0.28 and F \u200a=\u200a1.4; p\u200a=\u200a0.25, respectively). No freezing events were reported during gait imagery via self-report. As expected, \u201clong\u201d gait imagery tasks took longer than \u201cshort\u201d (F \u200a=\u200a34.6; p<0.001,  ). Gait imagery times were not quite significantly longer than actual overground gait times, (p\u200a=\u200a0.053, paired sample t-test). Actual and imagined gait times correlated with each for all subjects (r\u200a=\u200a0.61, p\u200a=\u200a0.007,  ). One participant, a freezer, exhibited considerably longer imagery time (37 seconds on average) than actual time (18 seconds on average). Though no freezing was noted during imagery, this participant may have experienced altered imagined gait with respect to overground walking. Therefore, we completed BOLD signal analyses with and without this participant; no changes were noted. Furthermore, inclusion of imagined walking speed in the ANCOVA attenuated the effect of this outlier. Therefore, all data presented herein include this individual. \n   Gait imagery times in FoG\u2212 and FoG+ during short and long gait imagery tasks.  \n\u201cLong\u201d gait imagery tasks took significantly longer than \u201cshort\u201d gait imagery tasks (denoted by *, F \u200a=\u200a34.6; p<0.001, repeated measures ANOVA). Differences between FoG+ and FoG\u2212 did not reach significance. \n     Correlation between actual and imagined walking times for freezers and non-freezers.  \nCorrelation statistics represent all participants. \n  \n\n### 4 Functional MRI \n  \n#### Imagined Stand \n  \nDuring imagined standing, beta weights were significantly less than zero in the MLR (FoG+ and FoG\u2212), CLR (FoG\u2212), and GP (FoG\u2212), indicating a reduction in beta weights during imagined stand with respect to rest. In the FoG+ group, beta weights from the CLR were lower during imagined standing than in the FoG\u2212 group ( ). The Mini BESTest did not consistently correlate with beta weights during imagined stand. However, significant correlations were present between Mini BESTest and beta weights in the left and right putamen only in the FoG\u2212 group. \n   Beta weights during imagined standing, normalized to rest.        \n\n#### Imagined Gait \n  \nBeta weights while imagining turning to the left and to the right did not differ in either group. Therefore, we combined data from imagined left and right turns for subsequent analyses. In the FoG\u2212 group, beta weights, normalized to rest, were significantly greater than zero in several locomotor regions, including the SMA, putamen, and GP, indicating increases in activity during imagined gait with respect to rest. In the FoG+ group, no regions were more active during imagined walking, and beta weights in the right MLR were lower during imagined walking than rest ( ). Despite similar ability to imagine walking ( ) and similar gait imagery times ( ), a significant group effect was noted in the right GP, such that FoG+ exhibited smaller changes in signal than FoG\u2212 ( ). Trends toward significant group effects were noted in the right SMA and right MLR ( ,  ). No significant task or group by task interactions were observed. No consistent correlations were noted between beta weights during imagined walking and overground walking speeds. Of both groups, only the FoG+ group exhibited significant correlation of the right SMA beta weight with overground walking speed ( ). \n   Mean Beta weights (with respect to rest) for FoG- and FoG+ during imagined walking in the right GP.  \nA group effect, corrected for MDS-UPDRS and gait imagery speed, was noted such that FoG+ exhibited smaller BOLD signal than FoG- (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. \n     Mean beta weights (with respect to rest) for FoG\u2212 and FoG+ during imagined walking in the right SMA, right GP, and right MLR.  \nError bars represent standard error of the mean. *ANCOVA group differences after correcting for MDS-UPDRS and gait imagery speed. \n     Mean (SD) beta weights and p-values for imagined walking in FoG\u2212 and FoG+, normalized to rest.           Correlation (Spearman's Rho and p-value) between imagined walking beta weights and actual overground walking speed.        \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWith respect to FoG\u2212, FoG+ exhibited alterations in neural activity in the cerebellar locomotor region during imagined standing, and in the right GP during imagined walking. Other cortical and subcortical regions of the right side of the brain (MLR, SMA) also showed trends towards altered activity in FoG+ during imagined walking. \n\n### 1 Imagined standing \n  \nDuring imagined standing, activity in most locomotor regions were similar to rest. When differences were observed (e.g. in the MLR), BOLD signal was lower than during rest. This result is in contrast to previous literature  ,  , and is likely due to two differences in protocol. First, for both imagined standing and imagined gait bouts, participants had eyes closed during imagery, and open during rest periods, whereas previous investigations compared eyes closed imagined standing to eyes closed imagined lying. As noted above, we used this protocol to allow participants to read the text which informed their next task. In addition, by monitoring when participants' eyes were open and closed (via the eye tracker) we were able to gauge adherence to the task. Second, these previous studies were conducted on healthy young   and older   adults. Nonetheless, across group differences were noted in the CLR such that FoG\u2212 exhibited a larger change in BOLD signal than FoG+ between imagined standing and rest. Several recent reports have shown people with PD to have altered activity in the cerebellum with respect to healthy adults  , for review, see  . Further, individuals who experience freezing have also been shown to exhibit neural changes in the cerebellum with respect to FoG. For example, two recent reports found reduced structural connectivity (measured via diffusion tensor imaging; DTI) between the cerebellum and the PPN (a sub-region of the MLR) in FoG+ compared to FoG\u2212  ,  . These results, along with those of the current study suggest a possible relationship between cerebellar dysfunction and freezing. \n\n\n### 2 Imagined walking \n  \nDuring imagined walking, FoG- exhibited increased neural activity with respect to rest in several neural regions including the SMA, putamen, and GP. This is consistent with previous literature which also demonstrates activity in locomotor regions during a number of gait like tasks in PD including imagined gait  ,  ,  , actual gait  , and stepping in a virtual reality environment  . Interestingly, FoG+ generally showed less neural activity during imagined gait than FoG\u2212, despite having similar ability to imagine walking ( ) and similar gait imagery times ( ). The significant reduction in neural activity in the GP in FoG+ with respect to FoG\u2212 is also partially consistent with previous reports. Shine and colleagues measured BOLD signal during alternating foot tapping in an immersive virtual reality environment. Freezers tapped their feet to move forward through the environment, and, in some cases, demonstrated lower limb motor blocks. In this study, and similar to results of the current report, BOLD signal in the GP (as well as the STN) was lower during lower limb motor blocks with respect to periods of non-motor blocks when controlling for changes in cognitive load during VR stepping. \n\nWe also observed trends toward reduced activity in other subcortical (MLR) and cortical (SMA) regions on the right side of the brain. Albeit preliminary, these results are in conjunction with a recent report investigating structural connectivity in FoG+ and FoG\u2212 using DTI. Fling and colleagues showed that FoG+ may have altered structural connectivity between the PPN and cortical/subcortical regions, particularly on the right side of the brain  . Other reports have also suggested that FoG may be related to changes in connectivity on the right side of the brain  ,  . For example, Tessitore and colleagues (2012) demonstrated FoG+ to have altered functional connectivity of the executive-attention network with respect to FoG\u2212, particularly in the right hemisphere. \n\nOnly one previous report specifically investigated gait imagery in FoG+ and FoG\u2212  . In this report, and similar to the current findings, FoG+ exhibited a trend toward reduced activity in the SMA. However, Snijders and colleagues also observed   increased   activity in the MLR in those who freeze. The discrepancy between results of Snijders and colleagues and the current study with respect to direction of MLR BOLD changes across groups may be due in part to different analysis techniques. We used a ROI-based analysis, while Snijders et al. used full-brain random effects general linear model. There are pros and cons to each method. An ROI analysis allows for more precise identification of regions to test specific hypotheses. However, for the ROI-base analysis used in the current study, all voxels were averaged within a region (we assume homogeneity within each ROI) and therefore subtle signal changes in subregions within the ROI could be missed. The differing results in the MLR may also have to do with the region definitions across studies. The region of interest identified as the MLR in the current study was manually identified for each participant based on stereotactic analyses of the PPN  \u2013 , and was, on average, slightly rostral to the area of increased activity described by Snijders and colleagues. Specifically, the approximate median position, in Talairach coordinates, of the area of differential activation in Snijders et al. was x\u200a=\u200a0, y\u200a=\u200a\u221228, and z\u200a=\u200a\u221215  , whereas the midpoint of the MLR in the current study was x\u200a=\u200a+/\u22126, y\u200a=\u200a\u221226, z\u200a=\u200a\u221211. Though considerable effort has been put into identification of the MLR, and specifically the PPN, the precise location, identified via T1 weighted MRI, can be difficult to identify. Indeed, recent reports   have suggested the PPN may lie more caudal (approximate Talairach coordinates: x\u200a=\u200a+/\u22125, y\u200a=\u200a\u221229, z\u200a=\u200a\u221218) to the position noted in previous investigations  \u2013 . Additional research into consistent identification of this region is warranted. \n\n\n### 3 Complex Gait Imagery \n  \nComplex gait imagery tasks did not induce changes in beta weights with respect to simple gait imagery, despite the fact that actual gait is typically more dysfunctional in PD during complex tasks. Differences in actual and imagined locomotion may contribute to this finding. For example, imagined locomotion may require less balance and postural control than actual gait, limiting the differences in complexity across tasks. Despite these gait imagery limitations, Godde and colleagues showed a small increase in activity (14 voxels) in the left putamen during backward walking compared to forward walking, whereas we did not. Three factors may contribute to this discrepancy between studies. First, the previous report included a larger number of participants (n\u200a=\u200a51), increasing their power to detect subtle across-task differences. Second, they had participants practice and imagine tandem backward walking while on a treadmill, while we had participants walk normally overground. Tandem walking is more difficult than normal gait, particularly in older adults  , and may have led to a more pronounced BOLD signal change compared to imagined forward walking. Perhaps most importantly, they investigated healthy older adults, whereas we focused on people with PD, making direct comparisons across studies difficult  . \n\n\n### 4 Limitations \n  \nFunctional neuroimaging during gait imagery permits investigation of brain pathophysiology that underlies gait tasks. However, this approach has several limitations. Although actual and imagined gait tasks activate similar brain circuits  , inherent differences exist. Any task-related neuroimaging study depends upon accurate measurement and control of task performance. The covert nature of an imagined task makes this challenging. To ensure participants were able to effectively imagine movement, we screened for vividness of motor imagery (KVIQ score), and matched groups on ability to imagine both single limb movements (measured via the KVIQ), and imagined walking (measured via the GIQ). Furthermore, we obtained a measure of performance by comparing the length of time the participant imagined walking two different distances while in the scanner. Imagery times for longer distances were larger than short distances, suggesting participants were adhering to imagery tasks. This provided at least a rank order measure of performance of this covert task. Imagination of freezing during the imagery task also could confound task performance. However, no participants reported freezing events during gait imagery. Despite these various approaches to control imagery performance, we included imagined walking speed as a covariate in statistical analyses when comparing across groups as imagined walking at different speeds does alter BOLD responses  ,  ,  . FoG+ often have greater cognitive impairments than FoG\u2212  ,  . To minimize this potential confound, we applied strict cognitive screening criteria for all participants (MMSE score had to exceed 26/30), and we matched FoG+ and FoG\u2212 on this measure. Differences in motor severity between FoG+ and FoG\u2212 also could be a confound. Therefore, we included MDS-UPDRS part III scores as a covariate in statistical analyses contrasting groups. Our relatively small sample size, limited in part to the strict cognitive and imagery screening, may have reduced our power to detect more modest changes in BOLD responses in some regions. Nevertheless, we had adequate power to detect changes in BOLD signal across groups in both the GP (during imagined walking), and in the CLR (during imagined standing). Finally, the lack of a healthy control group somewhat limits the interpretation of this study, as we cannot determine whether alterations in activity in FoG+ across tasks are similar to healthy adults. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIndividuals with PD who freeze exhibited altered activity in the cerebellum (during imagined stand), and in several regions of the right hemisphere (during imagined walking). These findings suggests those who freeze demonstrate distributed neural dysfunction, which may be more pronounced in the right hemisphere. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3940915, "text_md5": "90b69038ec6207f2aade0ca008533418", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 113], "publication_year": [115, 119], "title": [130, 212], "keywords": [226, 226], "abstract": [239, 2153], "body": [2162, 34228]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24595265, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0090634", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940915", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3940915"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940915\">3940915</a>", "list_title": "PMC3940915  Gait-Related Brain Activity in People with Parkinson Disease with Freezing of Gait"}

However, postmortem evidence indicates that the pathology of lower brainstem regions, such as the pons and medulla, precedes nigral involvement. Consistently, pontomedullary damage was implicated by structural and PET imaging in early PD. Neurochemical correlates of this early pathological involvement in PD are unknown. \n\n\n## Methodology/Principal Finding \n  \nTo map biochemical alterations in the brains of individuals with mild-moderate PD we quantified neurochemical profiles of the pons, putamen and substantia nigra by 7 tesla (T) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thirteen individuals with idiopathic PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage 2) and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers participated in the study. \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the pons and putamen were significantly higher in patients (N\u200a=\u200a11, off medications) than controls (N\u200a=\u200a11, p<0.001 for pons and p<0.05 for putamen). The GABA elevation was more pronounced in the pons (64%) than in the putamen (32%). No other neurochemical differences were observed between patients and controls. \n\n\n## Conclusion/Significance \n  \nThe GABA elevation in the putamen is consistent with prior postmortem findings in patients with PD, as well as with in vivo observations in a rodent model of PD, while the GABA finding in the pons is novel. The more significant GABA elevation in the pons relative to the putamen is consistent with earlier pathological involvement of the lower brainstem. This study provides in vivo evidence for an alteration in the GABAergic tone in the lower brainstem and striatum in early-moderate PD, which may underlie disease pathogenesis and may provide a biomarker for disease staging. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by varying combinations of rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural changes. The major pathologic marker of PD is the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons which leads to a reduction in dopamine (DA) content within the striatum  . While loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons represents a hallmark of PD, the pathological involvement in PD is not restricted to these neurons. Thus, recent evidence indicates that caudal brainstem structures are involved in PD pathology even before the nigrostriatal pathology  . Several neuropathological studies have reported the degeneration in non-dopaminergic pathways, including serotonin   and noradrenaline neurons of the pons  . In line with these postmortem findings, the locus coeruleus (LC) of the pons was reported as the most affected extrastriatal area in PD with reduction of  F-dopa uptake, which is thought to reflect the degeneration of neurons in this structure  ,  . In addition, recent studies of patients with early PD revealed pontomedullary atrophy by voxel based morphometry   and decreased T  in the pontomesencephalic junction, indicating neuronal loss in this area  . \n\nMotivated by these histological, positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI findings indicative of early functional and structural changes in PD, we sought to gain further insights into biochemical alterations in this disease that are thought to precede structural changes. We utilized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H MRS) that can non-invasively monitor alterations in neurochemical levels and has been used to study neurochemical alterations in PD with some success  ,  ,  . Most prior MRS investigations in PD reported few neurochemicals or their ratios, such as the N-acetylaspartate-to-creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio, measured at 1.5 tesla (T) or 3T. For example, only one prior study investigated pontine neurochemistry in PD during life and reported no difference in the NAA/Cr ratio at 3T between subjects with PD and controls  . MRS findings in nigrostriatal structures were variable, most of them reporting no differences in PD vs. controls  ,  ,  ,  ,  . On the other hand, MRS studies of animal models of PD at higher magnetic fields found alterations in several metabolites such as the neurotransmitters glutamate (Glu) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)  ,  . If similar alterations in neurotransmitter systems are detectable in patients, they could lead to increased understanding of PD pathogenesis and serve as markers of progressive neuronal dysfunction. \n\nChallenges associated with MRS in deep brain nuclei in humans include their location, small size and high iron content  . High- and ultra-high field MRS in humans presents additional challenges including short T  values and limitations on the maximum achievable transmit power. Therefore, while the feasibility of quantifying \u201cneurochemical profiles\u201d in the human brain at the ultra-high field of 7T was demonstrated previously  ,  , such studies have primarily been restricted to superficial volumes-of-interest (VOIs) in the occipital lobe. A recent study demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying six metabolites by 7T MRS in deep brain regions from clinical populations  . Subsequently, we overcame challenges associated with quantifying neurochemical profiles of up to 15 metabolites from deep brain regions at 7T, including those that are of interest for PD pathology, such as the pons, the substantia nigra (SN) and the putamen  . Therefore, the goal of the current study was to investigate neurochemical alterations in these regions that are thought to be progressively involved in PD pathology with MRS at 7T and specifically to determine if alterations in neurotransmitter levels similar to those observed in animal models of PD would be detectable in patients with mild-moderate PD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThirteen individuals with mild\u2013moderate PD (6 women and 7 men, 56\u00b110 years old, mean\u00b1SD) and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers (7 women and 5 men, 54\u00b18 years old) participated in the study after giving written informed consent using procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board: Human Subjects Committee of the University of Minnesota. Participants were not demented (as assessed by the Mini Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and mild-moderate disease severity of patients was established with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr Staging (H&Y) ( ). Patients with PD were off their usual antiparkinsonian medications for 12 hours prior to imaging. \n   Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with PD and control subjects and spectral quality measures.        \n\n### MR Protocol \n  \nMR experiments were performed using a 7T, 90-cm horizontal bore magnet (Magnex) equipped with a Siemens console. A 16-channel transmit/receive transmission line array head coil was used  . Images acquired with a 1-mm isotropic resolution MPRAGE sequence (repetition time TR\u200a=\u200a3 s, inversion time TI\u200a=\u200a1.5 s, echo time TE\u200a=\u200a3.67 ms, 192 partition-encode steps, 256 phase-encode steps, 256 data points in the read direction, nominal flip angle\u200a=\u200a6\u00b0, total acquisition time\u200a=\u200a6 min 58 s) were used for the selection of the pons and putamen VOIs. Images acquired with a transverse multislice turbo spin echo sequence (field of view, 180\u00d7180 mm ; TR\u200a=\u200a3 s; TE\u200a=\u200a93 ms; flip angle\u200a=\u200a150\u00b0; slice thickness\u200a=\u200a3 mm; 48 slices; one average) were used to select the SN VOI. Destructive B  interferences in the VOI were reduced by localized B  shimming as described before  . Spectra were measured with a short-echo stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence (TE\u200a=\u200a8 ms, TR\u200a=\u200a5 s, mixing time TM\u200a=\u200a32 ms) with variable power RF pulses with optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR) water suppression and outer volume saturation  ,  . Spectra were acquired from posterior pons (30\u00d710\u00d715 mm , number of transients NT\u200a=\u200a128), posterior putamen (12\u00d78\u00d718 mm , NT\u200a=\u200a128) and SN (6\u00d713\u00d713 mm , NT\u200a=\u200a384) ( ). Pons and putamen data were acquired in all subjects while SN spectra were acquired from a subset of the volunteers because this acquisition necessitated a second scanning session and only 5 patients and 5 controls were able to participate in a second scan. Pons and putamen data from 11 subjects in each group were included in the final analysis because spectra from two patients and one control volunteer were excluded in each case due to unwanted coherences noted in the spectra. The selection of the pons and putamen VOIs was based on MPRAGE images reconstructed in three orthogonal planes. The boundaries of the VOIs were traced in all slices and their orientation adjusted to ensure that only pontine or putamenal tissue was included in the VOI with minimal partial volume effects. The same procedure was followed with turbo spin echo sequence images to select the SN VOI although partial volume effects could not be fully eliminated even with a \u223c1 mL VOI. The putamen and SN VOIs were selected contralaterally to the more severely affected side of patients with PD. The location of the putamenal VOI was chosen based on the known pattern of dopamine depletion in PD. Namely, dopamine depletion starts from the posterior putamen and proceeds gradually to other parts of the striatum based on  F-dopa PET  . In addition, postmortem evidence demonstrates more severe dopamine depletion in the posterior than the anterior putamen  ,  . The location of the pontine VOI was chosen based on a previous voxel based morphometry study that indicated atrophy in this region  . Localizer images were repeated at the end of the measurement from each VOI to confirm negligible gross motion of the volunteer. \n   H MR spectra obtained in one patient with PD with STEAM (TR\u200a=\u200a5 s, TE\u200a=\u200a8 ms) from three VOIs.  \nProcessing: Reconstruction of single scan free induction decays (FIDs) from phased array data, frequency and phase correction of FID arrays, FID summation, correction for residual eddy current effects, Gaussian multiplication (\u03c3\u200a=\u200a0.1 s), Fourier Transform (FT), zero-order phase correction. Positions of the VOIs are shown on T  \u2013 weighted images for pons and putamen and on a T \u2013 weighted image for substantia nigra (SN). tNAA, total N-acetylaspartate; tCho, total choline; tCr, total creatine;   myo  -Ins,   myo  -inositol. \n  \nUnsuppressed water spectra acquired from the same VOI were used to remove residual eddy current effects and to reconstruct the phased array spectra  . Single shot spectra were first averaged over 16 scans prior to frequency alignment to the NAA methyl signal. \n\n\n### Determination of anatomical structures encompassed by the VOI \n  \nTo delineate exactly which nuclei were included in our VOI, the MPRAGE and turbo spin echo images were registered by full affine transformations to the MNI152 space (average T  weighted brain image constructed from 152 normal subjects at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada) using FSL-FLIRT (Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software (FSL,  ) Linear Image Registration Tool)  . The registration matrix was then used to transform the VOI data onto the MNI152 space. Coordinates and brain regions encompassed by the VOIs were identified by using Talairach Daemon Labels of FSL  . The identification of nuclei included in the posterior pons and SN VOIs was based on visual comparison with schematic drawings of gross anatomy obtained from human brainstem atlas  ,   and a template of LC  . \n\n\n### Metabolite quantification \n  \nMetabolites were quantified using LCModel  ,  . The model spectra of alanine (Ala), aspartate (Asp), ascorbate/vitamin C (Asc), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PC), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr), GABA, glucose (Glc), glutamine (Gln), Glu, glutathione (GSH),   myo  -inositol (  myo  -Ins), lactate (Lac), NAA, N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), phosphoethanolamine (PE),   scyllo  -inositol (  scyllo  -Ins) and taurine (Tau) were generated based on previously reported chemical shifts and coupling constants  ,  . Macromolecule spectra were acquired from the occipital cortex of 5 volunteers using an inversion recovery sequence (TR\u200a=\u200a2 s, TI\u200a=\u200a0.680 s)  . Metabolite concentrations were obtained relative to an unsuppressed water spectrum acquired from the same VOI assuming a water content of 72% for pons, 78% for putamen and 76% for substantia nigra  ,  . Concentrations were not corrected for T  and T  effects because long TR and ultra-short TE values were used. Metabolites quantified with Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB, estimated error of the metabolite quantification) >50% were classified as not detected, as suggested by the LCModel manual  . As a secondary filter to select reliable metabolite concentrations, only metabolites quantified with CRLB \u226450% in at least half of the spectra from a brain region were reported. This leads to a selection of neurochemicals with average CRLB \u2264\u223c30% ( ). If the correlation between two metabolites was consistently high (correlation coefficient <\u22120.5) in a given region, their sum was reported, such as Glc + Tau, NAA + NAAG (tNAA, total NAA), Cr + PCr (tCr, total creatine), GPC + PC (tCho, total choline). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL). MRS data from the two groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance for each metabolite concentration and CRLB in each brain region. Due to the pilot nature of the study p-values shown have not been adjusted for multiple testing. Relationships between clinical scores and metabolite concentrations were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Measures of spectral quality (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and linewidth) and demographic and clinical characteristics (age, UPDRS and H&Y) of the two groups were compared using the two-tailed, unpaired student's t-test. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nPatient and control groups were not different with regards to age and gender ( ). All patients had late onset, idiopathic PD and were at H&Y stage 2, considered to be mild-to-moderate disease severity. All but one of the patients were taking L-Dopa or other antiparkinsonian medications that were held for 12 hours prior to the MR scan. \n\n shows representative spectra obtained from the 3 brain regions from a patient with PD. A VOI analysis was performed by transforming each subject's anatomical images to MNI152 space. This approach normalizes brain position and shape and limits variability of regions due to head size and position. Then, the boundaries of VOIs were traced in the MNI space and the brain regions encompassed by the VOIs were identified ( ). This analysis showed that multiple noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei were included in the pons VOI and both pars compacta and pars reticulata were included in the SN VOI. \n   The anatomical structures and nuclei encompassed by the three VOIs identified using Talairach Daemon Labels of FSL.      \nArtifact free spectra with good SNR and spectral resolution and excellent water suppression were obtained in all brain regions for both patients and controls. The full width at half maximum and SNR values determined by LCModel were not different between patients and controls for any VOI (p>0.05,  ), therefore spectral quality in patients with PD and controls was similar. Spectral linewidths were broader in the putamen and SN than those in the pons, indicative of the iron content in these regions ( ). The spectral patterns were characteristic of each of the brain regions; note for example the ratio of the creatine and choline peaks in the pons vs. the putamen and SN spectra ( ). \n\nThis spectral quality enabled the quantification of a neurochemical profile consisting of 11 metabolites in the pons and putamen and 7 metabolites in the SN ( ). The neurochemical profiles from the SN did not show significant differences between patients and controls. On the other hand, higher GABA concentrations were detected in the pons (p<0.001, 1.6\u00b10.4 \u00b5mol/g vs. 1.0\u00b10.2 \u00b5mol/g) and putamen (p<0.05, 2.1\u00b10.4 \u00b5mol/g vs. 1.6\u00b10.2 \u00b5mol/g) in patients with PD relative to controls ( ). No group differences were observed for the other metabolites ( ). To ensure that the quality of individual spectra was sufficient to accurately assess these trends, averaged spectra from the patient and control groups were quantified identically and showed the same trends ( ). Consistent with higher GABA concentration in patients, the CRLB of GABA were lower both in the pons (p<0.001, 20.1\u00b15.0 vs. 32.1\u00b16.8%) and putamen (p<0.07, 21.2\u00b15.9 vs. 27.4\u00b16.1%) in patients with PD relative to controls ( ). \n   Neurochemical profiles determined by LCModel fitting of (a) individual and (b) averaged spectra from the 3 regions-of-interest in patients with PD and healthy controls.  \nOnly metabolites quantified with Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) \u226450% in at least half of the spectra from a brain region were included in the profiles.

The striatal GABA elevation is consistent with postmortem findings in patients with PD   and with in vivo observations in an animal model of PD  ,  . The pontine GABA finding is novel. Furthermore, the GABA elevation was greater in the pons (64%) than in the putamen (32%). Data obtained from the SN in a subset of the volunteers revealed no group differences. \n\nSince Braak suggested a caudorostral progression of \u03b1-synuclein pathology in PD starting in the medulla oblongata  ,  , only one study has investigated the neurochemistry of the pons in PD with MRS  . Ratios of NAA, creatine and choline were investigated in this study, and no differences were seen between patients and controls. Nonetheless, neuronal loss in the pons including the noradrenergic neurons of the LC   and the serotonergic neurons of the raphe nucleus   is a well documented postmortem finding. Additionally, neuronal loss in the pons has been indicated by several in vivo MRI studies as a reduction in the neuromelanin-related signal localized to the LC   and atrophy of the pons/medulla detected by voxel based morphometry  . Another recent MRI study reported decreased T  in the pontomesencephalic junction   and concluded that gray matter loss was likely the major determinant of this T  decrease. Thus, a neurochemical abnormality was expected in the caudorostral extent of the pons. The most likely neurochemical alteration to indicate neuronal loss would be a lower NAA level  , which we did not observe, likely due to partial volume effects. On the other hand, we did observe a robust GABA elevation, indicating that this neurochemical difference was more widespread within the pontine VOI. The pontine VOI in this study encompassed some non-dopaminergic brainstem nuclei, such as the right and left LC, the reticular formation and the raphe nuclei ( ). It remains to be determined if the GABA abnormality relates to changes in these nuclei. Most likely this change is a result of alterations in several classes of neurons of the brainstem. For instance, others have shown a reduction in  F-dopa uptake in the LC region in patients with more advanced PD (H&Y 2\u20133) indicating a progressive loss of noradrenergic terminal function  ,  ,  . In addition, a reduction in median raphe serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A binding in PD has been reported  . Thus an elevated GABA tone can plausibly contribute to a functional deficit in the LC and raphe nuclei, which are under GABAergic regulation. Therefore, elevated GABA levels in GABAergic interneurons and terminals present in these nuclei  ,   may suppress the activity of the noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons that project to the SN. Consequently this would affect the activity of the nigral dopaminergic neurons that project to the striatum ( ). Taken together, these data suggest that altered GABAergic regulation of non-dopaminergic neurons of the pons may be relevant to PD. \n   Proposed changes in pontine-nigral-striatal pathways in PD.  \nEnhanced pontine GABAergic activity (wider arrows) onto serotonergic (5HT) locus ceruleus (LC) and/or noradrenergic (NE) raphe neurons could result in a reduction in excitatory outflow (dashed arrows) to substantia nigral neurons. As a result, this may decrease nigral dopaminergic activity to the striatum (indicated by thin dashed arrow). \n  \nRegarding our putamenal findings, postmortem studies of individuals with advanced disease demonstrated elevated striatal GABA levels, particularly in the putamen  . A negative correlation between GABA and DA was observed in the putamen in this postmortem work; suggesting that the striatal GABA elevation was associated with dopaminergic terminal loss  ,  . In line with the postmortem findings in patients, a significant increase in GABA concentration was shown in the striatum of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD  ,  . The involvement of striatal GABAergic neurotransmission in PD was further evaluated by quantification of messenger RNA coding for the 67 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), one of the two GABA synthesizing enzymes. A significant increase in GAD67 mRNA levels was measured in the putamen of MPTP-treated monkeys and rats relative to controls  ,  , consistent with elevated GABA concentrations in this region. Interestingly, manganese-exposed workers who are at high risk for PD also show significantly higher GABA levels than controls in a brain region containing the thalamus, putamen and globus pallidus  . In the current study we showed that elevated striatal GABA is present   in vivo   in patients with mild-moderate PD. This GABA elevation in the putamen likely stems from striatal GABAergic neurons, rather than GABAergic afferents, because the primary afferents to the striatum are glutamatergic and dopaminergic, while the predominant cell type in the striatum is the medium sized GABAergic spiny neurons. Animal models of PD have shown that experimental lesions of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway result in elevated striatal GABA content  , which may explain the GABA elevation observed in the putamen in PD. We did not observe a relationship between GABA levels and disease severity based on clinical measures. The lack of a correlation between GABA levels and clinical scores is likely due to the similarity of the clinical stage of our patients, i.e. a small dynamic range (all were at H&Y stage 2), and awaits further investigations with larger groups of patients in a wider range of disease stages. It remains possible that the elevated GABA concentration in the posterior putamen is secondary to a loss of nigrostriatal DA terminals, and therefore may provide complimentary information to the striatal DA depletion detectable by PET scanning  . Future cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations of DA by PET and GABA by MRS in parallel could aid in monitoring disease progression. In addition, evaluation of individuals scanned on and off medication may help clarify if the GABA elevation is secondary to DA loss. While we scanned subjects off medications for 12 hours, intermediate- and long-lasting effects of antiparkinsonian medications on the current findings cannot be excluded. Thus medication effects can be limited by studying drug-na\u00efve patients. Prospective  H MRS studies to investigate the consequences of striatal GABA alterations in other regions could also provide further insight. Specifically, investigations of GABA concentrations in the medial pallidal segment and motor thalamic nuclei would be critical since these regions play an important role regarding the outputs of the basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex. \n\nThe main limitation of our study is the small sample size. This may have prevented the detection of neurochemical alterations in the SN. Alternatively, the very small size of the VOI (\u223c1 mL) necessitated by the anatomy of the SN (resulting in low SNR), and high iron content (causing broader intrinsic linewidths,  ,  ) may have obscured neurochemical differences (note the higher standard deviations in SN vs. putamen and pons in  ). Similarly, in a prior study of the SN at 4T, we had detected trends, but no statistically significant neurochemical differences, between 10 patients with mild-moderate PD vs. 11 age- and gender-matched healthy controls  . The SN VOI utilized in the current study was \u223chalf of the size of the VOI used in our prior study   and also obliqued to better conform with nigral anatomy. \n\nWe reported raw p-values here due to the pilot nature of the study, although note that the GABA difference in the pons remains significant after a strict Bonferroni correction for the multiple metabolites measured (significance at p<0.05/11\u200a=\u200a0.0045) and therefore the finding is robust. The difference in the putamen was less significant, which may reflect the earlier involvement of the pons in PD pathogenesis. Alternatively, the CRLB cut-off (CRLB \u226450%) we used to select reliable concentrations may have biased the GABA concentration estimates of controls in the putamen. In the putamen, seven of eleven control subjects' GABA concentrations met our reliable quantification criterion and four subjects' GABA concentrations had CLRB in the range of 50\u201355% and hence were excluded from the analyses. These excluded GABA concentrations were around \u223c1 \u00b5mol/g and their inclusion would lower the average GABA concentration in the control group and increase the significance level of the GABA difference in putamen (p<0.001). On the other hand, a larger GABA difference in the pons (52%) vs. the putamen (20%) was supported by evaluation of averaged spectra ( ) that overcomes issues with insufficient SNR in spectra from individuals. \n\nRecent developments involving editing techniques have allowed reliable in vivo measurements of GABA without other overlapping resonances in the human brain  ,  ,  . In this study, we chose to utilize unedited spectroscopy to quantify a neurochemical profile and to simultaneously assess potential differences in both neuronal and glial markers, such as NAA and   myo  -inositol, respectively, and in neurotransmitter levels, such as glutamate and GABA. Based on the findings of the current study, future studies can utilize edited spectroscopy to focus on measurements of GABA in PD. However, edited MRS measurements of GABA require larger VOI than those utilized here because of longer echo times and consequently lower SNR. Also, edited GABA measurements need to take potential differences in T  between patients and controls into account when interpreting concentration differences. Such potential T  differences are negligible at the ultra-short echo times used in the current study. While T  differences between patients with PD and controls are unlikely for the pons and putamen based on similar linewidths we observed ( ), they could potentially confound the quantification of GABA concentration using edited spectroscopy in the SN based on the linewidths we observed in this VOI. Consistently, PD-dependent iron deposition in SN has shown a strong correlation with T  shortening in this region  . \n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated an elevation in pontine and putamenal GABA levels in mild-moderate PD that may underlie aspects of disease pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Whether these are primary or secondary alterations and the impact of treatment on them remain to be determined. These novel findings suggest that further studies with  H MRS may aid in assessing pathogenetic theories of PD and in disease staging together with other noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3266292, "text_md5": "591cc4fc74b5f6511d419af562197acf", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 46], "journal": [47, 55], "publication_year": [57, 61], "title": [72, 180], "keywords": [194, 194], "abstract": [207, 2019], "body": [2028, 28754]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 22295119, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0030918", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266292", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3266292"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266292\">3266292</a>", "list_title": "PMC3266292  Elevated Pontine and Putamenal GABA Levels in Mild-Moderate Parkinson Disease Detected by 7 Tesla Proton MRS"}

Nigral hyperintensity from nigrosome-1 and striatal dopamine transporter uptake are reduced in Parkinsonism; however, quantification is only possible with SPECT. Here, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based regressor model that can predict striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake on nigrosome magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker for Parkinsonism. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nBetween February 2017 and December 2018, participants who underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI including SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT based on suspected Parkinsonism were included. Two neuroradiologists evaluated the nigral hyperintensity and annotated the centroids of nigrosome-1 structures. We used a convolutional neural network-based regression model to predict striatal specific binding ratios (SBRs) measured via SPECT using the cropped nigrosome images. The correlation between measured and predicted SBRs was evaluated. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe included 367 participants (203 women (55.3%); age, 69.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 [range, 39\u201388] years). Random data from 293 participants (80%) were used for training. In the test set (74 participants [20%]), the measured and predicted  I-FP-CIT SBRs were significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity (2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85 vs. 2.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90) than with intact nigral hyperintensity (4.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24 vs. 4.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.35,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). The sorted measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs and the corresponding predicted values were significantly and positively correlated (\u03c1 \u2009=\u20090.7443; 95% confidence interval, 0.6216\u20130.8314;   P  \u2009<\u20090.01). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nA deep learning-based regressor model effectively predicted striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs based on nigrosome MRI with high correlation using manually-measured values, enabling nigrosome MRI as a biomarker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinsonism. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00234-023-03168-z. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe main pathologic process underlying Parkinsonism, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy, is \u03b1-synuclein-mediated nigrostriatal dopaminergic cell loss and iron overload in the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain [ ]. The dopaminergic cell loss in the SN occurs in structures called nigrosomes, which are three-dimensional (3D) organizations of calbindin-poor zones within calbindin-rich neuropils of the nigral complex [ ,  ]. \n\nThe recent development of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), primarily susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), has enabled the direct visualization of the nigral structures in the SN [ \u2013 ]. The normal nigrosome appearance, showing hyperintensity between the hypointense areas of the SN, can be lost in idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy, and even in premotor disease, such as isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, which can support the clinical diagnosis of the diseases [ \u2013 ]. However, although Parkinsonism is a \u201cprogressive\u201d neurodegenerative disease, the detection of nigral hyperintensity on SWI is a matter of \u201cpresence or absence,\u201d which precludes the quantification of the nigrosome status, limiting the ability of SWI to monitor disease severity or progression. Contrarily, dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging, such as  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computerized tomography ( I-FP-CIT SPECT), can provide information regarding nigrostriatal function based on quantified DaT uptake in the striatum; thus, it can diagnose Parkinsonism and monitor the disease [ ,  ]. However, compared with MRI, interpretation of SPECT does not depend on absolute change but on comparing the counts between normal and abnormal regions; in addition, SPECT is associated with the risk of radiation exposure. \n\nA few studies have focused on the agreement between SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT [ ,  ]. If the loss of nigral hyperintensity on SWI also progresses over time in correlation with the reduction in striatal DaT uptake on SPECT, we should be able to model the relationship between nigral imaging and SPECT to predict nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration on easily accessible MRI. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to develop a deep-learning-based regressor model that can predict striatal DaT uptake on nigrosome MRI, assessing the feasibility of deep learning for the quantitative interpretation of nigrosome imaging in the clinical setting for Parkinsonism. The purpose of this study was to correlate 3\u00a0T SWI with the manually measured  I-FP-CIT in the continuous domain, instead of dividing the degree space into normal and abnormal subranges, to create MRI biomarkers for Parkinsonism correlated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis prospective case-control study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution. It was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. \n\n### Study participants \n  \nConsecutive patients who visited the movement disorder center in our referral institution between February 2017 and December 2018 were eligible for the study. All were clinically assessed by a neurologist with 22\u00a0years of experience in movement disorders. Those who had suspected parkinsonian symptoms were enrolled if they underwent 3\u00a0T brain MRI examination including SWI and concurrent  I-FP-CIT SPECT. Those who exhibited severe motion artifacts on MRI, especially SWI, and who demonstrated vascular ischemia in the striatum and/or occipital cortex on MRI, which could lead to false-positive results in the calculation of specific binding ratios (SBRs) on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, were excluded. The clinical diagnosis of each participant was made in accordance with the established criteria as follows: idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease [ ], multiple system atrophy [ ], progressive supranuclear palsy [ ], isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder [ ], drug-induced Parkinsonism [ ], essential tremor [ ], vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism [ ], cerebellar ataxia [ ], Fahr\u2019s syndrome [ ], and normal pressure hydrocephalus [ ]. \n\n\n### MRI protocol \n  \nMRI was performed using a 3\u00a0T MRI scanner (Ingenia and Ingenia CX; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a 32-channel SENSE head coil. SWI was obtained using an imaging plane perpendicular to the midbrain. Imaging parameters for SWI were as follows: 3D multi-echo fast-field-echo sequence; repetition time, 88\u00a0ms; total echoes, 5; first echo time, 10\u00a0ms; echo interval, 10\u00a0ms; flip angle, 10\u00b0; field-of-view, 192\u2009\u00d7\u2009192 mm ; voxel size, 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091 mm ; 30 slices; scan time, approximately 4\u00a0min. Based on SWI acquisition, susceptibility map-weighted imaging (SMWI) was generated from the multi-echo fast-field-echo complex images to improve the visibility of the nigrosome structures [ ]. Post-processing was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) according to a previously described method [ ]. The first step was to generate magnitude images using multi-channel magnitude images. After correcting the phase offset of the individual channels, the phase images were combined as a complex mean. Next, the magnitude images at each of the five echoes were combined into a single image using the root sum of squares. Phase images at different echo times were unwrapped using the Laplacian algorithm, and the combined frequency was calculated for each voxel. Then, the background field was removed from the frequency images, and quantified susceptibility mapping was performed using the improved sparse linear equation and least-squares method [ ]. A quantified susceptibility mapping mask was generated from the quantified susceptibility mapping for susceptibility contrast weighting. Finally, an SMWI was produced by multiplying the multi-echo combined magnitude images with the quantified susceptibility mapping mask. The reconstruction slice thickness of SMWI was set at 1\u00a0mm. \n\n\n### I-FP-CIT SPECT protocol \n  \nThe participants were orally administered 6\u00a0mL of Lugol's solution before the  I-FP-CIT injection. Scans were performed 3\u00a0h after the intravenous injection of 185\u00a0MBq of  I-FP-CIT (DATrace-123\u2122, Samyoung Unitech, Seoul, Korea) with a triple-headed rotating gamma camera system (Trionix XLT; Trionix Research Laboratory, Inc., Twinsburg, OH, USA) with low-energy, ultra-resolution, parallel hole collimators. Scans were acquired in 40 steps spanning 120\u00b0, with 40\u00a0s per step, via the step-and-shoot method. Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection with a Butterworth filter (cutoff frequency, 0.4 cycle/cm; order, 13), and attenuation correction using Chang's method (coefficient of 0.12/cm). First, a nuclear medicine physician with 17\u00a0years of experience visually interpreted the  I-FP-CIT SPECT results. The reader was blinded to the clinical data and the MRI findings at the time of interpretation. The decision regarding the SPECT results for the diagnosis was based on visual inspection. For the quantification analysis, images were analyzed with a dedicated software program (DATquant, Xeleris 3.1, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Volumes-of-interest were defined automatically with DATquant, regarding the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), caudate nucleus, putamen, and occipital cortex. The SBRs of the striatal regions were calculated as follows: (mean counts in striatal regions \u2013 mean counts in the occipital cortex) / (mean counts in the occipital cortex). The averaged value was used for further analysis. \n\n\n### MRI analysis \n  \nTwo board-certified neuroradiologists (with 11 and 21\u00a0years of experience, respectively) independently evaluated the bilateral nigral hyperintensities on SMWI followed by resolving discrepancies by consensus. Normal nigral hyperintensity was defined as a focal linear or oval hyperintense area in the dorsolateral aspect of the SN surrounded by hypointensity [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Deep regressor model \n  \nTwo neuroradiologists annotated the centroids of the nigrosome-1 structures on SMWI in consensus to crop a region-of-interest (ROI) with a fixed voxel size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u00d7\u200920, which sufficiently covered the entire nigrosome-1 structure on each side. These crops were used for the deep-learning-based regression analysis. \n\nA convolutional neural network-based regression model was used to predict the target SBR because convolutional neural networks are widely used for learning discriminative image features. Specifically, we used the Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-style convolutional neural network (CNN) in our regression network (Fig.\u00a0 ). Following the original order of the VGG layers, we used 3D convolutional blocks because the input nigrosome patch is a small 3D volume.   \nDeep regressor network.\u00a0Three convolutional blocks were used, each with two convolutional layers (Conv) with a trailing max-pooling layer (Pool), to extract high-level feature maps. The feature map of the last convolutional block was flattened and passed through fully connected layers to predict a striatal SBR.\u00a0SBR, specific binding ratio; SMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging \n  \n\nThe network architecture followed a pattern similar to the VGG network where a stack of convolutional blocks first extracts high-level features from the input image, then a block of fully connected layers generates the final prediction from the extracted features. The configuration of the convolutional blocks (e.g., number and kernel size of the convolutional layers, type of the pooling layer) was also identical to the original VGG network. Nonetheless, the total number of convolutional blocks was reduced to three because of the small input size. Technical CNN architecture is described in  . \n\nThe regressor was trained using the L2-loss as the objective function, the mean squared error between the model predictions and the corresponding true SBRs on SPECT. The training was aimed to minimize the mean squared error. A learning rate of 1e\u2009\u2212\u20094 was used. \n\nThough U-net [ ] is a commonly used convolutional network for neuroimage analysis, U-net generates spatial output (e.g., segmentation) by adding a decoder block after the usual CNN encoder, which is not suitable for our task. In our method, our target SBR output is a single score assigned per patch, which is similar to the structure of the usual CNN output (e.g. class-probabilities, scalar values, etc.). Among the usual CNNs, VGG has been widely used in general medical image analysis [ ]. Recent CNN architectures (e.g. ResNet [ ]) have also been adopted in different medical image analysis tasks lately. However, VGG network with its simpler structure still remains a powerful tool under the small medical dataset. In our experiment, we also employed ResNet convolutional blocks for SBR prediction, which resulted in a poorer performance compared to the VGG blocks. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nBased on a single side, loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was compared with the ipsilateral abnormal visual result on  I-FP-CIT SPECT using the chi-square test, and the concordance rate was calculated. Next, striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs were compared according to the ipsilateral nigral hyperintensity status on SMWI. After training the deep regressor model, the predicted single-side striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs from the deep regressor model were also compared according to the status of nigral hyperintensity. The continuous predictions and  I-FP-CIT SPECT SBRs were compared using residual analysis in terms of the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. Normalized residuals were also computed after dividing the exact residuals by the SBR interval: the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the SBRs, as observed on  I-FP-CIT SPECT. Lin\u2019s correlation coefficient (\u03c1 ) was computed to determine the agreement of the predicted SBRs with the actual SBRs on  I-FP-CIT SPECT in the continuous domain. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the correlation was computed using Fisher\u2019s transform. Statistical significance was set at   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc for Windows (version 17.9; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical characteristics of the included participants \n  \nThis study included 367 participants (sex, 203 women and 164 men; age, 69.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2 [range, 39\u201388] years). The clinical diagnoses of the participants included idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (  n\u2009=  \u2009287), multiple system atrophy (  n\u2009=  \u200917), progressive supranuclear palsy (  n\u2009=  \u200914), isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (  n\u2009=  \u20099), drug-induced Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u20093), essential tremor (  n\u2009=  \u200914), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u200912), cerebellar ataxia (  n\u2009=  \u20094; including two cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6), Fahr\u2019s syndrome (  n\u2009=  \u20091), normal pressure hydrocephalus (  n\u2009=  \u20094), and healthy participants (  n\u2009=  \u20092). \n\n\n### Relationship between SMWI and  I-FP-CIT-SPECT findings \n  \nOf the 367 participants, 293 showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI and 308 showed abnormal visual results on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, with a concordance rate of 95.4% (Table  ). Among them, one participant diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease showed loss of nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but normal finding on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, presumably due to the mild decrease in striatal DaT uptake which resulted in a visually normal appearance. In addition, 16 participants showed intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI but abnormal finding on  I-FP-CIT SPECT, including idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease (  n\u2009=  \u200912), multiple system atrophy (  n\u2009=  \u20091), vascular pseudo-Parkinsonism (  n\u2009=  \u20092), and Fahr\u2019s syndrome (  n\u2009=  \u20091). The measured  I-FP-CIT SBR of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was significantly lower than that of participants with intact nigral hyperintensity (2.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.86 vs. 4.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.11,   P  \u2009<\u20090.01).   \nSMWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT findings in all study participants \n  \nValues are presented as n (%) \n\nSMWI, susceptibility map-weighted imaging;  I-FP-CIT SPECT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography \n  \n\n\n### Correlation of deep regressor-predicted and measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs \n  \nRandomly-selected data from 293 participants (80%) were used for training the deep regressor model, and 74 participants (20%) were used for the test set (Table  ).

The average distance between the predicted and measured SBRs was 0.6837\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5972 (95% CI, 0.5467\u20130.8207) with a median of 0.4727. The average distance obtained for using the ResNet convolution blocks was 0.9206\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7569 (95% CI, 0.7482\u20131.0931), which was significantly poorer than using the proposed VGG blocks (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05). The root-mean-square error of the proposed regression model was 0.9078 (95% CI, 0.7183\u20131.0641). Considering the observed range of the measured  I-FP-CIT SBR, the deep regressor showed a mean normalized error of 10.68\u2009\u00b1\u20099.39% (95% CI, 8.54%\u201312.82%), with a median error of 7.39%.   \nPlot of the predicted striatal SBRs against the sorted measured SBRs evaluated on  I-FP-CIT SPECT.\u00a0The predictions showed a good correlation of 0.744 with the SPECT evaluation.\u00a0 I-FP-CIT SPECT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography; SBR, specific binding ratio \n  \n\n\n### Activation map \n  \nThe analysis of activation maps is useful for interpreting the explicability of a deep learning model. Activation maps highlight regions of attention for prediction. Figure\u00a0  shows the activation maps for two examples (one with low SBR and one with high SBR). High attention regions highlighting the nigrosome were observed in each of these examples.   \nAttention map examples for low striatal I-FP-CIT SBR (top) and high SBR (bottom).\u00a0The leftmost images represent two examples of SMWI input. The images in the middle indicate the trimmed nigrosome patch. The images on the right show the resultant attention map blended over the input patch. The attention map is illustrated using the color map above, and an additional opacity channel, where high opacity is used for high-attention regions and low opacity is used for low-attention regions.\u00a0 I-FP-CIT,  I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane; SBR, specific binding ratio \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we demonstrated that a deep learning regressor model based on nigrosome MRI could effectively predict striatal DaT uptake on SPECT. The results of the human-based assessment of the loss of nigral hyperintensity on 3\u00a0T SMWI and the abnormal nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration on SPECT were significantly correlated, and the manually measured  I-FP-CIT SBRs were significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity. After training the deep-learning regressor model, it could predict  I-FP-CIT SBRs based on 3\u00a0T SMWI, and the predicted values were significantly correlated with the established ground truth that was manually measured, with a correlation coefficient of 0.744. Therefore, we propose that deep learning-based analysis of non-invasive 3\u00a0T nigrosome MRI could determine the striatal DaT uptake levels in patients with Parkinsonism. \n\nPresynaptic dopaminergic scans, such as  I-FP-CIT SPECT, are more sensitive indicators of Parkinsonism than clinical examinations as they detect nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration [ ]. DaT imaging quantifies the degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration by measuring DaT uptake in the striatum, which is an effective tool to diagnose Parkinsonism and monitor disease progression [ ]. However, current DaT imaging techniques are accompanied by ionizing radiation exposure, which makes repeated examinations in a single patient along with the disease progression clinically challenging. Its accessibility is limited compared to MRI, as the examination can be invasive due to the radiotracer injection, and its cost is relatively high. \n\nWith high-resolution MRI, the nigral structures of nigrosomes have been successfully visualized on 3\u00a0T SMWI, and their loss has been a strong diagnostic indicator of Parkinsonism. This was a breakthrough in the imaging-based diagnosis of Parkinsonism since 3\u00a0T SMWI can be applied in patients without any risk of radiation exposure and can be repeated as many times as clinically needed. Thus, the loss of nigral hyperintensity on MRI may correspond to dopaminergic denervation on DaT imaging. Striatal  I-FP-CIT uptake can be significantly lower with the loss of nigral hyperintensity on SWI than with intact nigral hyperintensity [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In addition, decreased striatal DaT uptake might precede the loss of nigral hyperintensity in a sequential process [ ,  ]. Accordingly, 16 participants in our study showed abnormal  I-FP-CIT SPECT finding but intact nigral hyperintensity on SMWI as previously reported [ ,  ]. One study previously showed a large overlap between SBRs of participants with intact and non-intact nigral hyperintensities [ ]. Another study also determined the quantified  I-FP-CIT uptake level based on the nigral hyperintensity status on 3\u00a0T SMWI, where the nigrosome signal is lost when striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs drop below certain thresholds [ ]. When nigrosomes appear morphologically normal but striatal DaT uptake slightly decreased, the MRI findings may be falsely negative for early Parkinson\u2019s disease. Therefore, imaging-based diagnosis of Parkinsonism solely based on MRI can be misleading, and DaT imaging is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. \n\nNigral hyperintensity in patients with Parkinsonism may progressively decrease along with striatal DaT uptake during the disease process. However, the human eye cannot detect the partial loss of nigral hyperintensity before its total loss; thus, it can only provide a qualitative assessment, capturing either the presence or absence of nigral hyperintensity. Consequently, the demand has increased for quantifying nigral hyperintensity and determining its correlation with striatal DaT uptake for disease monitoring using SWI by adopting a deep learning-based approach. However, a recent study utilizing CNN for the deep learning-based assessment of the SN on SWI could only determine the presence or absence of nigrosome-1 but not provide any quantitative data possibly correlating with DaT imaging [ ]. For the deep learning-based evaluation of the nigral SMWI prediction of SBRs, our choices for the analytic method could be either segmentation-based or regression-based estimation. The segmentation-based method can provide interpretable results if the segmentation result is visible; however, it necessitates a dedicated post-processing step, and the derived results of segmentation are a mere intermediate step to the estimation of SBRs, not an end product. However, regression-based estimation permits the direct estimation of the parameter of interest using a segmentation-free regression network, and with deep learning, it can provide more accurate end-to-end results [ ]. Therefore, in our study, we chose regression-based estimation over segmentation-based estimation to predict SBRs using SMWI. \n\nOur deep learning-based regressor model can quantitatively predict striatal DaT uptake based on 3\u00a0T SMWI in patients with Parkinsonism. The degree of decrease in striatal DaT uptake can be predicted using nigrosome MRI, making non-invasive 3\u00a0T SMWI both a diagnostic indicator and disease monitoring tool for Parkinsonism. Notably, the high attention regions on the attention maps were correlated with the regions of presenting nigral hyperintensity from the nigrosome-1; therefore, we can assume that the degree of the remaining nigral hyperintensity on SMWI was primarily used for the network to predict striatal DaT uptake. Until recently, the quantitative assessment of Parkinsonism using MRI has mainly focused on the use of neuromelanin MRI, rather than nigrosome MRI. The area and contrast ratio of T1 high-signal neuromelanin pigmentation in the SN decreased in patients with Parkinsonism [ ], in correlation with striatal DaT uptake [ \u2013 ]. The area of T1 high-signal neuromelanin-rich SN is easier to segment and measure than the more irregular and smaller shape of nigral hyperintensity, leading to several deep learning-based analyses of the neuromelanin-rich SN in Parkinsonism and the prodromal phase [ \u2013 ]. Nigrosome MRI can be utilized to diagnose Parkinsonism based on the loss of nigral hyperintensity, but the quantitative correlation between nigral hyperintensity and DaT uptake cannot be performed, while the decrease in the area and the signal of the neuromelanin-rich area can be quantitatively correlated with DaT uptake but is difficult to utilize for the individual diagnosis of Parkinsonism [ ]. However, as our current study has provided a quantitative analysis of SMWI-based nigrosome imaging in correlation with DaT uptake using a deep learning-based regressor model, the overall role of MRI in assessing Parkinsonism can be expanded by covering individual diagnosis, quantification, and correlation with DaT imaging, and even monitoring disease progression. \n\nOur study had some limitations. First, as we enrolled participants with concomitant examinations of 3\u00a0T SWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT, those included were mainly diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, whereas the number of disease control participants was unavoidably small. The number of participants in the training set was unevenly distributed among disease categories. Second, as the number of patients with isolated rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder was relatively small, we could not analyze the diagnostic performance for the prodromal phase separately, and the potential strength of our regressor model in predicting phenoconversion from premotor disease could not be determined. Future studies should focus on the use of our regressor model in patients with prodromal diseases. Third, as this study was performed in a single institution, our study results could not be externally validated. It was difficult to find an external dataset that included simultaneous 3\u00a0T SMWI and  I-FP-CIT SPECT images, as in our study design. Although our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based regressor correlating nigrosome MRI with striatal DaT imaging, further validation using external cohorts is needed. To generalize our results, variable nigrosome MRI obtained from different scanners and sites should be used for further validation. Therefore, future multicenter studies are needed to set up optimized imaging protocols for nigral MRI. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur proposed deep learning-based regressor model effectively showed that nigrosome MRI findings could be correlated with striatal DaT uptake on SPECT in the continuous domain. It could predict striatal  I-FP-CIT SBRs with a high correlation with manually measured values based on 3\u00a0T SMWI.

Sublocalization of this protein may be relevant for the formation of multimeric \u03b1-syn oligomeric configurations, insoluble aggregates that form Lewy bodies in PD brains. Processing of this protein aggregation is regulated by associations with distinct lipid classes. For instance, instability of lipid raft (LR) microdomains, membrane regions with a particular lipid composition, is an early event in the development of PD. However, the relevance of membrane microdomains in the regulation and trafficking of the distinct \u03b1-syn configurations associated with PD remains unexplored. In this study, using 6- and 14-month-old healthy and MPTP-treated animals as a model of PD, we have investigated the putative molecular alterations of raft membrane microstructures, and their impact on \u03b1-syn dynamics and conformation. A comparison of lipid analyses of LR microstructures and non-raft (NR) fractions showed alterations in gangliosides, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and phospholipids in the midbrain and cortex of aged and MPTP-treated mice. In particular, the increase of PUFA and phosphatidylserine (PS) during aging correlated with \u03b1-syn multimeric formation in NR. In these aggregates, \u03b1-syn was phosphorylated in pSer129, the most abundant post-transductional modification of \u03b1-syn promoting toxic aggregation. Interestingly, similar variations in PUFA and PS content correlating with \u03b1-syn insoluble accumulation were also detected in membrane microstructures from the human cortex of incidental Parkinson Disease (iPD) and PD, as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, structural changes in membrane lipid microenvironments may induce rearrangements in raft-interacting proteins involved in other neuropathologies. Therefore, we also investigated the dynamic of other protein markers involved in cognition and memory impairment such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR2B), prion protein (PrPc) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose activity depends on membrane lipid organization. We observed a decline of these protein markers in LR fractions with the progression of aging and pathology. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lipid alterations in membranous compartments promoted by brain aging and PD-like injury may have an effect on \u03b1-syn aggregation and segregation in abnormal multimeric structures. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a condition associated with aging that affects different brain areas, in particular the substantia nigra   pars compacta   (SNpc). It is also the most prevalent clinical manifestation of a family of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by an abnormal accumulation of aggregates of the protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in neurons, nerve fibers and glial cells, aptly named synucleinopathies ( ). A main anatomopathological hallmark of these diseases is the accumulation of such aggregates into intracellular neuronal inclusions named Lewy bodies (LB), and dopaminergic neurons degeneration ( ). \u03b1-syn has been characterized in different configuration states from monomeric forms, fibrils and oligomers ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The predominant species of the toxic aggregates is \u03b1-syn abnormally phosphorylated on Ser-129, a pathological modification that facilitates fibril formation and insoluble aggregation ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Most data agree that accumulating \u03b1-syn insoluble oligomers is a main neuropathological feature of PD and related synucleinopathies ( ;  ;  ;  ), although it is still controversial whether low size protofibrils may also cause neuronal death ( ;  ). \n\nEvidence has demonstrated that \u03b1-syn is present in both an unfolded cytosolic form and a membrane-bound form that assumes an \u03b1-helical conformation ( ;  ;  ). In healthy neurons, \u03b1-syn predominantly binds to presynaptic membranes, where the protein appears to be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release, vesicle transport and fusion machinery ( ;  ;  ;  ). Furthermore, the synaptic localization of \u03b1-syn is mediated by binding with high affinity to membrane lipid microenvironments, thereby contributing to the normal functionality of the protein ( ;  ). \n\nPrevious studies have concluded that lipid membrane interaction determines the structural modifications and functionality of \u03b1-syn ( ). In fact, the interaction of \u03b1-syn with lipid membranes is highly dependent on both the phospholipid fatty acid composition and the ratio of the protein to phospholipid ( ;  ). However, it is still unclear how the binding of this protein to the plasma membrane may contribute to pathological activity. For instance, physical interaction of \u03b1-syn in specific lipid microenvironments, such as LRs may determine the level of multimerization and configuration of this protein. LRs are plasma membrane microdomains with a peculiar structure and distinct lipid composition where numerous signaling proteins converge ( ). These microdomains are characterized by their high content in Cho, sphingomyelin and gangliosides such as GM1. LRs are known as key points to facilitate amyloid-like seeding and toxic oligomerization associated with different neuropathologies, where it is likely that cross-seeding may be a common feature for promotion of aberrant molecular aggregates ( ;  ;  ;  ). Numerous publications suggest that membrane lipid composition may play a crucial role in the formation of misfolded proteins associated with proteinopathies such as PD, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), prion diseases and dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) ( ;  ;  ;  ). In particular related to synucleopathies, previous work has demonstrated that \u03b1-syn interacts with different lipid classes significantly represented in LRs, including ganglioside GM1 ( ), and PUFA, such as AA, 20:4 and DHA, 22:6 ( ;  ). Although still poorly characterized, the integrity of LRs may be crucial for the functional integration of \u03b1-syn in membrane regions, observing a reduction of \u03b1-syn presence in presynaptic membranes following chemical disruption of LR microstructures ( ). However, it is still unknown whether membrane lipid microenvironments may have an effect on the seeding and development of \u03b1-syn oligomeric species. \n\nConsidering the preferential binding of \u03b1-syn within LR microenvironments, it is plausible that the configuration of distinct protein conformations may be regulated by specific lipid classes. Thus, preferential binding of this protein to PUFA in raft-like liposomes requires a multifactorial combination with PS and oleic acid (18:1 n-9) ( ). Interestingly, PUFA may play a role in \u03b1-syn reorganization as reflected by the increased levels of these fatty acids in \u03b1-syn knock-out mice ( ). In support of this, association with PUFA acyl groups, such as arachidonoyl and docosahexaenoyl, appears to induce a rapid multimerization of \u03b1-syn ( ) that may promote the formation of toxic formations. In addition, other studies have demonstrated a pathological \u03b1-syn oligomerization process when binding to DHA ( ,  ). Conversely, other data has evidenced that enhancement of \u03b1-syn membrane lipid binding to specific gangliosides prevents its aggregation and neurotoxicity ( ). In particular, interaction of monomeric \u03b1-syn with GM1 ganglioside inhibits the protein fibrillation ( ). These results indicate that \u03b1-syn configuration in the lipid matrix may depend on the combinatorial composition of specific membrane lipid classes interacting with this protein, leading to normal or pathological formations. Adding more complexity to this scenario, the different \u03b1-syn conformations may also influence their interactions within lipid environments. In this sense, recent biophysical data have demonstrated that toxic \u03b1-syn oligomerization reduces the ability of this protein to interact with lipid membranes depending upon their chemical composition ( ). Overall, these data support the importance of neuronal membrane lipid composition and microenvironment in the regulation of \u03b1-syn conformational structure and functionality. \n\nOur previous work has shown that LRs exhibit pathological modifications with the progression of aging that are exacerbated in age-related neuropathologies ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ). In particular, aged LRs exhibit altered raft lipidomic profiles and physicochemical properties that affect protein associations and may contribute to the cell-cell propagation of toxic \u03b1-syn aggregates ( ;  ). In this order of ideas, we have demonstrated in the human frontal cortex of both incidental and advanced PD subjects, the presence of lipid changes in LRs that correlate with the progression of the disease ( ;  ). Noticeably, even in asymptomatic incidental PD (iPD) brains, there was a detectable reduction of AA and DHA, in parallel with an increase of saturated fatty acids (SFA, 16:0 and 18:0). These alterations induce a loss of stability in LRs that correlates with variations of the peroxidability and unsaturation indices among other factors and an increase of viscosity (membrane-ordered) microstructure ( ). The perturbations in the physicochemical properties of LRs enhance aberrant signaling protein rearrangements, amyloidogenesis, amyloid aggregation and toxic cell signaling in aged-associated neurodegenerative diseases ( ;  ;  ;  ). These findings reflect the relevance of lipid microstructures in the pathological progression of PD ( ). \n\nAnother consequence of altered structure of LRs during neuropathology is that they may modify the interactions of raft-integrated multiprotein associations. A big body of data indicates that aberrant oligomerization of key self-aggregating protein markers in different proteionopathies, such as amyloid beta (Ab), the prion protein (PrPc) and \u03b1-syn, may form multicomplexes with other membrane-related proteins, thus contributing to neuropathological features. In this sense, \u03b1-syn has been found associated with PrPc, a phenomenon involved in synaptic dysfunction ( ). This interaction mediates the activation of NMDAR2B through mGluR5 triggering early synaptic and cognitive deficits in mice. These multimeric signaling platforms may also be modulated by the biochemical interrelations with membrane-integrated molecular compounds ( ;  ). Thus, PrPc tightly binds to ganglioside GM1 which is preferentially found in LR membrane microstructures ( ). For instance, it has been postulated that GM1 may act as a scaffolding molecule that provides stabilization of this protein in the lipid physicochemical environment ( ). \n\nTaking into account previous data, it is relevant to investigate the potential correlation of alterations in the membrane binding of \u03b1-syn with membrane lipid structure aberrations generated during PD progression that still remain unexplored. Here, using the MPTP mouse model of PD, we have analyzed the consequences of PD-like pathology and aging on either \u03b1-syn distribution or configuration in membrane biochemical fractionation of the midbrain, cortex and cerebellum. We selected cortical regions based upon our previous observations in human brains where profound changes in lipid profiles were detected ( ;  ). Both the cortex and the midbrain have been characterized as the main brain regions affected by PD pathology. Indeed, cognitive impairment is one of the early clinical features of PD, occurring before motor symptoms. For comparison, the cerebellum was also included in this study. Furthermore, LRs isolated from human frontal cortex of asymptomatic incidental PD (iPD) and PD brains were also investigated to further validate the impact of the findings in the animal model. \n\nThe results demonstrate that both aging and neurotoxic treatment modify lipid profiles of membrane microdomains, in correlation with an increase in multimeric \u03b1-syn aggregation and phosphorylation. In addition, membrane lipid impairment may also affect the partitioning of other protein markers involved in the neuropathology, such as PrPc, mGluR5, NMDAR2B, and APP. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Materials \n  \nMPTP-HCl, Cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and SIGMAFAST DAB with Metal Enhancer were purchased from BioSigma (Tenerife, Spain). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against TH, and mouse monoclonal antibody 5G4 against aggregated \u03b1-syn were purchased from Millipore (Madrid, Spain). The Dynabeads Coupling Kit was from Thermo Scientific (Madrid, Spain).

The phosphoBLOCKER blocking reagent and the phospho antibody stripping solution were from Cell Biolabs, Inc (Madrid, Spain). The Complete protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Barcelona, Spain). \n\n\n### Animal Handling and Treatment \n  \nSix-months- and fourteen-months-old female C57BL/6J mice weighing 25-30 g were housed in enriched cages with food and water   ad libitum  , and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle in the Animal Facilities at La Laguna University. All procedures were performed in accordance with the European Community Directive (86/609/UE) and Universidad de La Laguna Ethics Committee guidelines for the care of laboratory animals. \n\nFour experimental groups were established. Six-months and 14-months-old mice received daily injections of 4 mg MPTP/kg/day for 20 days (respectively,   M6   and   M14  ). Age-matched controls of these two groups were treated with saline (respectively,   W6   and   W14  ). Mice were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed 43 days after finishing the treatment. MPTP-treatment method has been shown to induce a progressive dopaminergic cell loss ( ). For LRs isolations tissue was immediately dissected and frozen. Four animals per experimental group were used. For immunohistochemically analysis, animals were perfused with saline and 4% r-formaldehyde. Tissues were post-fixed in 4% r-formaldehyde for 24 h and processed to be included in paraffin block processing of neural tissues. Three animals per experimental group were used. \n\n\n### Human Brain Samples \n  \nHuman samples were acquired from the Institute of Neuropathology Brain Bank (Bellvitge University Hospital) following legal and ethical guidelines for Biomedical Research involving human subjects (Declaration of Helsinki) and approval of the local Ethics Committee. Autopsies were conducted 3\u201312 h post-mortem. Brains were bisected into hemispheres with one hemisphere immediately store at -80\u00b0C until used for molecular studies. LR isolation was processed in the Institute of Neuropathology Brain Bank following standard protocols ( ) with slight modifications previously described by our group ( ;  ). The frontal cortex of five cases with PD (average age 72.8 years), five cases with incidental PD (average 71.2 years), and six age-matched controls with no neurological symptoms and signs (age 75.2 years) were analyzed. Subjects with iPD did not report neurological anomalies, although PD-related neuropathological markers were found in the post-mortem study. \n\n\n### Immunohistochemistry \n  \nMice whole brain samples were coronally cut into 10 \u03bcm sections with a paraffin microtome, and mounted on glass slides pretreated with (3-Aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane. \n\nSlides were deparaffinized by immersion in xylene (2x 15 min), and rehydrated using graded ethanol (2x 100% for 5 min; 95% for 5 min; 90% for 5 min; 80% for 5 min; 70% for 5 min), followed by washes with distilled water (2x 5 min) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 2x 5 min). For antigen retrieval slides were boiled for 15 min in 20 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). After three washes with tris-buffered-saline (TBS), slides were incubated overnight at room temperature (RT) with primary antibody for TH diluted 1:500 in TBS. Slides were washed three times in TBS, and then incubated 2 h at RT with the specific secondary-HRP antibody diluted 1:200 in TBS. After washing three times with TBS, Signal was developed using SIGMAFAST DAB (3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) with metal enhancer (Sigma Aldrich). After washing in distilled water, slides were dehydrated in graded ethanol dilutions, and xylene and permanently mounted with Eukitt (O. Kindler, Freiburg, Germany). \n\n\n### Quantification of TH+ Cells in the SNpc \n  \nSections comprising the substantia nigra   pars compacta   were selected for immunohistochemistry with TH. Those sections that produced positive staining were photographed, and positive cells were counted with ImageJ software. For each animal evaluated, total number of positive cells was calculated by adding up the number of cells in each section. \n\n\n### Isolation of Lipid Rafts \n  \nLipid raft isolation was performed according to previous protocols ( ) with slight modifications ( ). Cortex (Co), midbrain (Md), and cerebellum (Cb) were homogenized in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl , 150 mM NaCl), containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol, and supplemented with 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na VO , 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, and complete protease inhibitor. All the steps were performed on ice. Brain homogenates were centrifuged at 500   g   for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected and mixed in an orbital rotor for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Sucrose solutions of 80, 36, and 15% were prepared in buffer A. About 800 mL of each homogenate were added to an equal volume of 80% sucrose solution, and overlaid with 7.5 mL of a 36% sucrose solution and 2.7 mL of a 15% sucrose solution, in ultracentrifuge tubes (Ultraclear, Beckman, Izasa, Tenerife, Spain). Sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 150,000   g   for 18 h at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. Fractions (F1\u2013F6) of 2 mL were collected from the top to the bottom and the final pellet were collected, and resuspended in 200 mL of buffer A, and stored at -80\u00b0C. Fractions F1 and F2 corresponded to LR microdomains, whilst pellet (F6) comprised the non-raft fraction. Protein contents in each fraction were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method and western blot assays were conducted in order to characterize the different fractions. \n\n\n### Slot-Blot Analysis \n  \nFor gangliosides and glutamatergic receptors detection, corresponding volumes for 200 ng of total protein of each gradient fraction were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane sealed on a Slot-blot set-up (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with TBS containing 3.5% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at RT. For each ganglioside and glutamatergic receptor analyzed one membrane was spotted. The immunodetection of GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b gangliosides was performed by incubation with specific mouse monoclonal antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary-HRP antibody. Rabbit monoclonal anti-mGluR5 antibody and rabbit polyclonal Anti-NMDAR2B antibody were used for the immunodetection of corresponding receptors. For the GM1 ganglioside detection, membranes were incubated with the cholera toxin B subunit-HRP (1/20000, Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min at RT. In all cases, signal was developed with Clarity  Western ECL Substrate. Detection was performed with Chemie-Doc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad), and its optical density analyzed using Image Lab software. \n\n\n### Lipid Analysis \n  \nLipid analyses were performed following previously described protocol ( ). Briefly, total lipids from LR and NR fractions were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) containing 0.01% of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as an antioxidant. Only gray matter was used. The organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipid content was determined gravimetrically. Lipid classes were separated by one-dimensional double development high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Two different solvents were used depending on the lipid classes to be extracted: methyl acetate/isopropanol/chloroform/methanol/KCl 0.25% (5:5:5:2:1.8 v/v) for the polar lipid classes, and hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (22.5:2.5:0.25 v/v) for the neutral lipid classes. For quantification, plates were processed for charring with 3% (w/v) aqueous cupric acetate containing 8% (v/v) phosphoric acid. Lipid classes were quantified by scanning densitometry, using a Shimadzu CS-9001PC dual wavelength spot scanner. Equal amounts of total lipids were used in all analyses. \n\nFatty acids composition was determined from total lipids in the fractions upon acid-catalyzed transmethylation for 16 h at 50\u00b0C, using 1 ml of toluene and 2 mL of 1% sulfuric acid (v/v) in methanol. The resultant fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and dimethyl acetals (DMA) were purified in thin layer chromatography (TLC), and quantified using a TRACE GC Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. Individual FAME and DMA were identified by reference to proper standards. \n\n\n### SDS-PAGE and Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis \n  \nLipid raft fractions containing approximately 30 mg of protein were cleaned with readyPrep 2-D cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad) and resuspended in DeStreak rehydration solution (GE Healthcare) in a total volume of 125 \u03bcL. Samples were applied to immobilized pH gradient 7 cm-length strips pH 3-10, and processed for isoelectrofocusing (IEF) up to 20,000 V/h. Then, IEF strips were reduced in equilibration buffer containing 2% (w/v) dithiothreitol (DTT) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by alkylation in equilibration buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature. Strips were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE for second dimension resolution. In other set of experiments, protein extracts were resuspended in loading buffer for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. \n\n\n### Immunoblotting \n  \nProteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinyl (PVDF) membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo rapid western blotting transfer system (Bio-Rad, Madrid, Spain). PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% BLOTTO (non-fat dried milk in TBS plus 0.1 Tween-20). Then, membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the different primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (5G4 clone), anti-\u03b1-synuclein (4D6 clone), anti-PrPc, anti-A\u03b2 peptide, and anti-APP antibodies; the rabbit polyclonal anti-pSer129 \u03b1-syn and anti-Flotillin-1 antibodies; and the rabbit monoclonal (anti-\u03b1-synuclein [EPR20535] antibody). All antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 in BLOTTO, except antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz biotech that were diluted 1:200 according to manufacturer\u2019s indications. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20. Proteins were detected using the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:5,000 for 1h at room temperature. Specific bands were developed with Clarity  Western ECL Substrate and processed using Chemie-Doc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The optical density was analyzed using Image Lab software. \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \nNumerical data were represented either as mean \u00b1 SEM or normalized to young, healthy control (W6), based on clarity. Statistical significance and statistical analysis performed is detailed in every figure, as calculated in GraphPad Prism 8 statistical software. Briefly, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test was used when comparing experimental cohorts, and Two-way ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD when comparing the effect of aging and treatment in different brain regions. Group size also varies for different experiments, and it has been indicated in figure legends. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Loss of TH Within SNpc Induced by MPTP Lesion \n  \nThe substantia nigra   pars compacta   (SNpc) is a brain area highly affected in PD pathology, with a significant reduction of dopaminergic neurons. Thereby, we first evaluated the effects of MPTP hydrochloride treatment (4 mg/kg once a day for 20 days) in aged (14 months old) mice as compared to young (6 months old) ones. We established four experimental mice groups:   W6,   control 6-months old mice;   M6,   MPTP-treated 6-months old mice;   W14,   control 14-months old mice; and   M14,   MPTP-treated 14-months old mice ( ). The total TH-IR was determined for each mouse in the different brain slices stained with anti-TH antibody (>20 slices per animal). Then, average values for each group were calculated (  n   = 3/group). A significant reduction of TH-IR (>20%) was observed in MPTP-treated mice since 6-months age, also detecting similar reduction values of 14-months old mice in both control and MPTP-treated groups ( ). \n  \nCharacterization of the MPTP neurotoxicity in the animal model.   (A)   Schematic timeline of the experiments. 6-month- and 14-month-old littermate animals were injected with either saline vehicle or 4 mg/kg MPTP once a day for 20 days and their brains extracted 43 days after the end of the treatment, thus creating four experimental cohorts.   (B)   Immunostaining against TH in the substantia nigra   pars compacta   region of wild type (W) and MPTP-treated (M) mice for two different age cohorts, 6- and 14-month-old (W6, M6, W14, and M14).   (C)   Quantification of TH-immunostaining in the different experimental groups (  p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6 (  N   = 3). White bar = 100 \u03bcm. \n  \nThese results indicate that MPTP treatment and, to a lesser extent, aging, induce a significant reduction of dopaminergic activity in SNpc, thus emulating significant injury occurring during PD pathology. \n\n\n### Alterations in Gangliosides and PUFA Content in Lipid Rafts by MPTP Treatment \n  \nGangliosides are highly abundant in LRs as part of their intrinsic structure. Numerous raft-integrated proteins are known to be tightly associated with these lipids. To investigate the potential alterations of the brain major ganglioside classes, GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b following MPTP neurotoxicity, LR and non-raft (NR) fractions of the different age-and MPTP-treated experimental groups (W6, M6, W14, and M14) were explored. Membrane fractions were extracted from Md, Co, and cCb. Md and Co are main brain regions affected in PD. Cb was used as a control, as the membrane lipid profiles of this part of the CNS have been shown to remain invariable ( ). \n\nIn these membrane samples, we analyzed by slot blot the potential changes in ganglioside content using specific antibodies specifically directed against the main brain ganglioside species (GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b). The sum of these four gangliosides was also analyzed in order to have an approximate idea of total gangliosides. Cholera toxin coupled to HRP was used to visualize GM1 amount, as this toxin is known to bind specifically to GM1 on the membrane surface ( ; see   for the results of all four animals used for quantification). Moreover, an antibody directed against LR scaffolding protein flotillin-1 was used as a protein marker of rafts for value normalization ( ). Additionally, we normalized immunosignals vs. young healthy controls (W6). The slot blots showed that the ganglioside GM1 was exclusively localized in LR, with no significant differences found between the different nervous regions or experimental cohorts relative to flotillin 1 ( ). In contrast, total ganglioside distribution in LR was significantly altered following MPTP-related neurotoxicity ( ). In particular in Co (red), we observed an increase of the total ganglioside amount following MPTP treatment. Although not statistically significant, we also observed a marked upward trend in Md associated with age and neurotoxicity ( , green). These data indicate that the neurotoxic treatment affects the ganglioside partitioning in micromembrane structures. \n  \n (A)   Slot-blot analysis of ganglioside GM1 in lipid raft (LR) and non-raft (NR) fractions. Three different CNS functional areas were studied in the four experimental cohorts: midbrain (Md), cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb), with normalization vs. W6 values used as a control.   (B)   Quantification of ganglioside GM1 levels in LR isolated from the same three CNS areas normalized vs. W6.   (C)   Slot-blot analysis of scaffolding protein flotillin1 in the same regions.   (D)   Quantification of total ganglioside (GM1 + GD1a + GD1b + GT1b) levels in LR normalized vs. W6.   p   < 0.05, Two-way ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD (  N   = 4). \n  \n\n### Nerve Tissue Lipid Classes and Fatty Acids in Membrane Distinct Fractions \n  \nTo further explore the potential changes occurring in the lipid matrix following mice injury and aging, we next analyzed the lipid composition of the different nerve fractions in aged MPTP mice. The complete analysis of the different lipid classes and fatty acids from the three nerve regions are detailed in  ,  . Midbrain lipid matrix, in comparison with Co and Cb, was highly affected by MTP-related neurotoxicity. Co and Cb also showed a similar trend decrease in their relative lipid amount. \n\nA careful analysis of the extensive raw data revealed relevant changes in specific lipid classes and fatty acids of LRs during aging and MPTP phenotype as compared with young healthy mice, summarized as follows ( ): sulfated galactosylceramides (sulfatides) were exclusively present in LR fractions. This is an indicative of the purity of LR extraction, as previously described ( ). Remarkably, we observed an increase in Cho during aging and in response to pharmacological insult. Conversely, the levels of the most abundant PUFA in nerve cells, DHA and AA, were diminished. The total phospholipid content was also lower in aged and treated animals. Moreover, the proportion of PUFA versus Cho content significantly varied, detecting a detriment in aged and MPTP animals. This was in parallel with an increase in the ratio SFA/UFA. As a consequence of the fluctuations in SFA and PUFA content, unsaturation index (UI) was reduced in aged and MPTP animals as compared to young controls. These findings are in line with previous analyses in LR from human cortical areas in both PD and LBD synucleopathies ( ;  ). \n  \n (A)   Lipid profiles of midbrain (Md) cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb) across the experimental cohorts in lipid raft (LR) fractions, following aging (M6 vs. W6, left) and MPTP treatment (M6 vs. W6 and M14 vs. W14, right).   (B)   Lipid profiles of midbrain (Md) cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb) across the experimental cohorts in non-raft (NR) fractions in aged (M6 vs. W6, left) and treated (M6 vs. W6 and M14 vs. W14, right) cohorts (  N   = 4). \n  \nIn the aim of establishing a comparative analysis of the lipid profiles between the membrane biochemical partitioning, we next performed a comparative analyses of NR lipid profiles ( ). Noticeably, we found a Cho downward and PUFA upward trend following aging and MPTP treatment that inversely correlated the one found in LR in all three regions. Indeed, Cho was depleted whereas PUFA showed higher content in NR fractions. Furthermore, there were higher levels of total phospholipids (PL), PS in particular, with aging and after treatment in aged mice. Interestingly, MPTP-induced injury generated a detectable increase in PUFA/Cho, PL/PUFA and PL/Cho ratios of aged MPTP animals in all three regions as well, particularly in aged mice. \n\nPrevious work has demonstrated that lipid interaction with \u03b1-syn requires a PS combination with PUFA (AA and DHA) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) ( ), a phenomenon that triggers the rapid multimerization of \u03b1-syn ( ;  ;  ). To explore whether mice aging or PD-like treatment may induce reassemblies of these lipid molecules, we analyzed the relative proportions of PS, DHA and oleic acid in nerve membrane microdomains. Interestingly, there was an upward trend in PS changes in Md and Co nerve regions induced by aging ( ). For instance, PS showed a marked increase in NR in all three nerve regions, as manifested by the increased PS NR/LR ratio. \n  \n (A)   PS levels in midbrain (Md) cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb) across the experimental cohorts in non-raft (NR) vs. its lipid raft (LR) fractions (  p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6).   (B)   Cumulative mole percentage of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexanoic acid (22.6n-3) (AA and DHA, respectively), oleic acid (18:1n-9) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in NR fractions from midbrain (Md) cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb).   p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6 (  N   = 4). No significant differences were found between treated and saline littermates. \n  \nMoreover, the net percentage of PS, DHA and oleic acid revealed a significant rise in the content of these lipid classes that accounted for over the \u223c60% of total lipid impairment ( ). Level changes were exclusive of PS, not observing a combinatory significant trend with any other phospholipids (data not shown). Intriguingly, a simple mathematical analysis of the statistical values showed that, despite an increasing average, the standard deviation of these data decreased (data not shown). \n\nWe further explored the potential bivariate relationships between PUFA (DHA+AA) and PS in these LRs (SQR(DHA+AA) PS. The results indicated that, in particular in Md and Co of aged animals, MPTP-induced neurotoxicity induced a linear dissociation between PS and PUFA as compared to young control mice ( ). \n\n\n### Increased Membrane Accumulation of \u03b1-syn Multimeric Formations With MPTP Neurotoxicity and Aging \n  \nPrevious data has shown that \u03b1-syn is tightly bound to lipid species highly represented in LR microstructures, including gangliosides and PUFA ( ;  ). These distinct interactions with particular lipid classes may regulate \u03b1-syn configuration at the neuronal membrane ( ) However, whether PD-related raft lipid alterations may enhance abnormal \u03b1-syn aggregation remains uncharacterized. \n\nIn order to explore whether MPTP PD-like toxicity may promote changes in \u03b1-syn configuration in correlation with lipid changes in membrane microstructures, we analyzed in both LR and NR fractions of the distinct experimental mice groups (W6, M6, W14, M14) the presence of \u03b1-syn monomeric and multimeric forms. We performed Western Blot (WB) analyses in protein extracts from Md, Co and Cb using specific antibodies that recognize distinct \u03b1-syn configurations (see Materials and Methods). We opted for normalizing WB immunosignals vs. young healthy controls\u2019 (W6) values to better reflect changes in distribution and configuration of \u03b1-syn in response to age and treatment. Therefore, the statistical significance refers to the magnitude of the relative change of \u03b1-syn amount vs. control. \n\nThe results showed that monomeric \u03b1-syn was visualized as the 14 kDa band ( ). This form was abundant in NR in all three CNS functional areas studied ( ). Moreover, we found an increase of multimeric \u03b1-syn forms with both aging and treatment, in particular in Co ( , middle). NR fractions of Md also exhibited a similar increase in the presence of \u03b1-syn multimers ( ). In contrast, Cb levels of the protein significantly decreased in NR with age and treatment ( ). \n  \n (A)   Immunoblotting distribution of monomeric, oligomeric (anti- alpha synuclein [EPR20535] antibody, from Abcam) and aggregated \u03b1-syn (5G4 antibody, from Millipore) forms in midbrain (Md) cortex (Co) and cerebellum (Cb) across the experimental cohorts in lipid raft (LR) and non-raft (NR) fractions.   (B)   Quantification of monomeric and aggregated \u03b1-syn forms in non-raft fractions (since this protein was absent or only slightly represented in lipid rafts) from the immunoblotting assay from the same three CNS functional areas normalized versus W6. Notice that the graph shows WB immunosignals normalized vs. young healthy controls\u2019 (W6) values to better reflect changes in distribution and configuration of \u03b1-syn in response to age and treatment. Therefore, the statistical significance refers to the magnitude of the relative change of \u03b1-syn amount vs. control. Actin immunoblotting bands are included as loading controls).   p   < 0.05, unpaired   t  -test with Welch\u2019s correction;   p   < 0.05, Two-way ANOVA with Fisher\u2019s LSD.   (C)   Percentage of aggregated \u03b1-syn vs. total \u03b1-syn.   p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6 (  N   = 4). \n  \n\n### pSer129 \u03b1-syn Phosphorylation Correlates With \u03b1-syn Oligomerization in NRs \n  \nPhosphorylation of \u03b1-syn at Ser129 has been associated with \u03b1-syn aggregation and Lewy bodies generation ( ;  ;  ). Given the aforementioned abundance of multimeric \u03b1-syn forms in Co and Md regions of MPTP and aged mice, we next analyzed \u03b1-syn phosphorylation at Ser129 in NRs of mice cohorts. \n\nNR fractions of the two brain areas of 6-months and 14-months old MPTP-treated mice (M6 and M14, respectively) and age-matched controls (W6 and W14, respectively) were used to double run on two-dimensional electrophoresis using pH 3-10 non-linear gradient strips. 2-D membranes were immunoblotted with anti-pSer129 \u03b1-syn antibody, and reblotted with anti \u03b1-syn (4D6 clone) antibody. \u03b1-syn was resolved in 4 predominant isoforms with calculated isoelectric points (p  I  ) of 5.0, 6.7, 7.2, and 8.4 in W6 NR pellets ( , arrows). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of \u03b1-syn isoforms pattern in neuronal membranes. The 5.0 p  I   form was the predominant \u03b1-syn isoform detected in NR pellets corresponding to monomeric \u03b1-syn (solid arrow). This isoform was attenuated as a result of MPTP and aging, in parallel with the increased accumulation of higher Mw \u03b1-syn isoforms (arrowheads). \n  \n (A)   2-D immunoblotting of non-raft (NR) fractions showing the pattern of isoforms of \u03b1-syn in the midbrain (Md) area of the experimental cohorts.   (B)   2-D immunoblotting of NR fractions showing the pattern of isoforms of \u03b1-syn in the cortical (Co) area of the experimental cohorts. Protein extracts of the distinct neuronal membrane fractions were processed for 2-D analyses, immunoblotted with an antibody against phospho-Ser129 \u03b1-syn (indicated as pSer), and reblotted with an antibody that recognized monomeric and high Mw \u03b1-syn forms. Isoelectric points were estimated for the native (solid arrow) and three other recurring forms (hollow arrows). High Mw, phospho-Ser \u03b1-syn isoforms were found in the M14 cohort and are highlighted (arrowheads). A summary of the molecular weight marker run in the gels is included for further reference (  N   = 4). \n  \nNR extracts were further processed for 2-D immunoblotting with anti-pSer129 \u03b1-syn antibody in order to evaluate the potential increase in \u03b1-syn phosphorylation related to protein oligomerization. We found the accumulation \u03b1-syn phosphorylated residues preferentially in high Mw forms of \u03b1-syn, especially in old mice treated with MPTP (arrowheads). Moreover, in particular in Md areas, the phosphorylated residues overlapped with \u03b1-syn multimeric forms ( , arrowheads). Interestingly, no pSer129 residues were detected in young healthy mice (W6). \n\nThese data suggest that pSer129 \u03b1-syn phosphorylation accumulates in \u03b1-syn oligomeric conformations of NR fractions. Indeed, the activation of \u03b1-syn phosphorylation appears to be related to brain aging and is exacerbated with MPTP-related neuropathology. \n\n\n### NMDAR2B and mGluR5 Membrane Redistribution in Response to Aging and Treatment \n  \nThe accumulation of \u03b1-syn oligomers was recently shown to cause synaptic impairment through a complex mechanism involving the ionotropic NMDAR2B and the metabotropic mGluR5 receptors, as well as a direct interaction with the prion protein ( ). This mechanism seems to be key for cognitive decline associated to synucleinopathies. Given our previous findings regarding \u03b1-synuclein, we next investigated the potential changes in NMDAR2B and mGluR5 in our experimental cohorts. We analyzed by slot-blot the presence of both receptors and optical density was normalized against flotillin-1. Although the data did not reach a standard level of significance (  p   = 0.08), both receptors showed lower levels in LRs of, both Co and Md regions following MPTP toxicity ( ). Slot-blotting was used for these analyses, due to the poor protein material generally extracted from LR fractions. It is worth mentioning that these findings were specific to these two, and no other, glutamatergic receptors. For instance, immunoblotting signals for the AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor 1, another ionotropic glutamatergic receptor, and mGluR1, a metabotropic receptor closely related to mGluR5, remained invariable in both fractions (data not shown). \n  \n (A)   Quantification of NMDAR2B (left) and mGluR5 (right) receptors as analyzed by slot-blot of lipid raft (LR) fractions of midbrain (Md) in our four experimental cohorts. Values were normalized vs. flotillin-1.   (B)   Quantification of NMDAR2B (left) and mGluR5 (right) receptors as analyzed by slot-blot of lipid raft (LR) fractions of cortex (Co) in our four experimental cohorts. Values were normalized vs. flotillin-1. One-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6 (  N   = 4). No significant differences were found between treated and saline littermates, or between young and aged animals. \n  \n\n### Membrane Redistribution of PrPc Associated With Aging and MPTP Treatment \n  \nPrPc is a GPI-anchored protein whose interaction with GM1 is crucial for the protein partitioning and conformation ( ). The distinct compartmentalization of \u03b1-syn and the glutamatergic receptors NMDAR2B and GluR5 observed related to age and neurotoxic parameters led us to analyze PrPc distribution in the membrane fractions. We performed Western blot analyses to establish PrPc levels in our experimental cohorts ( ). In addition, we included APP in our analysis as a relevant pathological comparison of other neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as AD ( ) ( ;  ). Interestingly, PrPc showed a striking decrease in cortical LR fractions following both aging and pharmacological injury as compared to young healthy controls ( ). Moreover, we observed a similar pattern in the distribution of APP and PrPc in the Md LRs of aged and MPTP-treated mice ( ). In contrast, PrPc was absent of NR fractions. \n  \n (A)   Western blot analysis of the expression of PrP in lipid rafts (since this protein was absent or only slightly represented in non-raft fractions) from the four experimental cohorts.   (B)   Quantification of total PrP levels in lipid rafts normalized versus W6. (  p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6).   (C)   Western blot analysis of the expression of APP in lipid rafts and non-raft fractions from the four experimental cohorts.   (D)   Quantification of total APP levels in non-raft fractions normalized vs. W6 (  N   = 4). \n  \n\n### Distinct Partitioning and Aggregation of \u03b1-syn in Membrane Fractions of PD Brains \n  \nWe further evaluated by immunoblotting \u03b1-syn distribution and conformation in membrane fractions from the frontal cortex of incidental Parkinson\u2019s disease (iPD) and PD brains. Age-matched healthy controls were used for comparison ( ). These samples had previously shown profound pathological changes in the lipid composition of LR (F1-F2) fractions and significant modifications in their physicochemical properties ( ;  ). Monomeric \u03b1-syn was shown highly abundant in LR from control samples. This protein was significantly observed to decrease in iPD and PD brains. On the contrary, monomeric \u03b1-syn was increased in NR fractions with the progression of the pathology ( ). \u03b1-Syn displacement to the non-raft fractions (F3-F6) remarkably correlated with an appearance of \u03b1-syn high Mw species (>65 kDa) of iPD and PD samples, as quantified by bar graphs normalized to control samples. \n  \n (A)   Comparative Western blot analysis of protein markers in LR (F1 and F2) and NR (F3 and F6) fractions of human frontal cortex from three experimental cohorts: control, incidental Parkinson\u2019s disease (iPD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Top: Samples were immunoblotted for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the prion protein (PrP) and the monomeric form of \u03b1-syn in lipid rafts. Flotillin was used as control of LR content. Bottom: Samples were immunoblotted for APP, and the monomeric, oligomeric and high Mw forms of the \u03b1-syn in non-raft fractions. Actin was used as a control.   (B)   Top: Quantification of APP, PrPc and the monomeric form of \u03b1-syn in lipid rafts. Bottom: Quantification of APP, and the monomeric, oligomeric and high Mw forms of \u03b1-syn in NR fractions. Proteins were quantified and normalized against flotillin in F1 and F2 (top) and against actin in F3 and F6 (bottom). (  p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. W6).   (C)   Quantification of fatty acids and lipid classes from lipid rafts in control humans and patients suffering incidental Parkinson\u2019s (iPD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) (adapted from  ). AA, DHA and oleic are expressed as average mole percentage \u00b1 statistical error, and ratios derived from them and other, not shown fatty acid species.   (D)   Cumulative mole percentage of arachidonic and docosahexanoic acids (AA and DHA, respectively), oleic acid and phosphatidylserine (PS) in lipid rafts from control humans and patients suffering iPD and PD. AA, DHA and oleic are expressed as average mole percentage \u00b1 statistical error.   p   < 0.05, One-way ANOVA with Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test vs. control (  N   = 5). \n  \nTo further characterize the putative partitioning of other synuclein pathological protein biomarkers of the study, we examined the presence of PrPc and APP in these membrane compartments ( ). The immunoblotting results on the same experimental samples revealed a progressive reduction of PrPc content in F1-F2 that correlated with PD pathology. PrPc was undetected in NR pellets (data not shown). Moreover, APP showed a shifting to NR in both iPD and PD subjects as compared to healthy controls. \n\nWe have previously demonstrated a highly significant detriment in PUFA (AA + DHA) and oleic acid levels that correlated with an unbalanced UI ( ). For further clarification, these values are succinctly summarized in  . Based upon our data, we analyzed whether the progressive reduction in monomeric \u03b1-syn observed in cortical LR with the progression of PD correlated with the combinatorial variations in the levels of the main lipid factors reported to affect \u03b1-syn configuration at the neuronal membrane ( ). Interestingly, the accumulated variations of AA, DHA, oleic acid and PS accounted for \u223c49% of total lipid changes in iPD as compared with age-matched controls. Although not conclusively demonstrated here, this lipid species rearrangement may be a factor contributing to \u03b1-syn insertion in these membrane microstructures. \n\nOverall, these observations indicate that the distribution of \u03b1-syn in membranous compartments differs during aging and following MPTP neurotoxicity. Furthermore, pathological impairment of lipid microenvironment may also affect membrane partitioning of other raft-associated proteins involved in distinct proteinopathies, such as glutamatergic receptors, PrPc and APP. A schematic representation of the dynamics of these membrane proteins in the PD pathological scenario has been illustrated in  . \n  \nA hypothetical model of lipid raft alterations and their functional and structural consequences. Diverse stimuli may affect the strictly regulated chemical composition of the lipid raft microdomains, altering their physicochemical properties and facilitating pathological changes in proteins such as glutamatergic receptors, PrPc and APP. These molecular anomalies in neuronal lipid rafts may promote changes in the aggregation and phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein associated with PD pathology. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIncreasing evidence indicates that cell membrane microdomains with a specific, well-regulated lipid and protein composition such as LR may be essential for neuronal health. Even minor alterations in these structures can trigger pathological effects by modifying the way lipids and proteins interact, thereby affecting neurotoxic and neuroprotective responses. Indeed, our previous studies have demonstrated that instability of raft microdomains appears to be a crucial early event in the development of synucleinopathies ( ;  ,  ). In this sense, a plausible hypothesis is that the membrane lipid microenvironment may determine the modulation and trafficking of distinct \u03b1-syn molecular configurations. To explore this issue, we have investigated here the putative molecular alterations of distinct membrane lipid fractions, LR and NR, and their subsequent impact on \u03b1-syn dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that rearrangement of membrane gangliosides, PUFA, Cho, SFA and phospholipids induced by brain aging and PD injury have profound effects on \u03b1-syn distribution and oligomerization in abnormal structures. Furthermore, these changes in protein trafficking may be extended to other biomarkers related to neurodegenerative diseases, such as PrPc, APP and glutamatergic receptors. \n\nWe used a well-established murine model of PD ( ;  ;  ;  ). This paradigm is based on the loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc and consequent motor deficits following MPTP neurotoxin administration ( ;  ). In line with previous observations ( ;  ), we detected here a significant decline of TH-IR neurons in the SNpc of MPTP-treated mice. Similarly, a significant TH-IR loss was shown in SNpc of untreated 14-months aged mice as compared to 6-months aged ones. These observations reflect a potential progressive detriment of dopaminergic activity in this brain area caused by mere aging. This mouse phenotype is in agreement with previous studies of age-dependent changes in gene expression that have suggested the existence of an accelerated detriment of SNpc in aged mice ( ), and a loss of TH-IR neurons and dopamine production in old animals ( ). \n\nIn the present study, lipid analyses of membrane fractionation in midbrain (Md) and cortex (Co) from MPTP-treated animals reflected alterations in representative lipid classes of these brain regions, including impairment in distinct ganglioside species. Noticeably, gangliosides have been implicated as regulators of \u03b1-syn pathology ( ;  ), and binding of this protein to GM1 inhibits fibrillation ( ). In this work, we did not observe a significant unbalance of GM1 present in raft fractions following MPTP treatment. However, we observed anomalies in the levels of other ganglioside species (GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b), in particular in aged mice exposed to MPTP. Although the influence of GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b on \u03b1-syn membrane regulation has been little explored ( ), these data indicate that, apart from GM1, the specific rearrangement of other ganglioside lipid classes may participate in the partitioning and conformational structure of \u03b1-syn. For instance, folding of this protein is enhanced by distinct gangliosides in a specific manner ( ). \n\nTogether with ganglioside species, we detected here a disproportion of PUFA, Cho, SFAs and phospholipids ratio during aging that were accelerated by MPTP injury. Indeed, comparison of the lipid bundles collected from membranous compartments evidenced a conversed variation in the levels of these lipid classes induced by aging and neurotoxicity. For instance, the standard proportions of Cho/PUFA, PL/PUFA and Cho/PUFA showed downward trends in LR but significant upward variations in NR. Treated animals also displayed significant changes in total polar lipids (mainly phospholipids, PL) which varied steadily with age and phenotype, in particular in NR fractions. Moreover, SFA/PUFA ratio was highly unbalanced as compared to the healthy young cohort used as control. In parallel with these changes, the UI was particularly reduced in aged animals. This phenomenon may directly influence the ability of neuron membranes to buffer oxidative insult associated with neurotoxicity. Furthermore, UI detriment indicates the presence of a more viscous and liquid-ordered microstructures in MPTP animals ( ), a phenomenon that may affect protein configuration and dynamics of protein assemblies embedded in these lipid matrices, including \u03b1-syn. The fact that neurotoxic treatment affected membrane microdomain stability even in 6-month age cohort indicates that these structural changes may be at the basis of abnormal molecular aberrations. Nevertheless, membrane impairment under pathological conditions may reach a maximal physicochemical limit that may be counteracted by aging as the main component of neuronal dysfunction. \n\nPrevious data has revealed that polyunsaturated acyl groups, in particular AA and DHA, can induce multimerization of \u03b1-syn in phospholipid vesicles ( ). Taking into account the considerable variation of these PUFA in membrane compartments induced by MPTP treatment, we further characterized whether these molecular fluctuations may generate the basis for \u03b1-syn oligomerization. Binding affinity of \u03b1-syn to lipid microdomains requires the combination of PUFA (AA or DHA), oleic acid and PS ( ). In our work, levels of PS, and no other phospholipids, were shown to be profoundly affected by MPTP toxicity in both midbrain and cortex from NR extracts. More interestingly, as compared to other lipid subsets, the molecular combination of PS with AA, DHA and oleic acid accounted for \u223c60% of the total NR lipid matrix associated with MPTP lesion. The requirement for both mono- and polyunsaturated acyl chains indicates that \u03b1-syn configuration may strongly depend on a particular biphasic transition to facilitate protein-lipid interactions. It is worth mentioning that, even if Cho is a main component for raft stability, this sterol does not appear to be a main factor for specific binding and modification of \u03b1-syn by raft lipid clustering ( ). Even though some reports have claimed that high Cho causes the accumulation of \u03b1-syn in PD ( ;  ), other studies have demonstrated that there is not a direct link between Cho levels and PD development ( ;  ). These apparent controversies may be explained by alteration in the local architecture of membrane microdomains caused by trafficking of distinct lipid species. In this order of ideas, Cho is preferentially located in the exofacial leaflet of the membrane and shows a poor affinity for DHA. It has been proposed that even subtle changes in PUFA content may have profound consequences in membrane order and fluidity, phase behavior and the dynamic partitioning of proteins embedded in this microenvironment ( ;  ). These changes may indeed account for the specific association of \u03b1-syn with membranous compartments, thereby altering its configuration. At another level, \u03b1-syn may also in reverse influence the structural and functioning of lipid stability of membranes, thereby enhancing abnormal lipid rearrangement that may potentiate the neurotoxic effect ( ;  ). In this sense, \u03b1-syn knock-out mice exhibit increased levels of PUFA by still unknown mechanistic strategies ( ). \n\nRelated to the cerebellum, some lipid changes were also observed, associated with alterations in both Cho and PUFA levels. However, as expected, most changes in this region were associated with aging rather than to neurotoxin exposure. Noticeably, induction of MPTP neurotoxicity requires the expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) to access intracellular compartments ( ;  ). In this sense, cerebellar neurons are deprived of DAT in these mice and, therefore, may be resistant to MPTP injury (unpublished results). Furthermore, lipid matrix imbalance in membrane microstructures related to MPTP phenotype closely resembles those previously reported by our group in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a model of AD degeneration. In these mice, Cho and PUFA disproportion, together with a lower unsaturation capability, were also reported with the progression of aging and AD pathology ( ). More remarkable, profound changes in cortical microdomains have been previously observed by our group in human synucleopathies, such as PD and DLB. In LR from human cortex, DHA (22:6n-3), AA (20:4n-6) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) were shown to be significantly reduced even at the preamble of these diseases, in parallel with an increase in SFA (16:0 and 18:0) ( ). Likewise, accelerated LR aging has been previously characterized in early stages of human AD brains, consistently observing similar changes in PUFA/SFA ratio with the progression of the pathology ( ). Overall, these data indicate that PD-like lesion accelerates the normal aging process of lipid changes in cognitive and motor brain areas, provoking a premature triggering of neuropathological membrane features. \n\nOur present proteomic analyses of \u03b1-syn in experimental mice cohorts revealed the accumulation of high MW forms of this protein in the three nerve regions analyzed during aging and toxic treatment. \u03b1-syn multimers were particularly abundant in cortical NR compartments, although they were also visible in Md areas. Conversely, the amount of this protein was negligible in raft fractions, where only a faint representation of monomeric \u03b1-syn was detected in young healthy controls. The high Mw \u03b1-syn aggregates found here have also been previously detected in the \u03b1-syn E57K transgenic mice ( ). However, other alternative rearrangements of the protein may be expected considering the exceedingly complex nature of \u03b1-syn biochemistry ( ). Additionally, \u03b1-syn monomers were also detected in NR fractions. These monomeric forms have been previously described in normal mammalian cells, and represent \u03b1-syn native, metastable physiological forms of the protein ( ;  ). It is worth mentioning that other cognitive areas not investigated here, such as the hippocampus, may also be affected by MPTP treatment. Thus, recent data has demonstrated the correlation between the post-translational modification and accumulation of membrane-associated \u03b1-syn with impaired hippocampal plasticity ( ). \n\nInterestingly, \u03b1-synuclein oligomers have been found in exosomes which are membrane nanovesicles secreted by cells, in the central nervous system ( ). Together with recent biophysical findings that toxic \u03b1-syn oligomerization reduces the ability of this protein to interact with lipid membranes depending upon their chemical composition ( ), this would suggest a potential spreading mechanism for multimeric \u03b1-synuclein isoforms with pathological relevance. Furthermore, MPTP phenotype may also increase lipid peroxidation at the membrane ( ) by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I ( ;  ) and inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ). These cellular events may ultimately affect the stability of the monomeric \u03b1-syn membrane binding, thus facilitating oligomerization and modifying protein homeostasis. \n\nIn contrast with mice membranes, our data showed a high abundance of monomeric \u03b1-syn in raft domains from the human frontal cortex. However, this protein was largely diminished in cortical areas of both iPD and PD brains as compared to age-matched healthy controls. Interestingly, concomitant with monomeric \u03b1-syn reduction, we detected the appearance of high Mw \u03b1-syn aggregates in a similar pattern to MPTP-treated mice. Multimerization of this protein occurred in parallel with its trafficking to NR fractions of the pathological subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of \u03b1-syn multimeric distribution related to raft membrane compartments. Interestingly, \u03b1-syn multimer pattern may be common in different synucleopathies, as aggregated forms of this protein were also detected in the frontal cortex of cases with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) ( ). DLB is another synucleinopathy characterized by widespread \u03b1-syn deposition in different brain regions, including cortical areas ( ;  ;  ). Although still little explored, \u03b1-syn aggregation in DLB may also be a consequence of the loss of this protein bound to LRs due to lipid constraints ( ). Overall, these data are an indicative of the compartmentalization of this protein in NRs related to synucleinopathies, correlating with the lipid impairment observed in membrane microdomains ( ;  ). In agreement with this, previous studies have demonstrated that selective lipid loading determines the initial phases of \u03b1-syn aggregation, specifically dimers and trimers, providing the core seed for further complex aggregation ( ). This is particularly interesting when considering the trends observed in glutamatergic receptors after MPTP treatment in murine subjects. Previous studies have found that \u03b1-syn regulates both membrane NMDA levels and the internalization of NMDA receptors ( ;  ). Furthermore, the rotenone toxin, which impairs mitochondrial function in a way analog to MPTP treatment, has been reported to induce a decrease in NMDA2B levels ( ). Altogether, these findings suggest a role of the aforementioned selective lipid loading in the regulation of glutamatergic membrane receptors via the preservation of monomeric \u03b1-syn. This molecular mechanism may be potentially take part in the PD pathogenesis when lipid content is altered thus enhanced protein multimerization. \n\nAnother consequence of altered structure of lipid microstructures during PD neuropathology is that it may provide the molecular environment for further toxic \u03b1-syn phosphorylation. For instance, phosphorylation in S129 residue (pS129) has been found highly represented in \u03b1-syn aggregates of various synucleinopathies ( ). In this work, 2-D immunoblotting assays to detect pS129 \u03b1-syn demonstrated that this phosphorylated form was mainly present in NRs of aged mice. This fact was reflected by the increase in the number of recurring high Mw isoforms with distinctive p  I   (6.7\u20138.4) observed by immunoblotting. To our knowledge, this represents the first illustration of \u03b1-syn pattern of post-transductional modification in membrane fractions. A similar phosphorylation trend was also observed in young mice exposed to PD-like neurotoxicity. Moreover, as expected, a significant reduction of p  I   5.0 isoform corresponding to the unmodified \u03b1-syn monomer ( ;  ) was detected in aged brains. Thus, \u03b1-syn presence in NR membrane fractions may involve pS129 \u03b1-syn enhancement in correlation with \u03b1-syn aggregation production. These results reflect that \u03b1-syn phosphorylation in this residue is age-dependent, according to local microenvironmental changes. Thus, pS129 \u03b1-syn appears to correlate with lipid alterations occurring following MPTP injury, further evidencing the coordination of \u03b1-syn processing with neuronal membrane lipid homeostasis ( ). Moreover, although not explored in this work, other post-translational modifications of \u03b1-syn, including phosphorylation at Ser87 and Tyr 125 may also be involved in \u03b1-syn toxic assemblies ( ). \n\nMounting evidence suggests that the key self-aggregating proteins in different proteinopathies, such as A\u03b2, PrPc and \u03b1-syn may share similar biophysical properties that affect the biochemical interrelations with membrane-integrated molecular compounds ( ;  ;  ). In this sense, LR platforms are considered key sites in the modulation of amyloid-like seeding of several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD ( ;  ). In the present study, in parallel with the shifting of monomeric \u03b1-syn from LR to NR microstructures, we also observed the decrease of PrPc with the progression of PD in both mice and human samples. Aging process also modified the compartmentalization of PrPc. This is in correlation with previous data where a decrease of PrPc was reported during human aging and AD-related neurodegeneration ( ). However, PrPc trafficking behavior may be region-dependent, as other data have reported a slight increase of this protein in the hippocampus of aged mice ( ). These apparent discrepancies may be explained by functional differences between brain regions. \n\nAn interesting recent finding is that \u03b1-syn and PrPc markers appear to be interacting in the neuronal membrane ( ). In our experiments, we did not observe a significant interaction of these two markers in raft samples, most probably due to the small amount of protein content represented in the membrane isolates (data not shown). The fact that these two protein markers follow a similar detriment in mice and human LRs suggests that lipid disturbances correlating with aging and PD neurotoxicity may affect interactions between these proteins. We postulate that a key lipid species in the pathological behavior of both PrPc and \u03b1-syn at the cell surface may be GM1. PrPc binding to this ganglioside is a prerequisite in the mechanisms predisposing to neuropathology ( ). GM1 also promotes toxic \u03b1-syn oligomerization ( ) although other ganglioside species may also be involved ( ). Furthermore, clustering of amyloidogenic proteins may enhance toxic cross-seeding. Thus, scrapie PrP and A\u03b2 have been shown to seed the formation of \u03b1-syn cytosolic aggregates in transgenic mouse models ( ;  ), a phenomenon that may drive disease progression. Also, \u03b1-syn and tau interactions at the cellular level appear to contribute to both tauopathies and synucleinopathies, indicating a synergistic effect between these two protein associations in the progression of the pathological features of these diseases ( ;  ;  ). \n\nMoreover, other proteins clustering in raft multimeric associations may be affected by changes in membrane microstructures related to cognitive and motor impairment. For instance, \u03b1-syn/PrPc interaction is required to induce synaptic impairment through the activation of glutamatergic receptors ( ;  ). We analyzed the distribution of APP and glutamatergic receptors in different LR and NR samples in this study. Interestingly, we detected a reduction of both NMDAR2B and mGluR5 correlating with aging and PD-like in mice. In addition, APP followed a similar shifting to NR fractions in PD brains. This protein redistribution may be a consequence of raft architecture rearrangements that may favor the amyloidogenic cleavage of APP ( ). Overall, these data support the complexity of \u03b1-syn interactions to multiple partners within plasma membrane compartments, a fact that may affect disease-related events. \n\nOverall, our data provide a further insight into the microenvironmental changes occurring during age and synucleinopathy toxicity taking place in distinct plasma membrane compartments. Alterations in the lipid matrix of raft membrane compartments may enhance \u03b1-syn trafficking, concomitantly with an enhancement of toxic conformational rearrangement and increased phosphorylation. The aberrant lipid modifications in raft architecture may promote the rearrangement of other pathologically relevant protein species, such as PrPc, glutamatergic receptors and APP that may ultimately contribute to neuronal impairment. In an attempt to illustrate this potential molecular scenario, we have depicted a schematic representation of the different markers analyzed here ( ). \n\nFurther studies will be required to investigate the implication of self-aggregated proteins such as \u03b1-syn and other PD-linked proteins in neuronal LR, and the manner these membrane microstructures may be involved in both neuronal preservation and the pathogenesis of PD. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations and guidelines set by the European Union (86/609/UE) and in accordance with the current legal regulation of Spain Ley 32/2007, RD 53/2013, Ley 9/2003 y RD 178/2004).

Classic electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of WPW include short PR interval, slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, and prolonged QRS duration. However,\u00a0in intermittent preexcitation, a rare variant in contrast to continuous preexcitation, these findings are not always present, thus masking a diagnosis of WPW syndrome. Consequently, this may adversely affect or delay the appropriate treatment of short-term tachyarrhythmias and long-term definitive therapies for this syndrome. The emergency physician should\u00a0promptly obtain an ECG after the termination of any tachyarrhythmia, and maintain a high index of suspicion for intermittent preexcitation\u00a0with typical WPW ECG findings which\u00a0were\u00a0not\u00a0present on prior studies.\u00a0The authors present a case of a 17-year-old female diagnosed with an intermittent preexcitation variant of WPW syndrome after a case of successfully treated symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a form of electrical preexcitation caused by a congenital accessory pathway known as the \u201cBundle of Kent\u201d, which bypasses normal atrioventricular (AV) nodal and His Purkinje conduction system regulation. With a predilection for males most commonly presenting in the third decade of life, this preexcitation syndrome may lead to potentially lethal arrhythmias due to unregulated electrical impulse conduction between the cardiac atria and ventricles [ , ]. Classic ECG findings of WPW include a shortened PR interval of less than 120 milliseconds, a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex referred to as the delta wave, and a widened QRS greater than 110 milliseconds [ ]. This ECG pattern has been estimated at one to three\u00a0individuals per 1,000 persons; however, the pattern alone is far more common in asymptomatic individuals than those with associated cardiac arrhythmias secondary to the accessory pathway, marking the diagnosis of true WPW syndrome [ ]. One cohort study revealed a rate of tachyarrhythmias as 1.0% per year of individuals with WPW pattern [ ]. In the pediatric population of\u00a06 to 20 years old, the prevalence of WPW syndrome was less than 0.07% [ ]. While atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) may comprise the majority of tachyarrhythmias in WPW, atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter occur in approximately 20% and 7% of WPW patients, respectively [ ]. \n\n\n## Case presentation \n  \nA 17-year-old female with past medical history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and one episode of SVT two months earlier presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of palpitations at rest. Initial vital signs included heart rate of 200 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/63 mm Hg, 18 breaths per minute (bpm) and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. While the patient appeared uncomfortable, she was speaking in full sentences and reported that symptoms were consistent with her previous episode of SVT. An ECG confirmed SVT (Figure  ). After unsuccessful vagal maneuvers, 6 mg of IV\u00a0adenosine was rapidly administered, followed by rapid administration of 10 milliliters of 0.9% normal saline, demonstrating successful conversion to sinus rhythm on repeat ECG (Figure  ). However, this ECG revealed WPW morphology including short PR interval (100 milliseconds), delta wave, and mildly prolonged QRS (117 milliseconds). The patient reported resolution of symptoms, and repeat vital signs were normal. Laboratory values and chest radiograph were unremarkable. Given the concern for a new diagnosis of WPW, pediatric cardiology was consulted and confirmed the new diagnosis of WPW.\u00a0Upon a more thorough review of the patient's medical records, an\u00a0ECG obtained after the termination of her initial episode of SVT\u00a0from two months after prior was retrieved which did not show evidence of WPW, supporting the diagnosis of intermittent preexcitation (Figure  ). The patient was prescribed oral atenolol at 25 milligrams twice daily\u00a0in conjunction with\u00a0short-term pediatric cardiology clinic follow-up, and did not return to the emergency department\u00a0within the next 30 days. Due to the side effects from atenolol, the patient and her family elected to discontinue the medication and instead, opted for cardiac catheter ablation. \n   Initial electrocardiogram demonstrating supraventricular tachycardia with diffuse ST segment depressions (black arrows)       Electrocardiogram obtained after resolution of supraventricular tachycardia, demonstrating normal sinus rhythm with short PR interval, wide QRS duration, and delta waves (black arrows)       Electrocardiogram obtained after resolution of initial episode of supraventricular tachycardia two months prior, demonstrating normal sinus rhythm with intervals within normal limits    \n\n## Discussion \n  \nDue to temporary accessory pathway activation, the true prevalence of intermittent preexcitation in WPW syndrome may be underreported as a result of protean ECG evidence supportive of the diagnosis. Multiple studies have suggested an approximate 13% prevalence of intermittent preexcitation in the pediatric WPW syndrome population [ , ]. Orthodromic AVRT\u00a0is\u00a0a particular subtype of SVT accounting for up to 95% of reentrant tachycardias in WPW patients, caused by anterograde conduction along the AV node with retrograde conduction along the accessory pathway [ , ]. Orthodromic AVRT and other forms of SVT including atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) share many electrocardiographic characteristics.\u00a0While electrophysiologic\u00a0studies (EPS)\u00a0are required to definitively distinguish AVRT from AVNRT, ECG markers which may indicate orthodromic AVRT include a heart rate typically between 200 and 300 beats per minute, QRS duration of less than 120 milliseconds, ST depressions, T wave inversions, and retrograde P waves [ ]. Figure   displays a rate of nearly 200 beats per minute, a narrow QRS complex, and ST segment depressions, though these may also be demonstrated in typical SVT rhythms. Similarly, ST depressions reflect demand ischemia at these rapid heart rates, which further adds difficulty in attempting to differentiate orthodromic AVRT from other forms of SVT.\u00a0While immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated in any hemodynamically unstable patient in acute arrhythmia, adenosine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for the treatment of otherwise stable patients with multiple forms of SVT, including orthodromic AVRT with WPW syndrome [ , ]. Thus, if vagal maneuvers are unsuccessful, rapid administration of IV adenosine remains first-line medication treatment for termination of this arrhythmia [ ]. After termination of the arrhythmia, the typical ECG characteristics were apparent, likely due to residual preexcitation. While the time between the termination of the patient\u2019s first episode of SVT and her repeat normal ECG is not known, minimizing the delay between SVT termination and repeat ECG may have been essential to make the intermittent preexcitation WPW diagnosis. Fortunately, patients with intermittent preexcitation have less frequent episodes of SVT over time in comparison with those with continuous preexcitation [ ]. \n\nA myriad of other tachyarrhythmias may occur in WPW syndrome. Far less common than orthodromic AVRT, antidromic AVRT may also occur at an incidence of 5% of WPW patients [ ]. Procainamide, a class 1A antiarrhythmic medication that acts by\u00a0inhibiting cardiac myocyte sodium channels,\u00a0is an appropriate medical treatment option in otherwise stable antidromic AVRT patients, though electrical cardioversion stands as another reasonable treatment option [ , ]. Rarely, WPW may lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to atrial fibrillation and subsequent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, accounting for 0.0%-0.6% deaths per WPW patient per year [ ]. Fortunately, in intermittent preexcitation, patients generally have a longer refractory period and a decreased conductive accessory pathway between the atria and the ventricles [ ]. This is considered a relatively protective factor, as AF is less likely to initiate a sustained ventricular tachycardia, subsequent ventricular fibrillation with resulting SCD [ ]. However, administering AV nodal blocking agents such as adenosine and verapamil during AF in WPW is contraindicated, as this may preferentially direct the current through the accessory pathway, causing iatrogenic decompensation. Procainamide,\u00a0as previously mentioned, is\u00a0the first-line medical therapy for stable patients\u00a0with\u00a0ibutilide, a class 3 antiarrhythmic medication that primarily inhibits\u00a0potassium channels,\u00a0being a reasonable alternative [ , ].\u00a0However, electrical cardioversion may ultimately be warranted [ , ]. Even in an otherwise stable WPW patient with a tachyarrhythmia of uncertain rhythm, synchronized cardioversion may be an appropriate, and potentially safest treatment option. \n\nPatients with a suspected diagnosis of WPW necessitate cardiology referral. Specifically, electrophysiology cardiology physicians may confirm the diagnosis of an\u00a0accessory pathway and strategize future treatments through EPS. According to 2015 expert guidelines, catheter ablation, a\u00a0procedure performed by\u00a0electrophysiology cardiologists,\u00a0is first-line treatment for individuals who have ever experienced symptomatic SVT to include orthodromic AVRT, as this definitive therapy is both safe and effective [ ].\u00a0Alternatively, a number of medical therapies, including beta-blockers are available to suppress episodes of SVT including orthodromic AVRT [ ].\u00a0In the emergency department setting, after the termination of an acute tachyarrhythmia, certain\u00a0asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable patients may be discharged from the emergency department after otherwise reassuring workup and\u00a0short term observation. However, this decision\u00a0should be made in conjunction with cardiology to not only ensure optimal disposition, but also to\u00a0expedite needed\u00a0inpatient or\u00a0outpatient testing and treatment. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe emergency physician should suspect a diagnosis of\u00a0intermittent preexcitation\u00a0with characteristic WPW findings on ECG not\u00a0appreciated on prior\u00a0studies in patients who have experienced tachyarrhythmias.\u00a0While difficult to diagnose given the very low prevalence and fleeting ECG evidence of an accessory pathway, promptly obtaining ECG studies after acute arrhythmia termination may not only establish a diagnosis of intermittent preexcitation variant of WPW but also guide both short and long term therapy.\u00a0Though\u00a0intermittent preexcitation is less predisposing to both\u00a0benign and malignant arrhythmias in comparison to continuous preexcitation,\u00a0consultation with cardiology in the emergency department is appropriate for both disposition and treatment planning. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7398740, "text_md5": "1eadaec75aee0eca4a90e42e7b114cf2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 105], "journal": [106, 112], "publication_year": [114, 118], "title": [129, 237], "keywords": [251, 329], "abstract": [342, 1452], "body": [1461, 11318]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32766013, "doi": "10.7759/cureus.8971", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7398740", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7398740"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7398740\">7398740</a>", "list_title": "PMC7398740  Hide and Seek: Intermittent Preexcitation Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome Case Report and Management Overview"}

In a young patient, WCT causing syncope raises suspicion of an underlying life-threatening arrhythmia. Identifying the aetiology is essential to provide appropriate treatment.  We report the case of a young patient with WCT of unknown aetiology who finally underwent an electrophysiological (EP) study leading to the diagnosis of Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) syndrome. \n\n\n## Timeline \n    \n\n## Case presentation \n  \nA 22-year-old male was admitted to our electrophysiology department for an EP study. For more than 10 years, he had been experiencing WCT (   ) of unclear aetiology leading to syncope. An EP study had been offered at different times but was rejected. The patient\u2019s parents who were taking medical decisions at that time were very reluctant towards an EP study as they were afraid of procedure-related complications. However, in view of the potentially life-threatening event (after a first syncope while exercising 4\u2009years earlier), the parents accepted implantation of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD; SX-RX 1010, Cameron Health Inc.) in 2013. Since ICD implantation, multiple WCT episodes were recorded and shocked by the device ( ). Most episodes developed when exercising. During the episodes, he experienced dizziness, rapid heartbeats, heavy sweating, and intense fear. Otherwise, he reported hardly any physical complaints, but over time felt highly restricted in his daily living because of the fear of receiving shocks at any moment. The patient had no other pre-existing medical conditions and denied use of alcohol and illicit drugs. The only medication he was taking on a regular basis was the beta-adrenergic blocking agent bisoprolol (2.5\u2009mg bid). His family history was unremarkable with respect to sudden cardiac death (SCD), cardiac arrhythmias, or channelopathies. Accordingly, electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from both parents were unremarkable. Exercise stress tests and Holter ECGs were performed without significant findings. A genetic testing had been scheduled but was not attended. He had undergone magnetic resonance imaging in 2013 with no evidence of a structural heart disease, in particular no signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. \n  \nTwelve-lead electrocardiogram recorded in 2013 showed a wide complex tachycardia with right bundle branch block-shaped wide QRS complexes with intermittent narrow QRS complexes (C, capture beats). \n  \nAfter several years of receiving numerous ICD shocks, the patient felt increasingly frustrated with his situation. As a 22-year-old adult, he came back to the suggestion of an EP study and gave his consent. \n\nPhysical examination on the day of admission revealed no significant findings and lab values were normal apart from mild hypokalaemia. An ECG was recorded showing sinus bradycardia without signs of pre-excitation, ST-segment alterations, or a prolongation of the QT interval ( ). Echocardiography displayed a normal left ventricular systolic function. \n\nThe patient underwent an EP study on the following day. Intracardiac electrogram tracings [coronary sinus (CS) 1/2] during sinus rhythm revealed premature ventricular activation of the lateral mitral annulus (   ). This initial finding indicated the presence of a left-sided accessory atrioventricular pathway (AP). Accordingly, direct pacing at CS 1/2 produced an increasing degree of pre-excitation ( ). Rate incremental ventricular pacing resulted in a distal to proximal atrial activation sequence with the earliest site of atrial activation at the distal CS due to a non-decremental conduction of the AP (   ). The anterograde effective refractory period of the AP was defined as the longest basic cycle length which failed to conduct with pre-excitation and yielded 240\u2009ms in the patient indicating an AP with an increased risk of SCD. Ultimately, orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) without aberrancy and a cycle length of 316\u2009ms (   ) was induced. Neither atrial fibrillation (AF) nor a WCT were inducible during the EP study. \n  \nSurface electrocardiogram and electrogram tracings of the coronary sinus indicated pre-excitation with the earliest site of atrioventricular conduction in the lateral mitral annulus (coronary sinus 1/2, asterisk). A, atrial potential; V, ventricular potential. \n    \nRate-incremental ventricular pacing lead to a distal to proximal atrial activation sequence with the earliest atrial signal at the lateral mitral annulus (coronary sinus 1/2, asterisk) due to decremental conduction in the atrioventricular node (arrow). A, atrial potential; CS, coronary sinus; V, ventricular potential. \n    \nVentricular pacing with a cycle length of 290\u2009ms resulted in an orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia with a cycle length of 316\u2009ms. The onset is indicated by an asterisk. A, atrial potential; CS, coronary sinus; RVA, right ventricular apex; V, ventricular potential. \n  \nUsing a retrograde transaortic approach, the AP was localized using a mapping catheter by displaying the earliest ventricular activation in pre-excited sinus rhythm. Electroanatomic mapping denoted activation of the left ventricle by conduction via the AP as well as impulse propagation (  Video 1  ). Radiofrequency energy was delivered at the site of earliest ventricular activation at the lateral mitral annulus (CS 1/2), resulting in disappearance of pre-excitation (   ). Programmed ventricular stimulation did not induce ventricular tachycardia (VT). \n  \nMapping of the atrioventricular pathway was achieved by displaying the earliest ventricular activation. Applying radiofrequency energy, the atrioventricular pathway was successfully eliminated (arrow). Note that following ablation, the ventricular signal on both the mapping catheter (Map 1/2) and the distal coronary sinus (1/2) occurs after the onset of the QRS. A, atrial potential; CS, coronary sinus; RVA, right ventricular apex; V, ventricular potential. \n  \nFollow-up on the day after the procedure revealed no complications and the patient was discharged without medications. An appointment for the ICD explantation was scheduled to take place 3 months after the EP procedure. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn WPW syndrome, pre-excitation may not always be evident on ECG, potentially obscuring the presence of an AP.  We present the case of a young patient experiencing haemodynamically significant WCT in whom the presence of an AP became evident only after undergoing an EP study which was initially refused. \n\nWhile the prevalence of pre-excitation on ECG is reported to range from 0.1% to 0.3%,  it is not exactly clear how frequently an AP is existent without being manifest on ECG, given that the majority of patients remains asymptomatic.  Pre-excitation may be very subtle or inapparent if atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction is faster than conduction via the AP. This is especially true for left (lateral) APs as seen in our case (  Video   ) favouring AV nodal conduction. \n\nWide complex tachycardia in the presence of an AP can be due to the following: AF/atrial flutter with conduction via the AP; antidromic AVRT; orthodromic AVRT with a bundle branch block; VT; and other forms.  Interestingly, AF is present in nearly one-third of patients with a WPW syndrome. If an AP with a short anterograde refractory period is present (as seen in our patient), AF can result in fast ventricular rates potentially degenerating into ventricular fibrillation and leading to SCD. Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia might also degenerate into AF.  Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia by itself, in contrast, is usually well tolerated  and coexisting VT is very uncommon, especially if no structural heart disease is present.  Accordingly, VT was not inducible during the EP study. \n\nIn retrospect, it is hard to determine the underlying WCT mechanism (   ) in the patient. In synopsis of the above considerations, AF either occurring spontaneously or as a result of degeneration from preceding AVRT with rapid conduction to the ventricles over the AP appears to be the most plausible mechanism. In this context, the \u2018capture beat\u2019 seen in the WCT (   ) is highly interesting. We assume that it represents an atrial activation that was conducted by the AV node while the AP was refractory. Alternatively, it might represent a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) fused with an activation conducted by the AP. Given the comparatively narrow morphology of the capture beat, the PVC would have to be parahisian or arise from the right ventricle. In the latter case, the PVC from the right ventricle would coincidentally occur at the same time as activation via the AP, creating something like a spontaneous resynchronization. In summary, in our case the \u2018capture beat\u2019 that is a finding normally strongly indicative of VT was one of the factors triggering the wrong diagnosis of VT. \n\nWe would also like to highlight the importance of the EP study itself in our patient. Only after undergoing the EP study, the presence of an AP became evident and the diagnosis WPW syndrome was made. The AP was successfully targeted within the same procedure (   ). Success rates of AP ablation have been reported to be as high as 95%, while recurrence is seen in <5% of cases.  Procedure-related complications are rare.  In contrast, medical therapy of WPW syndrome, which includes numerous antiarrhythmics targeting the AV node, AP, or both, is moderately successful. Medical therapy is often used only after the onset of tachycardia to terminate it and is further limited by side effects.  Of note, AF can resolve following successful elimination of the AP.  VT being the most common aetiology of WCT overall is also amenable to ablation.  Performing the EP study at an earlier point, at the latest perioperatively just before ICD implantation, would have prevented the ICD implantation and subsequently the occurrence of many unpleasant shocks. \n\nIn conclusion, in young patients without structural heart disease experiencing WCT, performing an EP study seems mandatory to make a final diagnosis before implanting an ICD. Various aetiologies including an AP or VT might effectively be treated using catheter ablation, thus rendering ICD implantation unnecessary. \n\n\n## Lead author biography \n    \nStefan Preisend\u00f6rfer is a resident of cardiology at the German Heart Center in Munich, Germany.

Recently, it has been shown that Roco proteins belong to the family of G-proteins activated by nucleotide (nt)-dependent dimerization (GADs). We investigated the RocCOR tandem from the bacteria   Chlorobium tepidum   with site-directed spin labelling and pulse EPR distance measurements to follow conformational changes during the Roco G-protein cycle. Our results confirm that the COR domains are a stable dimerization device serving as a scaffold for the Roc domains that, in contrast, are structurally heterogeneous and dynamic entities. Contrary to other GAD proteins, we observed only minor structural alterations upon binding and hydrolysis of GTP, indicating significant mechanistic variations within this protein class. Mutations in the most prominent member of the Roco family of proteins, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) kinase 2 (LRRK2), are the most frequent cause of late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Using a stable recombinant LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase fragment we obtained detailed kinetic data for the G-protein cycle. Our data confirmed that dimerization is essential for efficient GTP hydrolysis and PD mutations in the Roc domain result in decreased GTPase activity. Previous data have shown that these LRRK2 PD-mutations are located in the interface between Roc and COR. Importantly, analogous mutations in the conserved   C. tepidum   Roc/COR interface significantly influence the structure and nt-induced conformational changes of the Roc domains. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nThe Roco family comprises large multi-domain proteins that are characterized by the presence of a Ras (rat sarcoma)-like GTP-binding (G) domain called Ras of complex proteins (Roc) that always occurs in tandem with a C-terminal of Roc (COR) domain [ \u2013 ]. Roco family proteins can be found in bacteria, plants and animals. Four Roco proteins are identified in vertebrates, called leucine-rich repeat (LRR) kinase 1 (LRRK1), LRRK2, death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) and malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequences with leucine-rich tandem repeats (MASL). Human MASL has the simplest architecture that is also found in other metazoans, plants and prokaryotes. In these proteins, the RocCOR tandem is always preceded by an LRR domain ( a). The human proteins LRRK2 and LRRK1 have, in addition to the RocCOR tandem, an N-terminal LRR and C-terminal kinase domain. DAPK1, which is only found in metazoans, is characterized by the presence of a tumour-suppressor DAPKs domain. Despite the variation in architecture of the Roco proteins, previous studies suggest that the function and structure of the catalytic core is conserved [ ]. \n   The Roco protein family  \n(  a  ) Domain topology of the Roco family proteins. The domains are ankyrin repeats (ANK), armadillo repeats (ARM), cyclic nt-binding domain (cNB), COR, death domain (DD), dishevelled, egl\u201310 and pleckstrin (DEP), Rab-like GTPase activators and myotubularins (GRAM), LRR, kinase (KIN), N-terminal motif of RasGEF (N-GEF), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), RasGEF and Roc. (  b  ) Model of the RocCOR dimer in two different orientations separated by 90\u00b0, with residues replaced by cysteine (except for Cys ) and subsequently labelled with MTSSL marked by spheres at the positions of their C\u03b1 atoms. The different protomers are shown in blue (light blue: COR-A, dark blue: Roc-A) and green (light green COR-B, dark green: Roc-B) respectively. The model has been created from the crystal structure of the   C. tepidum   RocCOR construct (pdb: 3DPU). The missing Roc-B domain in the X-ray structure was modelled into a position analogous to Roc-A. Loop regions not resolved in the structural model were also modelled (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 for details). (  c  ) Sequence alignment and secondary structure assignment of the RocCOR tandem for   C. tepidum   Roco and human LRRK2. Conserved residues are shown in red (identical amino acids) and orange (similar amino acids). Positions where the Parkinson mutations addressed in the present study appear in LRRK2 are marked by grey boxes. Spin-label positions are indicated by yellow boxes. \n  \nThe most prominent member is LRRK2 that has been found to be mutated and activated in individuals suffering from familial Parkinson's disease (PD, OMIM no. 168600). Previously we have shown that Roco proteins belong to the class of G-proteins activated by nt-dependent dimerization (GADs) [ , ]. This class includes the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR) [ ], membrane fission and fusion proteins like dynamin [ ] and atlastin [ ], anti-viral dynamin-like proteins like human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hGBP1) [ ], the Toc (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) family of plant protein transporters [ ], tRNA-modifying enzymes like MnmE (Methyl-amino(N)-Methyl modifying protein E) [ ] and its human orthologue GTPBP3 [ ] and cytoskeletal proteins of the septin family [ ]. Despite the increasing interest in this class of proteins on grounds of the medical relevance of its members, they are, by far, not as well characterized as their \u2018conventional\u2019 counterparts like the members of the Ras superfamily. Conventional guanine nt-binding proteins (G proteins) like Ras cycle between a GDP- (\u2018off\u2019) and a GTP-bound (\u2018on\u2019) state with the help of regulatory proteins. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) complement and/or stabilize the active site to increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis by several orders of magnitude [ , ]. Nt exchange, i.e. release of GDP or GTP, on the other hand, is accelerated by interaction with guanine nt-exchange factors (GEFs), which strongly reduce nt affinity. \n\nIn contrast, GADs show reciprocal complementation of their active sites and seem not to require GAPs and GEFs, as they appear to contain the elements necessary for the nt-regulated switching cycle [ ]. They exhibit low nt affinity, rendering the need for GEFs to exchange GDP for GTP unnecessary and dimerize upon GTP binding to supplement each other with elements needed for efficient GTP hydrolysis, rendering GAPs as accessory proteins obsolete. Although the basic principles mentioned above seem to apply to all GADs, significant mechanistic differences have been observed [ ]. \n\nIt has been a challenge to study the LRRK2 G-protein cycle [ ]. A few GAPs and GEFs have been reported for LRRK2; however, none of these putative regulators directly bind to the Roc domain [ \u2013 ]. Furthermore, LRRK2 has a low nt affinity (micromolar range) and a hydrolysis rate similar to that of other Roco proteins and small GTPases [ , ]. Data of various studies suggest that LRRK2 forms, like bacterial Roco proteins, an active dimer via the COR domains [ , , , ]. Due to the lack of adequate amount of recombinant LRRK2 proteins, structural understanding has mainly come from work with related Roco proteins [ ]. Crystal structures of the   Chlorobium tepidum   RocCOR (  Ct  RocCOR) unit [ ] ( b) and   Methanosarcina barkeri   Roco2 RocCOR\u0394C unit [ ] reveal a typical small G-protein fold for the Roc domain. The COR domains in the   Ct  RocCOR structure are a dimer in which the N-termini interact with the, between man and bacteria highly conserved ( c), Roc domain of the same protomer and the less conserved C-termini function as a dimerization device [ , , ]. Consistent with other GADs, dimerization is essential for GTPase activity; the Roco proteins in   C. tepidum   (Arg ;  c) and   M. barkeri   use an arginine finger of one monomer to complete the catalytic machinery of the other monomer (Arg  in   C. tepidum  ;  c). Together, these data thus suggest that Roco proteins, including LRRK2, belong to the GAD family of G-proteins. However, the   C. tepidum   and   M. barkeri   structures were only solved in the nt-free and GDP-bound states respectively [ , ]. Therefore, the exact mechanism of the Roc G-protein cycle is still not well understood. \n\nUsing a stable recombinant LRRK2 RocCOR\u2013kinase fragment, we obtained more detailed kinetic data for the G-protein cycle which suggests that, in analogy to bacterial Roco proteins, dimerization is essential for efficient GTP hydrolysis. To gain insights into the solution structure and conformational dynamics of the RocCOR dimer, we investigated the   C. tepidum   RocCOR unit using site-directed spin labelling [ , ] and EPR spectroscopy. This technique has already been successfully applied to characterize relative motions and/or association/dissociation of the G domains in course of the GTPase cycle for several other proteins of the GAD family, like MnmE [ , ], Toc34 [ ] and hGBP1 [ ]. We focused on three major questions: (i) does the COR domain provide a stable scaffold for the Roc domains, (ii) what are the conformational dynamics of the Roc dimer in course of the GTPase cycle and (iii) how do mutations in the conserved Roc/COR interface influence these conformational dynamics? \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Protein expression, purification and GTP hydrolysis \n  \nThe indicated cysteine mutants were generated by the method of Quick change. The   C. tepidum   RocCOR [amino acid (AA) 412\u2013946] mutants were expressed and purified as previously described for the corresponding wild-type protein [ ]. The LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase (AA 1334\u20132147) fragments were expressed in   Sf  9 cells from a pfastBac vector containing an N-terminal histidine-tag (Invitrogen) and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) matrix. A multiple turnover radioactive charcoal assay was used to measure the GTPase activity of the isolated LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase mutants. For this, 100\u00a0nM of the mutants was incubated in buffer (50\u00a0mM NaCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris/HCl, 10\u00a0mM MgCl , pH\u00a07.5, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5\u00a0mg/ml BSA) with up to 1\u00a0mM GTP including GTP-\u03b3- P at 25\u00b0C. Samples were taken at the indicated time points and immediately quenched with ice-cold 20\u00a0mM phosphoric acid containing 5% activated charcoal. The charcoal-bound non-hydrolysed GTP was precipitated by centrifugation and the supernatant containing organic phosphate was subsequently subjected to scintillation counting. The data were fitted by GraFit (Erithacus software). \n\n\n### Spin labelling \n  \nThe spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL; Enzo life sciences) was covalently attached to the cysteine residues of the RocCOR mutants. In brief, the protein in buffer (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 30\u00a0mM Tris/HCl, 5\u00a0mM MgCl , pH\u00a07.5) was incubated with 10\u00a0mM DTT for \u223c12\u00a0h. DTT was removed by repeated buffer exchange using the same buffer. Afterwards, the protein was incubated for \u223c12\u00a0h with 1\u00a0mM MTSSL and excess label was also removed by repeated buffer exchange. For EPR [double electron\u2013electron resonance (DEER)] experiments at low temperature (50 K) the buffer was supplemented with 5% glycerol (v/v). We omitted the use of deuterated solvents (that are commonly used to slow down spin relaxation and to increase the accessible distance range and/or increase the signal-to-noise ratio) to safely exclude possible isotope effects on nt-binding and conformational changes and/or shifts of the conformational equilibrium induced by nt-binding. For the different nt-bound states either 1\u00a0mM GDP, 1mM 5\u2032-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) or 1\u00a0mM GDP, 1\u00a0mM AlCl  and 10\u00a0mM NaF was added respectively. Spin concentrations have been determined by double integration of room temperature continuous wave (cw) spectra and comparison with reference samples of known spin concentration and have been used to calculate spin-labelling efficiencies that have been found to vary significantly between the different RocCOR mutants (40%\u2013100%). For all EPR experiments, the protein concentrations were 50\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM. \n\n\n### EPR spectroscopy \n  \nCW EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (298 K) with a home-made EPR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker dielectric resonator (MD5), with the microwave power set to 0.4\u20130.6 mW and B-field modulation amplitude adjusted to 0.15 mT. Samples were loaded into EPR glass capillaries (0.9\u00a0mm inner diameter, sample volume 20\u00a0\u03bcl). \n\nDEER measurements were accomplished at X-band frequencies (9.3\u20139.4 GHz) with a Bruker Elexsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Flexline split-ring resonator ER 4118XMS3 and a continuous flow helium cryostat ESR900 (Oxford Instruments) controlled by an Oxford Intelligent temperature controller ITC 503S. Measurements were performed using the four-pulse DEER sequence [ , ]: \n\n\n\nA two-step phase cycling [+(x),\u2013(x)] was performed on \u03c0/2(  \u03bd  ). Time   t  \u2032 is varied, whereas   \u03c4   and   \u03c4   are kept constant. The dipolar evolution time is given by   t  =  t  \u2032\u2013  \u03c4  . Data were analysed only for   t   > 0. The resonator was over-coupled to   Q   \u2248 100; the pump frequency   \u03bd   was set to the centre of the resonator dip and coincided with the maximum of the nitroxide EPR spectrum, whereas the observer frequency   \u03bd   was \u223c65\u201375\u00a0MHz higher, coinciding with the low-field local maximum of the spectrum. All measurements were performed at a temperature of 50 K with observer pulse lengths of 16\u00a0ns for \u03c0/2 and 32\u00a0ns for \u03c0 pulses and a pump pulse length of 12\u00a0ns. Proton modulation was averaged by adding traces at eight different   \u03c4   values, starting at   \u03c4  =200\u00a0ns and incrementing by \u2206  \u03c4  =8\u00a0ns. Data points were collected in 8-ns time steps. The total measurement time for each sample was 24\u201348\u00a0h. Data analysis was performed with the software package DeerAnalysis2013 [ ] in the distance range 1.0\u20138.0\u00a0nm with regularization parameters according to the L-curve criterion. The mean distances given in   are calculated from the distance range 1.5\u20136.0\u00a0nm that is also shown in   and  . \n   Interprotomer distances in   Ct  RocCOR  \n(  a  ) Site-directed spin labelling. After site-directed mutagenesis to replace the residue of interest by cysteine, reaction of the MTSSL with the thiol group of the cysteine yields the spin-label side chain commonly abbreviated as R1.

The difference amplitudes have been scaled for better visualization. \n     Theoretical and experimental inter-spin distances      \n\n### Modelling of Roc-B and missing loop regions into the RocCOR dimer \n  \nModelling of the full RocCOR dimer structure was performed using the software package YASARA Structure [ ] with the following procedure: (i) The COR domain of a copy of RocCOR-A was overlayed on to Roc-B to create Roc-B in a position analogous to Roc-A. (ii) Internal missing loops in Roc-A were added using the \u2018BuildLoop\u2019 and \u2018OptimizeLoop\u2019 commands in YASARA, including 3\u20134 residues on both the N- and the C-terminal side of the gaps in the sequence. (iii) The initial Roc-B domain (without internal loops) was deleted and step (i) was repeated with RocCOR-A comprising the internal loops. (iv) For both RocCOR units, the connecting loops between Roc and COR were modelled as described in (ii). The YASARA scripts used for loop modelling are included in the supplementary materials. \n\n\n### MD simulation and rotamer library analysis \n  \nThe completed RocCOR dimer model (see above) was immersed in a water box [(128.9 \u00c5) ; 1 \u00c5=0.1 nm] filled with TIP3P water and \u223c150\u00a0mM sodium and chloride ions, neutralizing the system's net charge. Periodic boundary conditions have been applied. Initial atomic clashes in the starting structure were removed by energy minimization (steepest descent). A 16\u00a0ns MD simulation was carried out in YASARA, utilizing the Amber03 force field [ ] and using Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) summation for long-range electrostatic interactions with a cut-off at 7.86 \u00c5. The time step for the calculation of intramolecular forces was 1.25 fs (simulation sub-step), intermolecular forces have been calculated every two simulation sub-steps (2.5 fs). The simulation temperature was 298 K. Temperature control was carried out by rescaling atom velocities. Pressure control was achieved by keeping the solvent (H O) density at 0.997\u00a0g/ml and rescaling the simulation cell along all the three axes. Simulation snapshots have been taken each 83.3ps and analysed in YASARA. Total energies and mean backbone RMSD values compared with simulation time are shown in Supplementary Figure S2(a). RMSD and root-mean square fluctuations (RMSF) values per residue are shown in Supplementary Figure S2(b). \n\nInter-spin label distance distributions were simulated using a rotamer library of spin-labelled residues as described in [ ]. The rotamer library implemented in the software package MMM2011 [ ] consisted of 210 rotamers of MTSSL bound to cysteine, which have been used to replace the native residues at the positions of interest in the MD snapshots. Energies and resulting populations for individual rotamers were calculated by means of a Lennard\u2013Jones potential at 175 K (the glass transition temperature for a water\u2013glycerol mixture) and have been used as weights in the simulation of the distance distributions. For more details about the rotamer library analysis (RLA) see [ ]. In total 33 structures from the trajectory have been subjected to RLA (at 0, 0.5, 1.0, \u2026, 16.0\u00a0ns), summed up and normalized to obtain the final RLA distance distribution (MD-RLA). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### DEER inter-spin distance determination \n  \nTo follow structural changes in   Ct  RocCOR (RocCOR from now) that occur upon binding of different nts, we applied site-directed spin labelling. Positions mutated to cysteine for spin labelling with MTSSL, see  a) are Thr  (close to the P-loop) and Ser  (close to the switch II region) in the Roc domains. The native cysteine at position 600\u00a0in Roc was also used for labelling. Single-site labelling of RocCOR results in the introduction of two symmetry-related spin labels in the RocCOR dimer. Using a model of the   Ct  RocCOR dimer ( b), where Roc-B, missing in the X-ray structure [ ] and unresolved loop regions have been modelled (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019), the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b2 distances for these positions could be determined as 2.3\u00a0nm (Thr ), 2.1\u00a0nm (Ser ) and 3.5\u00a0nm (Cys ;  ). To verify the assumption that the COR dimer serves as a rigid scaffold for the two Roc domains and is not significantly influenced by Roc domain motions, a spin-label side chain was introduced replacing Ser  at the \u2018top\u2019 of the COR domains (C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b2: 2.5\u00a0nm). No significant impairment of GTPase activity by the mutations in comparison with wild-type could be observed (Supplementary Table S1). \n\nWe applied a pulsed EPR method, DEER or pulsed electron double resonance (PELDOR) [ , ], to measure distances between spin-label side chains ranging from 1.5 to 6\u00a0nm in frozen (50 K) samples.   shows the results of the DEER measurements with RocCOR in four different states of the GTPase cycle; in the apo state without any nt (grey, black), in the active state with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GppNHp (green), in the GTP hydrolysis transition state (red) mimicked by GDP\u00b7AlF  (GDP-aluminum fluoride) [ ] and in the GDP-bound inactive state (blue).  (b) shows the background-corrected dipolar evolution data with fits obtained by Tikhonov regularization (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019) and  (c) the corresponding distance distributions. Mean distances calculated from the distance distributions are summarized in  \n\n\n### The COR domain is a stable dimerization device \n  \nA spin-label side chain at position 928 at the \u2018top\u2019 of the COR dimer ( b) reports on the validity of the structural model and on possible conformational and dynamic changes upon binding of the different nts. In agreement with the presumed role of the COR domain dimer to function as a scaffold for the Roc G-domains, only minor changes are observed in the distance distributions represented by two broad peaks centred approximately 2.2\u00a0nm (\u223c70%\u201380% area) and 3.9\u00a0nm (\u223c20%\u201330%), indicating that no significant conformational changes upon binding of the different nts take place in the COR dimer ( ). The observed changes mainly concern the width of the short distance peak and the relative contribution of the second peak. The latter contributions in the distance distributions at \u223c3.9\u00a0nm are at the upper boundary of the accessible distance range given by the dipolar evolution times. Nevertheless, validation of the DEER data analyses (Supplementary Figure S1) indicates that these peaks are significant, but also that their relative contributions partly depend on the background correction. Due to this ambiguity, we do not further discuss the observed changes of <10% in the relative contribution of this peak to the overall distance distributions. \n\nWe calculated inter-spin distance distributions that can be compared with the experimental results from the completed structural model (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019) for the RocCOR dimer applying a RLA approach [ ] to account for the dynamics of the spin-label side chain (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019). To consider also small-scale protein backbone dynamics, we carried out a MD simulation (16\u00a0ns, Amber03 forcefield, PIP3P water, 298 K; Supplementary Figure S2) with the structural model and performed the RLA on snapshots equally distributed over the MD trajectory (MD-RLA; for details see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019). The results of these analyses for the spin-labelled positions in RocCOR are shown as dotted lines (black) in the distance distributions in  (c). The MD-RLA distance distribution for S928R1 exhibits a broad peak centred approximately 2.8\u00a0nm, covering distances ranging from 2 to 4\u00a0nm. This is in line with the solvent-exposed location of S928R1 on the protein surface and inspection of the MD trajectory and the RLA distance distributions obtained for the single MD snapshots (Supplementary Figure S3) reveals that small-scale backbone dynamics not significantly contribute to the width of the calculated distance distribution [RMSF < 0.2\u00a0nm for residue 928 and for the C-terminal half of the COR domain (residues 781-end); Supplementary Figure S2b]. Comparison with the experimental distance distribution ( b) shows clear deviations although approximately the same distance range is covered. The experimental distance distribution is bimodal and the major distance between the two spin-label side chains in the RocCOR dimer appears to be approximately 0.6\u00a0nm shorter than predicted from the MD-RLA. The latter observation most probably indicates a more tight arrangement of the COR dimer in solution, which could then also explain the presence of the long-distance peak: a conformation in solution different from the structural model might, due to increased steric hindrance of the spin label in a more closely packed COR dimer, cause two distinct rotamer populations with different orientations. Such differences between the X-ray model and the structure of the protein dimer in solution could possibly be explained by the observed crystal contacts that COR-A is involved in [ ]. Alternative explanations for the bimodal character of the experimental distance distributions could be aggregation or multimerization of the protein under our experimental conditions or that a second stable conformation of the ROC C-terminal domain exists, which is responsible for the second peak in the experimental distance distribution. Although we cannot safely distinguish between these possibilities, in all cases the COR domains serve as a stable dimerization device as neither the conformation nor a possible two-state equilibrium is significantly influenced upon binding of the different nts. \n\n\n### The Roc domains display conformational heterogeneity that prevails in the presence of different nts \n  \nThe experimental distance distributions for all three spin-label mutations in the Roc domain ( ) in the apo state are very broad and characterized by multiple peaks. Although the MD-RLA especially for positions 476 and 600 already predicts broad and multimodal distance distributions owing to their solvent-exposed location on the protein surface ( d), the exceptional experimental distribution widths, corresponding to the absence of clear dipolar modulations in the DEER form factors shown in  (b), indicate in addition conformational heterogeneity of the Roc domains. In particular, for T476R1 significant contributions at longer distances, for C600R1 at shorter distances and both for S542R1 are observed that do not coincide with the predictions from the structural model ( b), suggesting that the Roc domains in the model represent only one snapshot of the conformational ensemble that characterizes the G domains of the RocCOR tandem in solution. This observation is in line with the absence of electron density for the Roc-B domain in the crystal structure of the RocCOR tandem and further supports the notion that the Roc domains are generally highly mobile and that Roc-A is only visible due to stabilizing crystal contacts [ ]. To identify additional conformational states, difference distance distributions [\u0394  P(d)  ] ( e) were calculated by subtracting the   P(d)   of the MD-RLA from the respective   P(d)   of the experimental data for the apo state. Grey-shaded areas indicate the remaining contributions of the distance distributions. It has to be noted that deconvolution of the experimental distance distributions is complicated due to the combined effects of spin-label rotamer distribution, protein conformational heterogeneity and experimental uncertainties. Furthermore, as discussed above for the DEER data for position 928, we cannot exclude a possible influence of background-correction artefacts. Nevertheless, the broadness and multimodality of the remaining contributions attributable to conformational states different from the crystal structure indicate the presence of at least two additional conformations. This is most obvious for position 542 where the difference distance distribution exhibits two clearly distinct populations. This leads us to the conclusion that the Roc domains in the RocCOR dimer in solution are characterized by at least three conformational states in equilibrium. \n\nThe distance distributions observed in the presence of GppNHp, GDP\u00b7AlF  or GDP ( c) reveal changes upon nt binding, but the conformational heterogeneity observed in the apo state largely prevails under all conditions tested, again indicating the presence of multiple conformational states. To identify possible shifts in the occupancy of these states, difference distance distributions [\u0394  P(d)  ] ( e) were calculated by subtracting   P(d)   for the apo state from   P(d)   obtained in the presence of the respective nts. As an additional indication for the average direction of the inter-spin distance changes upon nt binding, we calculated the means of the experimental distance distributions ( ). \n\nFor S542R1, located directly in the dimer interface of the two Roc domains ( d), we observed only slightly increased mean distances upon binding of GppNHp (+0.05\u00a0nm) and GDP (+0.12\u00a0nm) and a slight decrease for GDP\u00b7AlF  (\u20130.13\u00a0nm). Inspection of the distance distributions and \u0394  P(d)   plots suggest that, bearing in mind the experimental error and the limitations of Tikhonov regularization, this can be explained by de-population of the conformational state characterized by the crystal structure and increased population of the conformational states characterized by distance distributions with mean distances of \u223c\u00a02 and 4\u00a0nm respectively that have been identified in the   P(d)  \u2013  P(d)   plots. Thus, our data show a clear influence of the bound nt on the occupancy of the conformational states. Remarkably, in the GppNHp- and GDP-bound states the population of both states increases, whereas in the GTP hydrolysis state only the state with short inter spin distances shows an increased population, resulting in the shortest mean inter-spin distance observed. Furthermore, the width of the short-distance peak, being significantly decreased compared with the distribution in the apo state in the 1.5\u20133.5\u00a0nm range, indicates reduced backbone and/or label dynamics, being in line with a fully assembled active site (bearing in mind that the putative arginine finger Arg  is next to the label position) and thus a more rigid Roc dimer. Interestingly, in the GppNHp- and GDP-bound states, the width of the short-distance peak is even smaller than for GDP\u00b7AlF , but the mean distances are \u223c0.2\u00a0nm larger. This implies that nt binding, in general, causes reduced backbone and/or side chain dynamics at and near the nt-binding pocket. \n\nThe mean inter-spin distance for C600R1 ( ) also remains almost unaltered upon binding of GppNHp, but decreases in the presence of GDP\u00b7AlF  (\u20130.28\u00a0nm) and GDP (\u20130.37\u00a0nm). This is also reflected in the \u0394  P(d)   plots, which reveal increased population of conformational states characterized by shorter distances for the latter nts and population of a conformational state with inter-spin distances around the mean distance in the apo state. Nevertheless, for C600R1,as well as for T476R1, the correlation between the distance contributions in the   P(d)  \u2013  P(d)   plots with the changes in population from the   P(d) \u2013P(d)   plots is not as clear as for S542R1, possibly owing also to the increased signal-to-noise ratio for these datasets. The mean distances for T476R1 exhibit the smallest variation upon nt binding and the shortest mean inter-spin distance is observed in the apo state. This indicates that the Roc dimer does not show \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 states like they have been observed for MnmE [ ] in course of the GTPase cycle. More likely, the G domains remain largely associated and changes of their relative orientation and of specific secondary structure elements facilitate the structural requirements for the catalytic steps. Taken together, the results of the DEER inter-spin distance measurements suggest that binding of the different nts influences a complex equilibrium between multiple conformations of the Roc domains in the RocCOR dimer. \n\n\n### PD mutations in the Roc domain cause reduced GTPase activity because of an altered nt-dependent G-domain conformational equilibrium \n  \nThe most prominent PD-mutations in the LRRK2 Roc domain are Arg  to cysteine, glycine or histidine. Previously it has been suggested that the LRRK2 R1441C mutation has reduced GTPase activity [ ]. However, because of the lack of stable purified recombinant protein, it has been so far a challenge to obtain detailed quantitative data for the GTPase activity of LRRK2. We were able to express and purify small amounts of a stable LRRK2 fragment comprising the Roc-COR-kinase fragment from   Spodoptera frugiperda   Sf9 cells. A multiple turnover radioactive charcoal assay was used to measure the GTPase activity of the LRRK2 fragment. In this assay, the proteins are mixed with \u03b3 P-labelled GTP and the subsequent P  release is measured over time. The GTPase kinetics of the Roc-COR-kinase fragments of LRRK2 follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. For the wild-type protein, its   k   of phosphate release is 0.8 min  and the   K   of GTP is 343\u00a0\u03bcM. Consistent with the previous studies, the LRRK2 Roc (R1441C) PD-mutation results in a decreased GTPase activity ( ) [ , \u2013 ]. The   k   of the R1441C mutant is \u223c2-fold lower (0.37 min ) than that of the wild-type protein, whereas the   K   value is \u223c1.5-fold higher (541\u00a0\u03bcM) compared with wild-type. Unfortunately the quality and the amount of the purified LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase fragment were not sufficient for detailed biophysical studies. Furthermore, the fragment contains 15 cysteines, thus making it a very difficult target for spin labelling with standard approaches. \n   GTPase activity of human LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase fragments  \nLeft: Inorganic phosphate release of 100\u00a0nM LRRK2 protein incubated with 500\u00a0\u03bcM \u03b3 P-GTP during the indicated time. The slopes of the linear fits of phosphate release at different time-points yield the reaction rates (  v  ). Right: The reaction rates (  v  ) of wild-type and the R1441C PD-mutant of human LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase proteins are plotted against substrate (GTP) concentration. The error bars show the standard error of the reaction rate calculated from at least three measurements.   k   and   K   values are calculated by fitting the data with the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using GraFit (Erithacus Software). \n  \nThe position analogous to R  in   Ct  RocCOR is Tyr , whereas the less frequently PD-related mutation Ile  corresponds to Leu  Ct  RocCOR ( c) [ ]. Both Leu  and Tyr  are in close proximity in the hydrophobic interface between Roc and COR ( a). We previously have generated the mutants L487V, L487A and Y558A [ ]. All mutant showed a strongly reduced GTPase activity, most probably due altered interaction between the Roc and the COR domains. Since the L487A and Y558A mutations had the largest impact on GTPase activity (\u223c40-fold reduction), we analysed the impact of these mutations on the structure and dynamics of the Roc domains in the apo and different nt-bound states ( b\u2013 e). \n   Influence of mutations in the Roc/COR interface on nt-dependent interprotomer distances in CtRocCOR  \n(  a  ) Atomic model showing the hydrophobic Roc-A/COR-A interface region.

Grey distance distributions are for the respective spin-label mutants without additional mutations (  c  ) and for the MD-RLA (dotted distributions) of the dimer model shown in  (  b  ). \n  \nReplacing Leu  by alanine seems to hardly influence the Roc dimer interface in the absence of nts, as deduced from the almost unaltered distance distribution for S542R1, except reduced relative amplitude of the long distance peak. In contrast, significant alterations are observed for T476R1 and C600R1, mainly characterized by increased distance distribution widths and a shift towards shorter distances, as can also be seen from comparison of the mean inter-spin distances reported in  . This suggests that the Roc dimer remains stable but appears to be detached from the COR scaffold, what might also be reflected in the increased flexibility observed for position C600R1. Upon binding of the different nts in most cases also a shift towards shorter distances is observed ( ) and the distance distributions are broader, further supporting the notion that the PD-mutation significantly weakens the Roc\u2013COR interaction. This effect is even more pronounced in the Y558A mutant, where in contrast with L487A also the Roc dimer interface appears to be more strongly affected, as deduced from the broad and flat distance distribution ranging from <1.5 to 4.5\u00a0nm for S542R1\u00a0in the apo state. This significantly increased flexibility of the Roc dimer interface largely prevails in the nt-bound states, indicating that the ability of the Roc domains to adopt a functional dimer conformation, i.e. to populate the catalytically-active conformational state, is strongly impaired, thus explaining the reduced GTP hydrolysis rate. Similar effects on the distance distributions are observed for C600R1, whereas the T476R1 label senses only minor changes by the Y558A substitution, mainly characterized by an increased probability to find shorter distances. Thus, removing a single hydrophobic residue from the Roc/COR interface strongly influences the complex conformational equilibrium of the Roc domains. This indicates that the COR domain dimer functions not only as a scaffold to hold the Roc domains in place, but that it also permits fine-tuning of their structure and conformational dynamics for efficient GTP hydrolysis. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe results of the DEER distance measurements show that the COR domains in the RocCOR tandem dimer serve as a scaffold for the Roc G-domains by forming a constitutive dimer through interaction of their C-terminal subdomains [ , ]. Furthermore, the   K   of GTP observed with the purified LRRK2 Roc-COR-kinase fragment (343\u03bcM) is comparable to that found for mouse full-length LRRK2 (210\u00a0\u03bcM) and for recombinant human LRRK2 Roc domain (553\u00a0\u03bcM) [ , ]. In contrast, the hydrolysis rate (  k  ) of the recombinant Roc-COR-kinase fragment is \u223c20-fold slower compared with homologous expressed mouse full-length LRRK2 (13.8 min ), but 40-fold faster than that of monomeric recombinant human LRRK2 Roc domain (0.02 min ) [ , ], suggesting that, in analogy to bacterial Roco proteins [ , ], dimerization is essential for efficient GTP hydrolysis. \n\nFurthermore, our DEER data support the notion based on the absence of defined electron density for the second Roc domain in the RocCOR dimer and on proteolytic digestion experiments [ ] that the Roc G-domains are highly mobile entities. They sample multiple conformations, one of which seems to be represented by the   Ct  RocCOR crystal structure. Given the large experimentally observed distance distribution widths of \u223c3\u00a0nm for all positions and under all conditions tested in the present study, the theoretical mean distances lie well within these distance intervals, as can be seen from the difference distance distributions in  (e) and the mean distance values reported in  . A swapped dimer, where the N-terminus of one Roc domain interacts with the C-terminus of its counterpart, as it has been found for isolated LRRK2\u2013Roc [ ], appears unlikely for   Ct  RocCOR, as comparison with theoretical distance distributions calculated from the LRRK2\u2013Roc dimer structure ( c, orange, dashed distributions) reveals striking disagreement especially for position 1421\u00a0in LRRK2 corresponding to Ser  in   Ct  RocCOR. We cannot exclude that the conformational equilibrium in which the Roc domains are involved might involve states that resemble the swapped dimer structure, as the expected inter-spin distance of \u223c6.7\u00a0nm is beyond the detection limit of the DEER experiment. Nevertheless, available crystal structures of RocCOR tandems reveal that formation of a swapped Roc dimer would lead to serious clashes with the N-terminal part of the respective COR domain [ , ]. We further cannot exclude that the human Roc protein and the bacterial Roco protein exhibit significant structural differences. However, taking into account the high conservation between   Ct  RocCOR and LRRK2 of especially the region around Switch II, where Ser  is located, our results strongly support for the notion that the swapped-dimer structure has no functional relevance [ , ]. Our data also show that binding of different nts leads to complex alterations of the occupancies of the conformational states. The distance measurements further show that no large-scale G domain motions take place during the GTPase cycle, like they have been observed by EPR and/or FRET distance measurements for other members of the GAD family. We previously showed that in the constitutive dimer of the tRNA-modifying enzyme MnmE the G domains in the apo and GDP-bound state adopt an \u2018open\u2019 conformation where they are separated by \u223c2\u20133\u00a0nm and that binding of GTP and subsequent hydrolysis leads to a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation where also the G-domains dimerize [ , ]. We observed a similar mechanism for hGBP1, which is a monomer in the apo and GDP-bound states, but binding of GTP induces dimerization of the G domains, leading to conformational changes in neighbouring domains that further tighten the dimer interaction [ ]. A slightly different mechanism was recently observed for the Toc34 GTPase homodimer involved in chloroplast pre-protein translocation [ ]. In this case, the GTP bound state was found to exhibit an \u2018open\u2019 and very dynamic conformation, whereas the G-domains in the GDP- and GDP\u00b7AlF -bound states form a quite rigid (\u2018closed\u2019) dimer. In contrast with that, we could not identify \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 conformations for the G-domains in the RocCOR dimer. Our observations indicate that the Roc domains remain associated throughout the whole GTP hydrolysis cycle, as can be seen from comparison with the mean inter-spin distances reported in  . Nevertheless, in the GTP hydrolysis transition state mimicked with GDP\u00b7AlF  the mean inter-spin distances and distribution widths especially for S542R1 appear to be decreased, suggesting a more rigid assembly of the G domains compared with the other states. Thus, mutual complementation of the G-domain's catalytic centres by protrusion of the in prokaryotes conserved arginine finger (Arg ) into the active site of the other protomer to promote GTP hydrolysis would take place in RocCOR via subtle domain movements, e.g. relative rotation of the two domains and local conformational changes in the Roc domains rather than by large scale conformational changes and domain association. Furthermore, these observations indicate that, in contrast with other GADs like MnmE and hGBP1 where the isolated G domains suffice to form a functional dimer, the COR dimer scaffold is not only necessary to keep the Roc G-domains in close vicinity, but also for fine-tuning of their conformational equilibrium to favour states that are competent for nt-exchange and GTP hydrolysis respectively. Consequently, our findings also provide a rationale for regulation of the GTPase activity by neighbouring domains in Roco proteins. \n\nWe confirmed that the LRRK2\u2013R1441C PD-related mutation results in decreased GTPase activity. The   C. tepidum   RocCOR structure revealed that the position analogous to this LRRK2 PD-mutation site is located in the hydrophobic Roc/COR interface that is highly conserved between bacteria and man [ ]. We showed that mutations in the   Ct  Roc domain that are located in the Roc/COR interface and that have been shown to have the strongest effects on GTPase activity [ ] significantly alter the conformational equilibrium of the G-domains, mainly reflected in increased flexibility and a bias towards (additional) conformations characterized by shorter inter spin distances, especially in the nt-bound states. Consistently, previous data suggest that PD-mutations in the LRRK2 Roc domain de-stabilize the protein, whereas LRRK2 PD-mutations in the COR domain alter the interaction between the Roc and COR domain [ , ]. This further supports the notion that the interaction between the N-terminal half of the COR domain and Roc controls the conformational equilibrium of the G domains and that perturbations by mutations in this interface largely alter their energy landscape, disfavouring population of the catalytically-active conformational states. \n\nAlthough we cannot exclude that the LRRK2 RocCOR domain has a different structure and activation mechanism than bacterial Roco proteins, it seems rather unlikely. Recent data have shown that LRRK2 has a similar low nt affinity and hydrolysis activity to that of the bacterial Roco proteins [ , ]. Like bacterial Roco proteins, LRRK2 forms an active dimer via the COR domains and our data suggest that GTPase activity depends on dimerization [ , , , ]. The PD mutations in the LRRK2 RocCOR domain, as well as the PD-analogous mutations in   Ct  RocCOR, do not affect nt binding, but do results in impaired GTPase activity [ , , ]. We therefore would like to postulate that PD-related mutations in the conserved Roc/COR interface of both LRRK2 and   C. tepidum   have a strong effect on the dynamics of the Roc domains and that this is the primary cause of the decreased GTPase activity of both proteins [ , \u2013 ]. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4721548, "text_md5": "5e1bf64b4843aa30bcf7175c3754401c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 142], "journal": [143, 153], "publication_year": [155, 159], "title": [170, 292], "keywords": [306, 561], "abstract": [574, 2586], "body": [2595, 45801]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 26310572, "doi": "10.1042/BSR20150128", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721548", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4721548"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721548\">4721548</a>", "list_title": "PMC4721548  Conformational heterogeneity of the Roc domains in C. tepidum Roc\u2013COR and implications for human LRRK2 Parkinson mutations"}

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has been used extensively to understand such pathological WM changes, and the focus of this systematic review is to understand both the methods utilized and their corresponding results in the context of early-stage PD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is the most commonly utilized method to probe WM pathological changes. Previous studies have suggested that DTI metrics are sensitive in capturing early disease-associated WM changes in preclinical symptomatic regions such as olfactory regions and the substantia nigra, which is considered to be a hallmark of PD pathology and progression. Postprocessing analytic approaches include region of interest\u2013based analysis, voxel-based analysis, skeletonized approaches, and connectome analysis, each with unique advantages and challenges. While DTI has been used extensively to study WM disorganization in early-stage PD, it has several limitations, including an inability to resolve multiple fiber orientations within each voxel and sensitivity to partial volume effects. Given the subtle changes associated with early-stage PD, these limitations result in inaccuracies that severely impact the reliability of DTI-based metrics as potential biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, advanced dMRI acquisition and analysis methods have been employed, including diffusion kurtosis imaging and q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction. The combination of improved acquisition and analysis in DTI may yield novel and accurate information related to WM-associated changes in early-stage PD. In the current article, we present a systematic and critical review of dMRI studies in early-stage PD, with a focus on recent advances in DTI methodology. Yielding novel metrics, these advanced methods have been shown to detect diffuse WM changes in early-stage PD. These findings support the notion of early axonal damage in PD and suggest that WM pathology may go unrecognized until symptoms appear. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of different dMRI techniques, analysis methods, and software employed are discussed in the context of PD-related pathology. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 10 million people worldwide ( \u2013 ). Parkinson disease pathology is characterized by Lewy body aggregates and neurites ( ,  ), which play a causative role in degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN); motor symptoms associated with PD have been primarily attributed to this process ( ). By the time PD becomes symptomatic, an estimated 60% of dopaminergic neurons have degenerated, representing a moderate to severe state of disease ( ). Biomarkers, including fluid and imaging based, may play a critical role in understanding the natural history of progression of PD and enable appropriate therapeutic intervention, thereby optimizing preservation of neural health ( ). However, to date, no definitive biomarker exists for this purpose, despite the clear need for one. \n\nImaging-based biomarkers for PD can yield insight into atrophy, microstructural changes, neuronal activity, and vascular hemodynamics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, both structural and functional, are increasingly used in PD for more comprehensive evaluation of neuropathology. Subtle brain atrophy has been demonstrated in PD using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), which is an automated analysis approach to characterize volumetric brain changes from three-dimensional structural imaging ( \u2013 ). Altered patterns of neuronal activation, measured via functional MRI (fMRI), have been observed in multiple regions of the cortex in PD using a range of motoric tasks ( \u2013 ). Resting-state fMRI is measured in the absence of tasks and can identify abnormalities in spontaneous neuronal activity ( ). In particular, this approach has revealed changes in the corticosubcortical functional connectivity in PD compared with healthy controls (HCs) ( ). \n\nDiffusion MRI (dMRI) comprises a set of complementary techniques to non-invasively probe microstructural characteristics via diffusivity of water molecules in the brain. As water predominantly diffuses along axons, dMRI can be used to probe white matter (WM) changes such as axonal caliber, density, myelination, and orientation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the most common dMRI model, can provide measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) ( ) that are sensitive to subtle WM microstructural organization. Since the inception of DTI in the mid-1990s ( ), significant improvements have been made in both acquisition and analysis methods. These advances include the implementation of multishell and high-angular-resolution dMRI data, such as those with more diffusion-encoding gradient directions, resulting in the development of advanced algorithms to improve dMRI postprocessing and overcome some of the known limitations of DTI. The availability of standard software has further enabled quantitative analysis of DTI and DTI-related metrics including advanced dMRI models. At present, DTI represents one of the most widely used neuroimaging methods, in both preclinical animal and human studies, for its versatility and specificity to WM microstructure ( ). We encourage interested readers to refer to References ( ,  \u2013 ) for a more in-depth understanding of DTI. \n\nWhite matter changes in PD vs. controls (healthy subjects; HCs) have previously been evaluated by DTI using various metrics, acquisitions, analyses, and software tools ( ). More specifically, a recent meta-analysis encompassing wide disease duration DTI studies in PD found that both FA and MD were able to distinguish between PD and HC, with regional DTI changes observed in the SN, corpus callosum, cingulate, and temporal cortices. Considering the growing interest in defining the early phases of PD through the use of neuroimaging biomarkers, the focus of this systematic review is the current state of dMRI-based biomarkers for understanding early-stage PD, with an emphasis on the technical methodologies employed for dMRI. More specifically, the basic theoretical background for standard DTI will be provided, along with three more advanced methods that go beyond standard DTI methods [diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and Q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR)]. The relevant results in early-stage PD will be discussed for each of these methods. Additionally, the advantages and disadvantages of different dMRI acquisition techniques, analysis methods, and software employed will be discussed in the context of early-stage PD-related pathology. The commonalities and incongruences in findings in early-stage PD will be contextualized between the various dMRI methods. Finally, given the current state of understanding of early-stage PD and known capabilities of dMRI approaches, the outlook for future opportunities in dMRI to improve pathophysiological characterization of early-stage PD will be discussed. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( ), we searched three databases ( ) for works that included at least one group of early PD [defined as subjects with Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage \u22642 and/or disease duration <5 years] and where one or more dMRI methods were used (see PRISMA diagram in  ). To identify the articles for this systematic review, we searched for publications on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases by using the keywords \u201cearly Parkinson,\u201d \u201cMRI diffusion,\u201d and \u201cDTI\u201d without any temporal restriction. In total, we found 349 records. After excluding duplicates (  n   = 254), screening and eligibility further reduced the number to 62 articles retained for this review. \n  \nSearch strategy based on PRISMA flow diagram. \n  \nWhile most studies used site-specific data, several studies leveraged the open-access availability of data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) ( ).

The diffusion-weighted signal intensity for this distribution can be described by the following equation: \n\nwhere   S   is the signal intensity without the diffusion gradient,   D   is the diffusion coefficient, and   b   is the diffusion-weighting factor, where the   b   factor is largely dependent on the gradient waveform. The diffusion can thus be represented by the following equation: \n\nwhere   is a three-element column vector representing a gradient direction,   is the transpose of  , and   is the apparent diffusion tensor (3 \u00d7 3 symmetric matrix). \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging provides a direct relationship between the chosen experimental parameters, such as   b   and  , the MR measurements (  S   and   S  ), and the parameters of the diffusion tensor model  . \n\nEigendecomposition of the diffusion matrix yields a symmetric diffusion tensor: \n\nwhere \u03bb , \u03bb , and \u03bb  are the eigenvalues (with \u03bb  \u2265 \u03bb  \u2265 \u03bb ) and \u03f5 , \u03f5 , and \u03f5  are the eigenvectors of  . The diffusion tensor is completely characterized by these eigenvalues, which describe the length of the three axes of the diffusion ellipsoid, and their corresponding eigenvectors, which describe the orientation of these axes in space. As the eigenvectors provide information about the direction of water diffusion within a voxel, they form the basis of brain fiber tracking ( ,  ). The geometric shape associated with the diffusion tensor is assumed to be a three-dimensional ellipsoid with the length of the three orthogonal principal axes proportional to the ordered tensor eigenvalues. \n\nThe first eigenvalue (\u03bb ) represents water diffusivity along the principal axis and is termed axial (or longitudinal or parallel) diffusivity (\u03bb  or AxD). The radial (or transverse or perpendicular) diffusivity (\u03bb  or RD) represents water diffusion perpendicular to the principal direction and is given by the average of the remaining eigenvalues ((\u03bb  + \u03bb )/2). Axial diffusivity has been associated with axonal damage, whereas RD may be associated with myelin integrity, axonal diameter and density, and fiber coherence ( ,  ). Mean diffusivity is a rotationally invariant metric, obtained from a simple average of the diffusion eigenvectors ((\u03bb  + \u03bb  + \u03bb )/3), which describes the overall size of the tensor. \n\nFractional anisotropy quantifies the degree of anisotropy of the diffusion tensor and is the most common DTI-related index. Fractional anisotropy ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents isotropic diffusion and 1 represents completely anisotropic diffusion. Fractional anisotropy can be calculated in each voxel using the following equation: \n\nWhile this index has often been interpreted as a quantitative biomarker of WM disorganization, equating FA with WM disorganization is not strictly accurate, given that FA cannot disentangle the individual microscopic contributions, such as different WM fiber populations and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contamination ( ,  ). Fractional anisotropy has also been equated as a marker of demyelination ( ), which is also not accurate because the regional anisotropy may also reflect altered axonal diameter, packing density, or membrane permeability ( ). Despite these limitations, DTI-based FA has often been utilized as a neuroimaging biomarker because of its robustness to noise ( ,  ). Example maps for FA (gray-scale and colorized), MD, AxD, and RD are shown in   in an HC. \n  \nStandard DTI maps, from a healthy volunteer, created by DSI Studio with a DTI diffusion scheme with a total of 67 diffusion sampling directions.

The range of FA in between 0 (isotropic diffusion) and 1 (anisotropic diffusion). \n  \nTractography goes beyond the conventional quantitative voxel-wise metrics to generate a three-dimensional representation of WM fiber bundles.   shows an example tractography (B), with FA shown in (A), in an HC. Tractography consists of a multistep procedure to reconstruct WM fiber bundles inside the brain, namely, seeding, propagation, and termination. Many options, and best practices, for each of these steps can be found in the literature ( ,  ), and software exists to perform these functions at varying levels. Some of the known limitations of tractography are related to acquisition (minimum number of DTI directions) and WM architecture (crossing, kissing, and diverging fibers). Other limitations include possible inaccuracies of tractography due to the presence of neuropathological changes ( ). \n  \n (A)   Fractional anisotropy maps and   (B)   an example of whole-brain deterministic tractography created by DSI Studio in a healthy volunteer (angular threshold: 60 degrees; step size: 1 mm; anisotropy threshold: 0.20. Tracks with length shorter than 50 or longer than 300 mm were discarded. A total of 500,000 seeds were placed inside the whole brain). \n  \nUpon generation of DTI-based metrics, subsequent quantitative analyses can be performed using histogram analysis, region of interest (ROI) analysis, voxel-based analysis (VBA), or skeletonized analysis [also called tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)]. Additionally, DTI enables measurement of the macroscopic orientation of WM tissue and analysis of structural connectivity through tractography algorithms. These different analysis methods are demonstrated in   and are discussed in greater detail below. \n  \nExample of the different dMRI analysis methods.   (A)   Histogram analysis;   (B)   ROI analysis;   (C)   voxel-based analysis (VBA);   (D)   skeletonized analysis (e.g., TBSS pipeline);   (E)   connectome analysis. \n  \nOne of the simplest analyses is whole-brain histogram analysis ( ). Beyond mean and median, histograms permit extraction of parameters such as histogram peak height and location that can be compared across subjects or correlated with other variables. A major advantage of whole-brain histogram analysis is that no   a priori   choice of region is required; however, one ensuing drawback is that the results may be affected by CSF contamination ( ). Region-of-interest analysis ( ) is a commonly used method to analyze DTI-derived indices, where ROIs can be obtained from automated segmentation (e.g., FreeSurfer;  ) or by manual delineation. Although ROIs can be drawn directly on the DTI-derived indices, their placement may be difficult due to low-resolution images and the intensity of DTI-derived maps (e.g., FA) may spuriously influence the ROI boundaries, thereby introducing bias into the analysis. Alternatively, ROIs may be drawn on anatomical T1- or T2-weighted images, which necessitates reliable co-registration with dMRI data. One drawback to ROI analysis is that it requires either an   a priori   hypothesis regarding where WM differences are expected to be present in a pathology or normal development as the inclusion of many ROIs increases the number of statistical tests and requires correction for multiple comparisons. \n\nMoving beyond ROI analysis, VBA is a fully automated approach that allows for the investigation of microstructural organization in each voxel inside the whole brain ( ). It involves the spatial normalization of high- and low-resolution images from the subjects' native space to stereotactic space, and thus, reliable co-registration is crucial. Additionally, smoothing of the data during analysis can increase the impact of partial volume effects (PVE), as the voxels may combine both WM and gray matter (GM) in such a way that the results are less robust and less specific to a specific component. As statistical analysis is performed in each voxel, there is also an increased risk of false-positive findings, such that multiple comparison corrections are compulsory. Finally, pathologies and lesions can strongly affect VBA results. Alternatively, TBSS (or skeletonized analysis,  ) can alleviate the alignment and smoothing challenges associated with VBA ( ). Tract-based spatial statistics is a popular pipeline used to coregister sets of DTI maps for performing voxel-wise comparisons on skeletonized WM tracts. As a result, it precludes the study of whole-brain WM tracts, focusing instead on the components of WM tracts common across all subjects (hence the name skeletonized). In recent years, several studies have questioned the reliability and interpretability of TBSS ( ), and improvements over the original TBSS pipeline have been suggested ( ). \n\nThe final analysis method covered to this review is the connectome analysis ( ), which pertains to whether there are global changes in structural connectivity patterns at the end of WM pathways ( ). Advantages of this method include that it is automated and identifies the global shift in WM connectivity pattern between the groups. Network-based measures derived through this connectome analysis can then be utilized to not only understand whether there is a global shift in WM-derived structural connectivity due to pathology but also to understand its correlations with clinical and pathological presentations. \n\n\n### DTI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nGiven the known spatiotemporal progression of changes associated with PD, ROI analysis has been used widely in early-stage PD. Moreover, given the recognized involvement of the SN early in pathophysiological progression of PD, many DTI studies have focused on ROI analysis of the SN. For example, reduced FA of SN in subjects with early-stage PD compared with controls was observed by Vaillancourt et al. ( ), whereas Liu et al. ( ) similarly found that FAs in the rostral, middle, and caudal areas of the SN were decreased significantly in subjects with early-stage PD compared with controls. Mangia et al. ( ) explored the SN and other brain locations from a multimodal MRI approach and reported neuronal degeneration of the SN in the early-PD group. However, not all studies have reported similar results. For instance, Pellizari et al. ( ) observed no differences in FA in the SN between early-stage PD and HC, although differences in AxD were reported. Similarly, Joshi et al. ( ) compared all DTI-derived metrics in 24 early-stage PD subjects and found increased MD in the SN. Finally, in a longitudinal study over almost 2 years, Loane et al. ( ) found no significant differences in DTI metrics at baseline, but significant differences in nigral FA (decrease in PD) and MD (increase in PD) metrics were observed at the follow-up time point. As a result, the authors hypothesized that diffusion metrics in the SN may be sensitive measures of disease progression. \n\nParkinson disease is often associated with olfactory dysfunction, and impaired sense of smell is one of the earliest clinical symptoms of PD, preceding even the classic motor signs ( ). Using ROI analysis, significant group differences in FA and MD have been observed in the anterior olfactory structures ( ). These results were confirmed by Rolheiser et al. ( ), who leveraged TBSS to reveal significant group differences between PD and controls in the anterior olfactory region, as well as the SN. Furthermore, reduced FA in WM associated with the central olfactory system was observed using TBSS in early-stage PD patients and was associated with a reduced ability to smell ( ). \n\nParkinson disease\u2013associated pathological changes are not isolated to the SN and olfactory regions. In fact, alterations have been observed in other WM areas, including the genu of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, putamen, external capsule, midbrain, superior cerebellum, and superior cerebellar peduncles ( ,  ). Using both ROI and tractography methods, Planetta et al. ( ) found that FA values were significantly reduced in PD in fibers projecting from the anterior nucleus, ventral anterior nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus. In addition, reduced FA values approached significance in the ventral lateral nucleus of patients with PD. Similarly, regions that have shown reduced FA using TBSS include the bilateral anterior corona radiata, upper corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiation, optic radiation, fornix, and corpus callosum, among others ( ,  ). In a study of 125 early-stage PD and 50 HC individuals, increased MD in PD subjects was observed in several WM locations, suggesting early axonal damage ( ). On the other hand, some studies have reported no significant differences between early-stage PD and controls ( ,  ), whereas higher FA values in several WM locations have also been reported ( ). \n\nGiven the evidence of widespread WM changes, whole-brain metrics may be of interest. Tessa et al. ( ) previously used whole-brain histogram analysis to compare FA metrics between controls and   de novo   drug-naive PD (  n   = 27), the latter of which was divided in tremor-dominant, akinetic-rigid, and mixed types. Increased FA was observed in patients with PD, which was more pronounced in patients with the akinetic-rigid subtype. Considering the use of whole-brain analysis, these results support the hypothesis that widespread neuropathology exists at the time of clinical onset, possibly driven by the inclusion of GM in whole-brain analysis. Connectome analysis has also shown significant differences in the WM-derived structural connectome associated with PD ( ,  ,  ). More specifically, lower global efficiency and global clustering coefficient have been observed in PD compared with HCs ( ). Arrigo et al. ( ) found significant alterations in optic radiation connectivity distribution, a significant increase in optic radiation MD, and a significant reduction in WM concentration in early-stage PD. Finally, Tinaz et al. ( ) investigated the structural and functional organization in PD subjects, finding reduced WM connectivity in frontoparietal\u2013striatal nodes compared to controls, but no change in modular organization of the WM tracts. A recent study by Mishra et al. ( ) reported that there is an early-stage PD-specific WM-derived connectome comprising pathophysiologically relevant regions and that the overall connectivity in early-stage PD in these regions is significantly higher than that compared to HC. Additionally, PD groups have shown reduction in functional local network metrics in many nodes distributed across the connectome ( ). \n\nSeveral studies have sought to correlate DTI findings with clinical metrics, including functional and cognitive measures, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The cross-sectional results have been mixed with both ROI analysis and TBSS, with some studies showing no correlations between DTI-derived metrics and clinical measures ( ,  ) and other studies reporting significant correlations, particularly in the caudate nucleus ( ,  ). Minett et al. ( ) found that at baseline patients with early-stage PD had significantly higher MD relative to HC, and in patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment, higher MD was significantly correlated with lower attention and executive function scores. In this longitudinal study, DTI-derived WM microstructural changes were assessed as potential prognostic biomarkers of worsening motor features or cognitive decline in patients with PD. At follow-up, frontal MD increased significantly when comparing patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment with HC. In another longitudinal study over 18 months, patients with early-stage PD with unilateral disease were shown to have higher rates of microstructural changes compared to patients with later-stage PD with bilateral disease, suggesting that substantial microstructural changes occur during the early stages of disease ( ). Gray matter changes have also been implicated in PD-associated cognitive impairment, where reduced cortical microstructural integrity was associated with reduced cognitive performance in early-stage PD patients ( ). \n\nWhile many of the aforementioned studies have used subject sample sizes on the order of 20 to 30, several studies have leveraged the PPMI database that features larger patient enrollment and longitudinal data, along with clinical metrics. Using ROI analysis, Schuff et al. ( ) analyzed WM abnormalities in 153 early-stage drug-naive   de novo   PD and compared these measures with 67 HC from the PPMI database, finding a marginally non-significant interaction between nigral FA and disease status. However, significant interactions between WM regions and disease status have been found in several other non-PPMI studies ( ,  ,  ). Analyzing longitudinal PPMI data using VBA, Taylor et al. ( ) found significantly increased FA in brainstem, cerebellar, anterior corpus callosal, inferior frontal, and inferior fronto-occipital WM and increased MD in primary sensorimotor and supplementary motor regions. After 1 year, PD patients showed a significantly stronger decline in FA compared to HC in the optic radiation and corpus callosum, as well as parietal, occipital, posterior temporal, posterior thalamic, and vermis GM. The authors postulate that these findings are in line with spatiotemporal patterns of \u03b1-synuclein, in both WM and cortical GM. Diffusion tensor imaging\u2013derived metrics of the nigrostriatal tract were shown to have a systematic abnormalities in 50 PD patients from PPMI using tractography; in addition, variations in FA and RD of the nigrostriatal tract were associated with the degree of motor deficits in PD patients ( ). \n\nGiven the numerous permutations of DTI analysis methods, Mishra et al. ( ) performed a systematic comparison of various postprocessing approaches used for identifying WM differences using DTI data from PPMI database. Region-of-interest\u2013based analysis, VBA with varying spatial smoothing, and two widely used skeletonized approaches (TBSS and tensor-based registration with DTI-TK) were compared in a group of 81 early-stage PD and 44 HCs from PPMI. Both skeletonized approaches revealed significant negative correlations for FA with disease duration, although DTI-TK was found to be more accurate for assessing disease progression. However, no analytic techniques showed any group difference in any region between early-stage PD and HC. These types of comparisons provide context for studies that have shown conflicting findings with different analysis pipelines and highlight the importance of standardization of DTI analysis. \n\nTo provide a more comprehensive view of early-stage PD-related neuropathological changes, several studies have combined imaging metrics with different underlying pathophysiological correlates. Wei et al. ( ) and Pelizzari et al. ( ) combined microstructural DTI-derived metrics with perfusion using arterial spin labeling to increase diagnostic accuracy for early-stage PD. In those studies, both FA and cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal WM regions were decreased in early-stage PD and mid-late PD compared with HC. In addition, FA was decreased in the SN, while hypoperfusion was observed in the frontal/occipital WM regions. Several authors have also used DTI together with VBM, which can detect subtle brain volumetric changes using structural images, to investigate the relationship between WM tracts, GM volume and PD. These studies found reduced WM microstructural integrity and reduction of GM volume in PD subjects in several regions, such as cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, striatum, and the frontal, temporal, limbic, and paralimbic areas ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nSleep disorders, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, may coincide with early-stage PD, and the combination of sleep disorders and early-stage PD has been associated with more advanced disease status, despite similar clinical characteristics and cognitive performance ( ). Parkinson disease patients with sleep disorders have shown regions of reduced cortical GM volume, as assessed by VBM, and WM changes, most notably reduced FA using TBSS, compared with those who did not have sleep disorders, though not significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons. In a separate study, cortical and subcortical alterations in   de novo   PD patients were observed using VBA-DTI ( ); notably, many of these changes occurred in the brainstem, specifically the pontine tegmentum, which has been implicated in the regulation of sleep cycles ( ). \n\nMood disorders, including depression, apathy, and anxiety, have been associated with more advanced PD stages and may be related to dopaminergic depletion ( ); however, these neuropsychiatric conditions have also been implicated in early-stage disease and may have a different underlying etiology ( ). Gou et al. found no significant WM microstructural differences between depressed and non-depressed PD groups using TBSS ( ), a finding that was replicated by Lacey et al. using data from PPMI ( ). However, connectivity analysis revealed significant network changes associated with PD patients with depression ( ). Parkinson disease with apathy has also been associated with bilateral microstructural alterations in the medial corticostriatal limbic system; more specifically, decreased FA and increased MD were observed in the anterior striatum and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, along with concomitant serotonergic dysfunction ( ). \n\nWhile most studies have sought to differentiate between PD and HC groups, some studies have assessed the potential of DTI biomarkers to differentiate PD subgroups. In one study, decreased FA was observed in the SN using ROI analysis in early and mid\u2013late PD patients compared with healthy subjects, but there were no significant differences in the same metrics between early-stage PD and mid\u2013late PD groups ( ). These results suggest that SN changes occur early in the pathology of PD and rapidly reach a plateau, such that longer disease duration is not indicative of increased nigral microstructural changes. Comparing early-stage PD and neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism (AP), higher MD in the centrum semiovale, body of the corpus callosum, putamen, external capsule, midbrain, superior cerebellum, and superior cerebellar peduncles has been observed in AP ( ). Another study using ROI analysis across PD subgroups found that widespread microstructural changes were present only in late-stage PD groups and not in early and moderate PD groups ( ). The authors further suggest that standard DTI methods may not be sensitive to early PD pathology, which may indicate a role for more advanced methods. \n\n\n### Free-Water Algorithms for DTI Correction \n  \nThe complex organization of brain tissue, in combination with the relatively large voxel size in dMRI acquisition, results in PVE in diffusion tensor measurements. Consequently, DTI-derived metrics are influenced by the combined contributions of different brain tissue compartments, including CSF and/or extracellular free water ( ). Free-water is defined as water molecules that neither experience flow nor are restricted by their surroundings. In the human brain, free water is found in CSF within the ventricles and around the brain parenchyma. For instance, CSF has a relatively large diffusion coefficient compared with that of the brain parenchyma, such that PVE in the periventricular regions and the sulci may overestimate the ADC values by 15\u201330% ( ). Several methods can be employed to remove free-water contributions, such as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery diffusion-weighted imaging (FLAIR-DWI) ( ) or the free-water correction algorithm developed by Pasternak et al. ( ) for single-shell acquisitions and later extended to multishell acquisitions ( ). Planetta et al. ( ) used a free-water DTI algorithm in the context of early-stage PD patients taking rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor used to treat PD, and found that the +rasagiline group had less free water in the posterior SN and better performance on a coordination task than the \u2013rasagiline group. However, interpretation of changes in free-water measures from single-shell dMRI acquisitions must be interpreted cautiously, as the measures are biased at crossing-fiber regions ( ), which make up approximately 90% of WM voxels ( ). \n\n\n### Beyond DTI: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging \n  \nAlthough DTI is widely used to study WM organization, its inherent assumption of a Gaussian distribution results in an inability to resolve tracts in voxels with complex fiber arrangements ( ). To overcome this issue, other techniques such as DKI have been developed. Kurtosis is a statistical measure of the deviation from a Gaussian distribution (which is the assumed distribution for DTI), and thus, DKI-based methods can quantify non-Gaussian diffusion ( ). This technique is largely based on the same type of pulse sequences employed for DTI, but DKI requires multishell dMRI at higher   b   values than those conventionally utilized for DTI analysis. \n\nFor DKI, the natural logarithm of the diffusion-weighted signal can be approximated by an expansion in terms of the   b   values: \n\nwhere   S  (  b  ) is the signal intensity,   D   is the apparent diffusion coefficient, and   K   is the apparent diffusional kurtosis, and the term   O  (  b  ) is the Taylor expansion for power of   b   > 2. In the case of Gaussian diffusion,   K   is zero, and Equation (5) reduces to the standard DTI equation. Analogous to DTI, this equation is solvable to yield the diffusion kurtosis tensor  . \n\nDiffusion kurtosis imaging processing is only slightly more complex than DTI processing, although DKI provides a significantly more complete characterization of water diffusion and tissue structure. \n\nDiffusion kurtosis imaging provides the same set of diffusion parameters as DTI (DKI-FA, DKI-RD, DKI-AD, and DKI-MD), in addition to mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (RK), and axial kurtosis (AK), which are the most commonly used kurtosis metrics. Similar to DTI, AK is the primary eigenvalue of the apparent kurtosis tensor along the main diffusion direction, whereas RK is the average of the kurtosis coefficients on the equatorial plane. Kurtosis anisotropy is the DKI analog to FA ( ). \n\nEven though DKI is more complete than DTI and is able to quantify non-Gaussian diffusion in the brain, DKI-derived diffusion parameters (e.g., DKI-FA) are limited in their sensitivity to detect abnormalities in WM regions with complex fiber arrangements ( ). Therefore, the kurtosis indices, such as MK, may be more accurate metrics for WM structural analysis using DKI. \n\n\n### DKI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nDiffusion kurtosis imaging has been used in several studies to assess the early stages of PD. Zhang et al. ( \u2013 ) published several studies with DKI in early-stage PD with both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. In these studies, MK in the SN was significantly increased in PD compared with HCs. Additionally, MK in the SN was positively correlated with the H&Y score staging and part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). In another study, Surova et al. ( ) used DKI to study 105 patients with early-stage PD. They found differences in DTI and DKI metrics between PD subjects and HC in the putamen, thalamus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, which were also associated with increased disease severity. Guan et al. ( ) used ROI analysis of DKI metrics to study advanced and early-stage PD, and MK was found to be significantly lower in bilateral SN in patients with both early-stage and advanced PD than in controls. In addition, MK in the left SN was significantly lower in patients with advanced PD than in those with early-stage PD. However, no differences in FA or MD values were observed between the PD and control groups in that study, and no significant correlations between MK, FA, or MD values and the UPDRS scores were observed. \n\n\n### Beyond DTI: Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging \n  \nNeurite orientation dispersion and density imaging is a practical dMRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons   in vivo   ( ). Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging distinguishes between three microstructural environments: intracellular, extracellular, and CSF compartments. Each compartment affects water diffusion in a unique way ( ) and gives rise to a separate normalized MR signal. The full normalized signal,   S  (  A  ), which includes all environments, is written as follows: \n\nwhere   A   and   v   are the normalized signal and volume fraction of the intracellular compartment, respectively;   A   is the normalized signal of the extracellular compartment; and   A   and   v   are the normalized signal and volume fraction of the CSF compartment, respectively ( ). By fitting Equation (6), it is possible to obtain   v  ,   v  , and the concentration parameter of the Watson distribution (  k  ), which is a parameter related to   A  . Using   k  , the orientation dispersion (OD) index can be defined as follows: \n\nNeurite orientation dispersion and density imaging\u2013derived indices have been suggested as imaging biomarkers in early-stage PD, as discussed below. Moreover, NODDI-derived metrics are less sensitive to partial volume effects than DTI ( ), which are known to reduce the accuracy of DTI-derived metrics. \n\n\n### NODDI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nNeurite orientation dispersion and density imaging has been used in only two studies in early-stage PD. Andica et al. ( ) used both NODDI and tractography to compare   v  , OD, and   v   between groups of PD and HCs. They found that the contralateral distal   v   of the nigrostriatal pathway was significantly lower in PD patients than in HCs. However, no correlations were detected between different NODDI indices and disease duration or motor symptom severity. Surova et al. ( ) used NODDI, in addition to DKI as discussed above, and ROI analysis in 105 patients with PD, finding increased   v   in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and decreased   v   in the corticospinal tract. \n\n\n### Beyond DTI: Q-Space Diffeomorphic Reconstruction \n  \nIn addition to limitations of DTI related to non-Gaussian diffusion, other known limitations such as its inability to independently resolve crossing fibers ( ) and sensitivity to PVE, result in DTI-derived metrics that reflect a weighted average of multiple diffusion components within a voxel. These limitations reduce the accuracy of DTI-derived metrics and also of WM tractography. For instance, in voxels with multiple tract orientations, a decrease in FA for one of these fiber populations may result in a contradictory increase in the overall FA ( ). To partially overcome this issue, dMRI techniques such as QSDR have been developed. \n\nThe orientation distribution function (ODF) can be used to characterize the diffusion distribution of fiber populations, thus overcoming crossing fiber limitations. To calculate the ODF, diffusion data can be acquired using a single-shell diffusion sampling scheme, also known as high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) ( ), or a grid sampling scheme, which is known as diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) acquisition ( ). However, studies using ODF to characterize the diffusion distribution may also suffer from partial volume effects. To overcome these effects, the spin distribution function (SDF) can be obtained from generalized Q-sampling imaging (GQI) ( ), where SDF represents the proportion of spins undergoing diffusion in different orientations. Q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction is an advanced method to calculate transformed SDFs in any given deformation field that satisfies diffeomorphism ( ). Therefore, QSDR can resolve crossing fibers with substantially smaller impact of partial volume effects. \n\nThe quantitative anisotropy (QA), which is defined as the proportion of spins that undergo diffusion along a given fiber orientation, can characterize the diffusion behavior of a fiber population. Quantitative anisotropy is calculated from the peak orientations on an SDF. Each peak orientation defines a QA value: \n\nwhere \u03c8  is the SDF,   Z   is the SDF scaling constant, \u00e2 is the orientation of the fiber defined by the local maximum of the SDF, and   I  (\u03c8 ) is the background isotropic component, which can \n\nbe approximated by the minimum value of the SDF. With QSDR and the QA index, it is possible to run subsequent analysis, such as VBA (through the normalized QA; nQA = QA/[max QA value]), tractography, and connectome analyses ( ). \n  \n (A)   Q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction using DSI Studio. gFA, QA, ISO (represents background isotropic diffusion contributed from CSF), and the ODF visualization are shown.

The false tracks are colored in black, whereas accurate trajectories are coded by directional color. The tractographies using FA, GFA, and anatomical information show substantially more false tracks than do those using QA. The best performance can be observed in the tractography using QA and the grid dataset. Reproduced with permission from Yeh et al. ( ). \n  \n\n### QSDR in Early-Stage PD \n  \nAll QSDR studies in early-stage PD used patients from the PPMI database. Ghazi Sherbaf et al. ( ) published several studies by using this technique utilizing PPMI database. They studied PD subjects with depression and sleep behavior disorder ( \u2013 ). Additionally, they found that PD patients exhibited negative correlations between QA and insulinlike growth factor 1 level in several WM locations, including the middle cerebellar peduncle, left and right cingulum, and genu and splenium of the corpus callosum ( ); additionally, they demonstrated that the blood marker apolipoprotein A-1 can predict microstructural changes in WM regions in early-stage PD patients with undisturbed cognition and mild motor disability ( ). Utilizing QA in a connectome analyses, Haghshomar et al. ( ) previously studied the structural correlation of various WM tracts in 81 early-stage PD patients with the whole-blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and identified that the QA index correlated with this ratio in the bilateral cingulum, body and left crus of fornix, bilateral corticospinal tract, body and splenium of corpus callosum, and superior cerebellar peduncle. In another study of 85 subjects with PD, connectome analysis of QA revealed a positive association with WM density in bilateral corticospinal tract in the H&Y stage 1 patients, whereas a negative association was observed in the genu of the corpus callosum and bilateral cingulum in H&Y stages 1 and 2 groups ( ). In addition, associations between autonomic functional scores and structural brain connectivity in PD were found. Wen et al. ( ) used TBSS with graph-theoretical and network-based analyses with QSDR reconstruction to compare WM regional and network features between early-stage PD [tremor-dominant and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes] and HC groups. Using TBSS and QSDR, tremor-dominant patients showed increased FA and decreased RD and AxD in several areas. Additionally, motor severity had mild to moderate correlations with FA and RD in the genu of the corpus callosum in tremor-dominant subjects, whereas motor severity had strong correlations with FA and RD of multiple association tracts in PIGD subjects. On the other hand, network-based statistical analysis did not reveal any subnetworks with connectivity differences between groups. \n\nStructural network alterations have also been investigated from healthy aging to the prodromal phase of PD to early-stage PD ( ). Compared with HCs and   de novo   PD patients, prodromal PD patients showed significantly increased small-world-ness, higher clustering coefficient, and greater local connectivity between regions relating to motor, olfactory, and sleep functions. Parkinson disease patients without hyposmia have shown a significant decrease in global efficiency compared to controls using TBSS with graph-theoretical methods and network-based statistics ( ). Additionally, PD patients with hyposmia were shown to exhibit significantly reduced global and local efficiency, as well as a disrupted connection between the right medial orbitofrontal cortex and left rectus, with poorer frontal-related cognitive functioning. Utilizing connectome analysis in 18 early-stage PD and 17 prodromal PD patients, Sanjari Moghaddam et al. ( ) investigated the microstructural association of olfaction in prodromal PD as compared to early-stage drug-naive PD patients. Their studies suggested that individuals with prodromal PD have a significantly higher QA as compared to PD patients in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles and right arcuate fasciculus. \n\nWen et al. ( ) analyzed two different groups of early-stage PD (H&Y stages 1 and 2) using TBSS and QSDR connectome analysis. They found that the earlier stage PD (H&Y stage 1) was associated with higher FA and lower MD and RD in callosal, projection, and association fibers than both HCs and higher-stage PD (H&Y stage 2). The timeline of these alterations between HC and H&Y stage 2 PD was hypothesized to be indicative of compensatory mechanisms arising from early dopaminergic dysfunction in the SN, although further studies are needed to confirm the presence of these neural compensation mechanisms. In addition, motor severity was inversely correlated with FA and positively correlated with MD and RD in PD patients. Moreover, connectome analysis also revealed increased WM density in the aforementioned tracts in PD patients, compared with HCs. \n\nFinally, olfactory dysfunction has been investigated in relation to QSDR findings. Multiple regression analysis in prodromal PD demonstrated positive association between the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score and connectivity in left and right subgenual cingulum, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, left corticospinal tract, left parietopontine, left corticothalamic tract, and the body and the splenium of corpus callosum. Sobhani et al. ( ) studied olfactory dysfunction in PD, confirming a discriminative role for UPSIT score in identifying WM microstructure changes in early-PD subjects. \n\n\n### Software for DTI Analysis \n  \nDifferent software packages have been used for diffusion analysis in early-stage PD ( ). Most of the available software provides both preprocessing and processing steps within the same pipeline. A standalone preprocessing method, DTIprep, may also be used, which performs an automatic study-specific protocol for DWI/DTI quality control and preparation. After preprocessing, multiple software packages are available to generate DTI-derived metrics. FSL is one of the most widely used software packages for DTI analysis. FDT-FSL employs both linear least squares (LLS) and weighted linear least squares (WLLS) fitting procedures. CAMINO is another open-source software toolkit for dMRI processing. It employs LLS, WLLS, unconstrained non-linear optimization, and the robust estimation of tensors involving the outlier rejection (RESTORE) fitting algorithms. Robust fitting methods (RESTORE and iRESTORE), together with LLS fitting, can also be found in the tolerably obsessive registration and tensor optimization indolent software ensemble (TORTOISE) software. Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) is frequently used for fMRI analysis, but it can also be employed for DTI fitting (LLS and non-LLS). Diffusion spectrum imaging Studio is a tractography software tool that maps brain connections and correlates findings with neuropsychological disorders. It works with several dMRI methods, including DTI, GQI, QSDR, dMRI connectome analysis, and generalized deterministic fiber tracking. DTI Studio and Explore DTI are other reliable software packages for DTI fitting and dMRI analysis. FSL's probtrackx (within FDT) and the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (Tracula, within FreeSurfer) are both used for probabilistic tractography; DSI Studio and TrackVis are appropriate for deterministic tractography, whereas MRtrix contains both probabilistic and deterministic algorithms. Matlab toolboxes include the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) for dMRI-derived structural connectivity analysis, DTI and Fiber Tracking toolbox for DTI fitting and tractography, and NODDI toolbox for NODDI analysis. In several studies, authors used in-house software or MRI workstation software for DTI and DKI analysis. \n  \nList of the main software for dMRI data processing and analysis available. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Current State of dMRI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nOverall, dMRI has been widely used in research settings to investigate WM changes in early-stage PD. In general, DTI acquisition (and similarly DKI) is fairly standardized across vendors and sites, leading to high consistency for data acquisition. The vast majority (56 of 62) of studies included in this systematic review used two   b   values (typically   b   = 1,000 s/mm  and   b   = 0), although three studies used more   b   values (up to four   b   values), and three did not provide this information. More variability is observed in terms of the number of diffusion directions across studies, although the majority used more than 60 directions (37 of 62 studies). Several studies used 30 to 39 directions (seven studies) or 20 to 29 directions (12 studies). Only three studies used fewer than 20 directions. As stated above, more advanced methods require high angular resolution dMRI data, whereas even standard DTI may benefit from improved data acquisition. In general, more than 30 directions can be recommended, and multiple shells may enable improved quantification of dMRI metrics. Despite the similarity in acquisitions, analysis methods can vary widely across studies and are less standardized. \n\nAdditionally, the various preprocessing steps for diffusion data can lead to different findings. Echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions suffer from geometric and intensity distortions caused by static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is worse at higher field strengths; additionally, DTI images are susceptible to the distortions caused by eddy currents induced by large diffusion gradients. There are several methods to correct these issues as part of the preprocessing pipeline. For example, the FSL toolbox includes several tools, including eddy and top-up, which can be used alone or in concert to correct dMRI images. Moreover, the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio can have effect on the accuracy and reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics ( ), highlighting the importance of both acquisition and preprocessing steps. \n\nAnother important point to consider in light of the dMRI findings in early-stage PD is the effects of the different statistical methods used. Correction of   p  -values can be achieved in multiple ways and may vary across studies. For instance, the threshold-free cluster enhancement is a method for finding significant clusters without having to define binary clusters, whereas cluster-based thresholding methods are used to correct data for multiple comparisons. Often, the data are reported as family-wise error (FWE)-corrected, which means that the family-wise error rate is controlled. It is important to note that correction for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni or false discovery rate) is compulsory when analysis includes more than two groups (e.g., analysis of variance   post hoc   analysis) and/or when using multiple ROI analysis. \n\nDespite the lack of standardized methods, dMRI methods are increasingly used to understand whether dMRI-derived metrics suggesting WM disorganization are related to clinical presentation. Early-stage PD patients with non-motor symptoms, such as those with olfactory dysfunction or those with substantial SN dopaminergic neuron loss, have been analyzed with various dMRI techniques. Conventional single-tensor DTI models, as well as more sophisticated dMRI models such as DKI and NODDI, have independently suggested diffuse WM changes in early-stage PD, supporting the notion of early axonal damage in PD while simultaneously suggesting that PD pathology may go unrecognized until symptoms appear. Moreover, conventional DTI metrics such as FA and MD have displayed sensitivity to potentially identify earlier symptomatic regions, such as olfactory structures, using correlations with clinical presentations in predetermined ROI analysis. In addition, several studies have considered dMRI changes in GM ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), which may also be implicated in PD pathology. However, as GM lacks the microstructural organization of WM, interpretation of GM-DTI must be approached with caution. In contrast, NODDI has previously been shown to reflect the neurobiology of cortical microstructures ( ), suggesting that more advanced dMRI models may enable robust GM characterization in early-stage PD. \n\nHowever, studies have often displayed heterogeneous results, which may be at least partially attributable to the varying preprocessing and postprocessing steps and statistical approaches utilized. Early-stage PD patients are also heterogeneous in their clinical presentations, and this may further contribute to such varied findings. Although the combination of different dMRI acquisitions and analyses may yield new and more accurate information related to dMRI-derived WM structural disorganization and global connectivity changes in early-stage PD, dMRI has the capability to be developed as a useful neuroimaging tool for diagnosis and prognosis of early-stage PD by rigorously developing and enforcing a set of standardized acquisition and postprocessing tools. This will ultimately provide more reliable dMRI-derived neuroimaging biomarkers that are not only significantly different when compared to HC in early-stage PD, but also attempt to explain their correlations with clinical presentation. Altogether, these will in turn help to understand the neuropathological underpinnings of the progression of PD. Utilizing advanced dMRI methods that overcome some of the known limitations of DTI is also imperative, as measures derived through these advanced dMRI methods may help to understand tract-specific deterioration of WM organization in the progression of PD. Ultimately, ensuring standardization of patient recruitment, data acquisition, postprocessing analytical tools, and statistical approaches could move dMRI toward clinical implementation for identifying dMRI-derived neuroimaging biomarkers. \n\n\n### Challenges of dMRI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nAs previously mentioned, conflicting results are often reported in dMRI studies on PD subjects. The small sample size of participants, heterogeneous clinical presentation, and sex imbalance may be responsible for such non-reproducible results reported in the literature. Moreover, the heterogeneity of findings may also be related to the dMRI data acquisition. It is important to emphasize that dMRI acquisitions with fewer than 30 directions may not correctly estimate DTI metrics. For robust estimation of anisotropy, at least 20 unique sampling orientations are necessary, whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations are required for robust estimation of both tensor orientation and MD. Diffusion schemes with a lower number of sampling orientations may introduce bias and spurious correlations between tensor orientation and apparent diffusion characteristics ( ). Hence, acquiring data with at least 45 to 60 diffusion-encoding directions might help to better resolve crossing fibers, may aid in connectome analyses, and can be generally recommended for dMRI data acquisition. \n\nThe trend to acquire multishell dMRI data with multiple   b   values is increasing and is also widely recommended. With the advent of simultaneous multislice techniques, it is now clinically feasible to acquire high angular resolution data with multiple shells in clinically acceptable time of approximately 20 min. Acquiring such high angular resolution data with multiple shells permits estimation of advanced dMRI-derived metrics, such as free-water corrected DTI metrics, DKI-derived metrics, and NODDI-metrics. In the future, the sensitivity and specificity of each of these measures should be compared with disease progression to identify the most reproducible, sensitive, and specific dMRI-derived neuroimaging biomarkers for understanding neuropathological underpinnings of PD. \n\nAnother possible source of different results lies in the different postprocessing software and statistical approaches used. The algorithms used for tensor fitting of diffusion-weighted data can have substantial effects on the results, not only for PD, but also for other diseases ( ,  ). For instance, although LLS fitting model is fast, it incorrectly assumes that data outliers are homogeneously distributed, and therefore it fails to appropriately deweight their contributions. On the other hand, WLLS is slower than the LLS but assigns a weight according to how much the original noise variation is affected by logarithmic transform of the data. While more robust fitting algorithms are available, such as RESTORE and iRESTORE, these are not frequently used because of more complicated pipelines. Identifying the most reproducible statistical approach and the best preprocessing and postprocessing tools are important unmet needs in analysis of dMRI data. \n\n\n### New Avenues for dMRI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nWe previously discussed that DTI has several limitations related to an assumption of Gaussian diffusion, presence of crossing fibers, and partial volume effects. Each of the methods presented above that move beyond standard DTI has some aspect that overcomes these limitations, such as DKI to characterize deviations from Gaussian diffusion, NODDI to characterize and minimize partial volume effects, and QSDR to characterize both intravoxel fiber orientation heterogeneity and partial volume effects. Network-based approaches that do not assume the caliber or density of axons in WM, but rather only the orientation of axons, have seen a surge in recent years since PD has been postulated as a network disorder. In several early-stage PD studies, these advanced approaches have been used to overcome DTI-related limitations, although other options are available and have not been investigated. For example, DSI ( ) is a technique that can resolve the fiber crossing limitation; however, DSI requires both more time for acquisition than standard DTI and larger pulsed field gradients. \n\nWhile each of these methods may overcome a fundamental limitation for DTI, these methods may have different limitations themselves ( ). For instance, DKI and NODDI suffer from their inherent mathematical assumptions that require data collection methods and analysis that may not be practical or feasible. Interpreting the free-water contribution as applied to DTI is also challenging. Studying network topology through WM-derived structural connectivity may be limited because there is no consensus on the choice of tracking algorithm or edge weights. However, high angular resolution dMRI data acquisition at multiple shells in a clinically acceptable time lends hope in applying and standardizing these advanced dMRI techniques, while simultaneously permitting the incorporation of metrics from these advanced dMRI techniques into network-based analysis. \n\n\n### Outlook for Future of dMRI in Early-Stage PD \n  \nThe clinical management of PD faces a significant challenge because moderate to severe neurodegeneration has been shown to be present before the diagnosis is rendered. In addition, the classic presentation of motor disability in PD is shown to co-occur with non-motor symptoms such as changes in mood and behavior, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and olfactory dysfunction. The need for neuroimaging biomarkers to detect initial neuropathological changes is crucial to optimize patient care via correct diagnosis and treatment. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging\u2013based metrics have shown significant but subtle changes in early-stage PD in many areas, such as the motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortices, corpus callosum, and SN ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, non-motor features common to PD, including olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep behavior disorder, cognitive impairment, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression, can appear in the early stages of PD, providing rationale for screening for PD-like pathology ( ). While all of these symptoms have been studied with DTI, the results have been limited or heterogeneous ( ,  ). Although hallmark regions such as the SN have been extensively studied using DTI, other regions, along with corresponding hallmarks of PD pathology, should be examined more extensively via advanced dMRI techniques. Additionally, further studies and the inclusion of advanced dMRI methods may aid in establishing more coherent knowledge of WM changes in PD-associated non-motoric symptoms, possibly providing neuroimaging-based biomarkers and thus creating an avenue for advancement of patient care and treatment. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nRW conceived of the presented idea.

In addition, the normal-sized PVSs (nPVSs) have not been well-studied. With high-resolution 7T-MRI, we studied nPVSs burden in BG, thalamus, midbrain and centrum semiovale. The numbers and volume of nPVSs were assessed in 10 healthy controls, 10 PD patients without FOG, 20 with FOG [10 tremor dominant (TD), 10 non-TD subtype].

In this proof of concept study, we found that the nPVS burden of bilateral and right BG were significantly higher in freezers. A negative correlation existed between the tremor score and BG-nPVSs count. A positive correlation existed between the levodopa equivalent daily dose and BG-nPVSs count. The nPVS burden correlated with the progression to FOG in PD, but the distribution and burden of nPVS differ in TD vs. non-TD subtypes. High resolution 7T-MRI is a sensitive and reliable tool to evaluate BG-nPVS, and may be a useful imaging marker for predicting gait impairment that may evolve into FOG in PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nFreezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom in the advanced stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). FOG increases the risk of falls and fall-related injuries with devastating impact on the quality of life of individuals with PD, often triggering a downward spiral of frailty and leading to depression, social isolation, activity avoidance, and fear of falling [ \u2013 ]. While classically occurring in advanced PD, FOG and falls can be seen in earlier stages, particularly in individuals who suffer from the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype, when compared to the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype [ \u2013 ]. \n\nThe mechanism of FOG in PD has been intensively studied. The \u201cinterference model\u201d describes function interruption between cortical structures and brainstem regions involved in gait control possibly contributing to FOG [ ,  ]. Similarly, the \u201cdecoupling model of FOG\u201d suggests that a breakdown in coupling between posture preparation by the supplemental motor area and step initiation by the motor cortex may be responsible for the \u201cstart hesitation\u201d in FOG [ ]. It has been suggested that FOG may be due to a failure to generate adequate amplitudes of the intended movement [ ]. The anatomical basis might be the failure of structural and functional integrity in the locomotion control system. For example, the widespread white matter damage involving sensorimotor-related and extramotor pathways was reported in PD-FOG patients. Individuals with diffused small vessel disease can frequently manifest Parkinsonian symptoms, while neuroimaging demonstrates diffused white matter hyperintensities (WMH). In addition, more severe WMH was found in the PIGD subtype of PD [ \u2013 ]. Left temporal WMH is related to falls in idiopathic PD [ ]. Taken together, the white matter integrity and the subcortical network [involving regions such as the basal ganglia (BG), the thalamus and the mesencephalic locomotion center] are essential to maintain gait and balance. When damaged, FOG and balance impairment can occur. \n\nPerivascular spaces (PVSs) are pial-lined interstitial fluid-filled spaces surrounding the penetrating blood vessels, which are commonly observed in the BG, white matter centrum semiovale (CSO), midbrain and subcortical white matter regions [ ,  ]. The mechanism of PVS dilation remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that enlarged PVSs (ePVSs) are associated with normal aging [ ,  ]; cerebral small vessel disease [ \u2013 ]; neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease [ ,  ,  ] and PD [ ,  ,  ]; stroke [ ,  \u2013 ]; neuroinflammation; and demyelination [ ,  ]. Within BG, ePVSs are closely associated with older age, cerebral atrophy, lacunar stroke and cognitive impairment [ \u2013 ]. In PD, ePVSs and the severity of the PVS in BG are related to the severity of motor symptoms [ ,  ], cognitive dysfunction [ ], and future cognitive decline in individuals with normal cognition [ ]. \n\nSince ePVSs are correlated with PD motor and cognitive impairment, one can postulate that the distribution and volume of the normal-sized PVSs (nPVSs) may have certain clinical significance in PD. Previous studies have mainly focused on ePVSs due to limits in imaging resolution. NPVSs are typically invisible due to small size in the range of 0.13-0.96 mm [ ]. Seven Tesla (7T) MRI, with increased spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, increases the detection of nPVSs [ ,  ]. The 7T sequences have been optimized to provide detailed assessment of distributions of nPVSs in the white matter and subcortical nuclei [ ]. \n\nIn this proof of concept study, with 7T MRI, we investigated the clinical and neuroimaging significance of nPVS in important locomotion centers, including the BG, thalamus, midbrain, and CSO in PD freezers with different motor phenotypes. We hypothesized that the count and volume of nPVSs in BG may be different compared to those of age-matched healthy controls (HCs). The nPVSs burden of BG could potentially serve as a biomarker for PD gait impairment, and may further be a factor in distinguishing the motor subtypes in PD patients. \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the HCs, PD patients without FOG [FOG(-)], PD patients with FOG tremor dominant subtype [FOG(TD)], and those with FOG, but non-TD type [FOG(TD-)] are shown in  . There were no significant differences found in age, sex ratio, vascular risk factors, WMH burden and education level among the four groups. A majority of participants in the two FOG groups had moderate to severe degree of FOG ( ). Among the three PD groups, tremor score was significantly higher in the FOG(TD) group. The axial motor score, akinetic score, Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were higher in the freezers. \n   Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.    \nData were presented as mean \u00b1 SD.

NPVS number and volume calculation of PD subgroups and HCs groups were performed ( ). Test-retest reliability using the two-way mixed model for absolute agreement over a one-month interval reached 0.79 and 0.80 for nPVSs number and volume of BG region, 0.72 and 0.74 of thalamic region, 0.89 and 0.93 for the CSO region, and 0.77 and 0.83 of the midbrain, respectively. \n  \n Comparison of imaging resolution between 7T and 3T MRI for nPVS.

An overall positive correlation between WMH burden and BG-nPVS (r = 0.37, p = 0.02,  ) for all 40 participants was found. There were no correlations between nPVS burden and the UPDRS-III as well as other clinical parameters. There were no correlations between BG-nPVS volume and clinical parameters. There was no difference in the nPVS count and burden in the other areas assessed, nor was there any clinical correlation detected. \n  \n Correlation between BG nPVS burden with clinical features and WMH score.

First, we established that 7T MRI could be a reliable tool in assessing nPVS. The significance of normal sized nPVS in BG has not been well studied partially due to the challenges associated with nPVS quantitation using lower resolution MRI scanners. Conversely, using a 7T MRI scanner with the higher field strength makes it possible to quantitate nPVSs. \n\nPVSs are microscopic but visible on MRI when enlarged with the widely used 1.5 and 3T scanner. PVSs are commonly seen in healthy adults, in BG and CSO in up to 60% of individuals [ ]. There is clinical relevance to PVS. PVSs that relate to small vessel diseases are contributing factors to stroke and dementia [ ,  ]. It has also been proposed that ePVS is relevant to the development of neurodegenerative disease [ ]. In PD patients, periventricular WMH, brain atrophy, and BG-ePVSs have been noted to impact motor and cognitive functions [ ,  ]. A previous study has shown that vascular factors might be involved in the pathophysiology of PIGD motor phenotype [ ]. Postural and gait control involves integration of sensorimotor, BG, thalamus and cerebellum circuitries [ ]. A recent study exploring the association between small-vessel diseases and motor symptoms of PD showed different clinical association. A close association between ePVS in BG and the tremor score, as well as between deep WMH and the axial motor score were seen [ ]. However, this study did not explore the correlations with FOG. \n\nThe current study demonstrated a link between motor phenotypes and BG-nPVS burden. We first showed that nPVS burden in the BG was significantly higher in PD patients with FOG than those without FOG and the control group. The nPVS burden was significantly higher in right BG and bilateral BG among the PD freezers. Lateralization of the structural and functional connectivities in the human brain was reported in multiple studies of FOG, and it was noted that FOG was strongly related to structural deficits in the right hemisphere\u2019s locomotor network [ \u2013 ]. Right hemisphere PD pathology has been associated with more impairments in multiple cognitive domains, including verbal recall, semantic verbal fluency, visuospatial analysis, and attention span [ ]; it is also related to slower gait [ ] and poorer axial mobility [ ]. Functional connectivity was reduced within the executive-attention network in FOG patients within the right middle frontal gyrus [ ]. In our study, it is hard to conclude whether the lateralization is significant due to the small sample size. \n\nWe observed a less severe nPVS burden with the initial motor phenotype being TD subtype than the non-TD subtypes in PD freezers. The negative correlation between the tremor score and the nPVS number of BG may partially explain why the TD subtype carries a better prognosis. Response to levodopa therapy differs in PD subtypes, and it is known that axial symptoms, i.e. gait and balance tend to be less responsive to dopaminergic agents [ ,  ]. The higher LEDD dose in the freezers and the positive relationship between LEDD and BG-nPVS number are consistent with the previous observations that poorer levodopa response occurs when higher damage to the neurocircuitry is evident in the PIGD subtype. \n\nWe have shown a positive correlation between WMH burden and BG-nPVS. Given the known correlation between WMH and gait deficit in PD [ \u2013 ], and the evolving evidence of BG-ePVSs and motor symptoms [ ,  ], and cognitive dysfunction [ ,  ] in PD, our study suggested that increased nPVS in the BG region may act as a biomarker of gait decline if this finding holds in a larger study. Whether such changes relate to disruptions of the neural circuitry for gait control warrants further investigations with structural and functional connectivity studies. There was no association between CSO nPVS burden and PD motor symptoms, which is consistent with previous studies that the severity of axial motor impairments was not associated with the intensity of the periventricular WMH, suggesting certain functional distinctions between BG PVS and CSO PVS [ ,  ]. Although not well studied, nPVS distribution and burden may also reflect the similar degenerative processes with ePVS. The advance in recent imaging technologies make it possible to assess such microstructural changes   in vivo  , especially with high-field MRI scanners  .   Such assessment in relation to clinical parameters can potentially serve as biomarkers to monitor disease progression and more precisely differentiate disease phenotypes. \n\nThe strengths of our study include application of a novel tool to assess a potential imaging marker for PD. Although the literature on PVS in PD are growing, and there are more evidence to show the link between higher BG PVS burden and future cognitive decline [ ] and motor manifestations [ ]; using high resolution 7T MRI to compare the distribution and volume of nPVS in BG, and identifying how these parameters correlate with motor phenotype in PD is novel. We established a method and identified the role of nPVS in a specific group of PD patients, with a focus on the most disabling motor symptom, FOG. With technology advancing rapidly, building on knowledge and expertise with better imaging tools will aid further development in the field. We speculate that the research work with 7T MRI scanners will bring new insights, and soon add new knowledge to clinical practice. This proof of concept study encourages further investigation in future large-scale studies when 7T MRI scanners are more readily available. There are some limitations. This is a single-centered proof of concept study with relatively small sample size. Further, this study has a focus on FOG since it is one of the most disabling symptoms in PD and the mechanism is not fully clear. Due to these factors, we cannot extrapolate the findings to all PD patients, or explore the sex differences. Future large prospective studies will provide more insight to further investigate the utility of 7T MRI in evaluating nPVS as an imaging biomarker for disease phenotyping and trajectory. \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n  \nWe proposed a method using a high resolution 7T MRI to evaluate nPVS in BG to provide a potential imaging marker for predicting gait impairment in PD. The current study demonstrates that the nPVS burden correlates with the progression to FOG in PD patients, but the distribution and burden of nPVS may differ in people with or without tremor as initial motor presentation. High resolution 7T MRI is a sensitive and reliable tool to evaluate BG-nPVS, and may be a useful imaging marker for predicting gait impairment that may evolve into FOG in PD. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Study participants \n  \nTwenty PD patients with FOG, 10 FOG(TD), 10 FOG(TD-), 10 PD(FOG-), and 10 age- and sex-matched HCs were recruited from the Department of Neurology of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital ( ). The study was approved by the ethic committee of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Ethics No. 20200908-30). All patients were diagnosed with PD by a movement disorders neurologist based on the UK Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria [ ], and FOG was defined as a score of one or more on item 3 of the New FOG questionnaire (NFOG-Q) [ ] or by history and examination by two experienced movement disorders neurologists. All participants were examined by experienced neurologists with a full neurological examination. Patients with gait issues secondary to visual impairments, sensory ataxia, and orthopedic issues were excluded. We also excluded patients with atypical Parkinsonism. All participants with moderate to significant small vessel disease were excluded, and HCs reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Clinical assessment included Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for PD motor symptoms and NFOG-Q for FOG severity, respectively. Cognitive function and mental health were evaluated using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), HAMD and HAMA. LEDD was calculated [ ]. Other inclusion criteria of the study included disease duration \u2265 5 years, and Hoehn-Yahr stage < 4. Patients with significant cognitive deficits that prevent them from signing consent, and motor symptoms that were secondary to other etiologies were excluded. Based on the initial motor phenotypes, PD-FOG patients were divided into two groups, FOG(TD) and FOG(TD-) (PIGD and indeterminate) [ ]. Patients\u2019 motor function was assessed during the defined off-medication state after dopaminergic medications were on hold for more than 12 hours. Repeat motor examination was performed after patients reported ON with a supra-ON dose of LED (150% of the regular morning dose in Levodopa/carbidopa formula). Cognitive examination and other questionnaires were acquired during ON state. \n\n\n### MR imaging acquisition and analysis \n  \nMR images were acquired with a 7T Magnatom research system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence (voxel size: 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 2.4 mm , TR = 7000 ms, and TE = 66 ms), and two rapid gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence (voxel size: 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm , TR = 5000 ms, TI1/TI2 = 900/2750ms, TE = 2.3 ms, \u03b11/\u03b12 = 5\u00b0/3\u00b0). The nPVS burden, nPVS number and volume, were calculated with the axial T2-weighted TSE images via ITK-SNAP Software version 3.8 ( ) by a neurologist blinded to the participant\u2019s diagnosis and clinical features. For nPVS volume assessment, the border of each nPVS in the chosen slice was drawn manually. The nPVS volumes within the border were calculated automatically by the toolbox. The number of nPVSs were counted in the BG, thalamus, midbrain and CSO regions ( ). For BG, thalamus, and CSO, nPVSs were assessed on the slice unilaterally with the highest number for left or right side, followed by the sum of both sides. We then assess a single slice with the highest total nPVS count. For midbrain, given it is a small structure, nPVSs were counted within all slices showing midbrain. A 4-point visual rating scale (0 = no PVSs, 1 = PVSs < 10, 2 = 11-20 PVSs, 3 = 21-40 PVSs, 4 = PVSs > 40) were used to grade the severity of PVS [ ]. PVSs severity was then assessed using a semi-quantitative scale (none/mild = 0/1, moderate = 2, frequent/severe = 3/4) [ ]. All patients were included for test-retest reliability testing. The WMH burden for all participants was assessed by using a semi-quantitative rating scale [ ]. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistics (Version 22, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorial variables were analyzed with Fisher\u2019s exact test. Continuous variables were analyzed with One-way ANOVA. Correlation analyses between nPVS burdens, nPVS number and volume, and clinical features, namely MMSE, HAMA, HAMD, UPDRS-III and LEDD, were conducted using spearman correlation analysis. In addition, we also analyzed the correlation between nPVS number of BG and WMH burden.   P   < 0.05 was considered to define statistical significance. \n\nWith SPSS, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) was calculated. The ICC analysis assessed the test-retest reliability via the 2-way mixed model for absolute agreement. It was defined that ICC between 0.60-0.74 as good, and above 0.75 being excellent. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8351731, "text_md5": "240a4afacf01c3e7dedbd414fa3e3490", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 165], "journal": [166, 183], "publication_year": [185, 189], "title": [200, 294], "keywords": [308, 385], "abstract": [398, 1686], "body": [1695, 23372]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 34314380, "doi": "10.18632/aging.203343", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351731", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8351731"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351731\">8351731</a>", "list_title": "PMC8351731  Normal-sized basal ganglia perivascular space related to motor phenotype in Parkinson freezers"}

At single-joint level this is accompanied by reduced inhibition of antagonist muscle activity. While normal basal ganglia (BG) contributions to motor control include selecting appropriate muscles by inhibiting others, it is unclear how PD-related changes in BG function cause impaired movement initiation and inhibition at single-joint level. To further elucidate these changes we studied 4 right-hand movement tasks with fMRI, by dissociating activations related to abrupt movement initiation, inhibition and gradual movement modulation. Initiation and inhibition were inferred from ballistic and stepwise interrupted movement, respectively, while smooth wrist circumduction enabled the assessment of gradually modulated movement. Task-related activations were compared between PD patients (N\u200a=\u200a12) and healthy subjects (N\u200a=\u200a18). In healthy subjects, movement initiation was characterized by antero-ventral striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and premotor activations while inhibition was dominated by subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pallidal activations, in line with the known role of these areas in simple movement. Gradual movement mainly involved antero-dorsal putamen and pallidum. Compared to healthy subjects, patients showed reduced striatal/SN and increased pallidal activation for initiation, whereas for inhibition STN activation was reduced and striatal-thalamo-cortical activation increased. For gradual movement patients showed reduced pallidal and increased thalamo-cortical activation. We conclude that PD-related changes during movement initiation fit the (rather static) model of alterations in direct and indirect BG pathways. Reduced STN activation and regional cortical   increased   activation in PD during inhibition and gradual movement modulation are better explained by a dynamic model that also takes into account enhanced responsiveness to external stimuli in this disease and the effects of hyper-fluctuating cortical inputs to the striatum and STN in particular. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSuccessful motor performance in daily life implies that movements are adequately tuned to external conditions, particularly experienced by visual cues  \u2013 . Such performance requires a well-proportioned balance between initiation and inhibition of movement. In abrupt starting and stopping of movement, simultaneous contraction and relaxation of opposed muscle groups is obvious. Smooth movement execution, on the other hand, is achieved by gradual modulation of agonist and antagonist muscle activities. In task-related motor control, one may thus distinguish two levels of ongoing movement adjustments: (i) overall visuomotor control and (ii) co-ordination between various muscle groups to achieve a distinct movement. Regarding the latter, an adequate balance between initiation and inhibition is required to achieve the purpose of the intended movement  \u2013 . For example, a fast reach to catch a dropped object mainly involves abrupt initiation of agonist activation, whereas gentle object manipulation or smooth handwriting requires gradual agonist-antagonist adjustment achieved by the timed selection of specific muscles  ,  ,  . \n\nAt simple movement level, the basal ganglia (BG) and interconnected circuitry play a key role in the selection of appropriate muscles and inhibition of undesired motor activity  \u2013 . The role of the BG in tasks constituted by more complex movement patterns entails continuous modification of smooth movement, requiring a gradual selection of assemblies of muscle synergies. The precise function of the BG in the organization of initiation and inhibition of movement, however, is not clear and is quite complex  ,  \u2013 . \n\nThe prominent contribution of the BG to the organization of movement initiation and inhibition is also revealed by BG dysfunction evidenced by the symptoms and movement impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD)  \u2013 . Degeneration of the brain stem substantia nigra causes striatal dysfunction in PD   with impairment of movement initiation and inhibition as classical features. These impairments can be task-related, e.g. difficulty to start/stop walking  , whereas at single-joint level, impaired movement initiation   is also associated with insufficient inhibition of the antagonist muscle  . This suggests a relation with the clinical presentation of rigidity. Similarly, decreased ability of PD patients to perform movements smoothly   points at impaired gradual modulation of movement  . Dysfunction of BG input nuclei (striatum) leads to enhanced inhibition by BG output nuclei and subsequently reduced cortical activation  ,  . Although this \u2018classical\u2019 model may explain impaired movement initiation in PD, it does not fully explain insufficient movement inhibition and the poor gradual modulation of muscle synergies during movement execution in these patients  . \n\nThe present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study primarily aimed to identify PD-related changes in BG function involved in initiation, inhibition and gradual modulation of opposed muscle activity. To that end, we employed four manual movement tasks, characterized by abrupt starting and stopping during simple movements or compound muscle activities during more complex movements. All movement patterns concerned the same joint (the right wrist). Two of the present tasks were conceptually similar to tasks that we previously used to identify BG activations related to abrupt movement initiation and inhibition in healthy subjects  . In this respect, movement inhibition in our stop task concerned termination of ongoing movement and not the suppression of unwanted movement initiation. A novelty of the present study was the use of a manipulandum, with movement registration that also enabled visual feedback to the subject. In addition to abrupt flexion-extension tasks with movements along a single axis, we included two tasks requiring more elaborate adjustments in muscle activities. A task consisting of continuous circle movement was characterized by gradual modulation of muscle activity since it had no abrupt transitions  . However, this task also required more visuomotor control than the simple flexion-extension tasks, which implied that both gradual movement modulation and visuomotor transformation characterized this task as more complex than the flexion-extension tasks. A fourth experimental task (multi-directional, point to point step-tracking) was similarly associated with a high level of visuomotor complexity. Alike the circle task, multi-directional step-tracking movements result from variable muscle synergies needed to move the manipulandum towards different cued positions. However, in contrast to circle movement, this step-tracking task   included abrupt initiation and termination of movement. Specific comparisons between the experimental tasks (using a block-design analysis) enabled dissociation of BG activations related to modulation of compound muscle activities underlying movement execution from those related to the enhanced demand of visuomotor transformations. \n\nAside from the role of the BG in movement selection as discussed above, particularly the striatum may contribute to facilitation of cortico-cortical interactions required for visuomotor integration  ,  . The role of the striatum in visuomotor control is further revealed in PD patients who are more dependent on visual cues during movement execution  \u2013 . This implies that a dissociation of activations in BG and interconnected cortical circuitry related to the two levels of motor organization, i.e. simple flexion-extension movements versus movements requiring more visuomotor control, may provide more insight in both the impairment of simple movement and altered visuomotor control in PD patients. Thus, by using tasks with common general characteristics, carried out along the same joint, the present study allowed to disentangle (i) BG activations related to basic movement selection from (ii) activations related to higher order motor control implicated in visuomotor transformations. With this approach we expected to further elucidate altered organization of movement initiation/inhibition in Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics Statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen. Both healthy subjects and PD patients gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) prior to participation. All patients provided written informed consent. \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nThirteen patients with idiopathic PD experiencing mild to moderate clinical symptoms were recruited. Patients were assessed by the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)   and Hoehn and Yahr disability scale  . In addition, nineteen healthy age and gender- matched subjects were recruited for participation. Patients had to be stable and had to refrain from taking their morning dose of levodopa, or dopamine agonists (overnight withdrawal) in order to reduce medication effects. Subjects had to be right handed as assessed by the Annett Handedness Scale  . Exclusion criteria for both groups were a history of epileptic seizures, head injury, neurological diseases (for patients: other than PD), psychiatric diseases or the use of medication affecting the central nervous system. Subjects with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE  ) scores below 25 were excluded. Patients who could not abstain from their levodopa use were excluded. Additionally, patients with Parkinsonism other than PD, or the tremor-dominant type of PD were excluded from participation in the study to obtain a maximally homogeneous group of patients; tremor-dominant PD might be regarded as a PD subtype  . All subjects came for two visits on separate days with a maximum interval of two weeks. During the first visit subjects were screened neurologically (performed by CMT) and practised the task. \n\n\n### Experimental Design \n  \nAll subjects performed four different movement tasks with the right hand using a magnetic resonance (MR) compatible manipulandum, in function similar to the manipulandum described by Hoffman and Strick for their studies on step-tracking   ( ). The manipulandum consisted of a joystick-like device that enabled movements in two perpendicular planes allowing wrist flexion-extension, wrist ulnar-radial deviation and all combinations thereof. The right wrist joint was positioned in the center of the two concentric rings of the device, while the fingers were holding the grip of the manipulandum (thumb on top). The fingers were taped to the thumb in order to standardize the grip adopted by the subjects. The manipulandum was mounted on the MR table and was carefully positioned to optimally fit in the scanner and allow free movement in all directions. To provide (continuous) visual feedback on task performance, angular displacement was measured in both planes by two potentiometers (X and Y) integrated in the manipulandum. Visual feedback was provided on a screen using Spike 2 (  Cambridge Electronic Design (CED)  ,   Cambridge, UK  ) and an analog-to-digital converter board (  Power 1401, (CED)).   On this screen (display dimensions 44\u00d734 cm, screen resolution 1024\u00d7768 pixels, Barco, Belgium) both task cue (3\u00d71.5 cm open rectangles) and subject cursor (5\u00d75 mm closed square) positions were projected. Subjects saw the screen via a mirror placed 11 cm from the face. The distance between screen and mirror was 64 cm. If necessary, MR compatible lenses were provided to correct visual acuity of the subject. It was emphasized that subjects should be able to view the full screen. \n   Photograph of the wrist manipulandum.  \nThe manipulandum consists of two concentric rings moving around perpendicular axes and allowing two degrees of freedom for wrist movement: wrist flexion-extension, ulnar-radial deviation and all combinations thereof. a: (frontal view) neutral position (origin), right hand positioned in a vertical plane holding the grip of the manipulandum; b: (top view) full wrist extension and c: (side view) full radial deviation. \n  \n\n### Movement Tasks \n  \nSubjects performed the movement tasks ballistic movement initiation, stepwise interrupted movement, step-track and continuous circle movement in four runs. Each run encompassed all four movement tasks, each consisting of multiple trials within a block (overview in  ). The four blocks within a run were ordered in fixed-randomized fashion, i.e. the sequence of the four tasks varied for each of the four runs, but was the same for each subject. Blocks of different movement tasks were separated by a 35s rest (see  ). Additionally, between each run there was a short break (about 2 minutes) that could be used to communicate with the subjects and give auditory feedback when required. Prior to the start of each run, subjects had to hold their hand in a neutral position, i.e. in the center of the manipulandum, while the center of the screen was adjusted to the position of the cursor corresponding to this neutral hand position by calibration. This was done to ensure anatomic variation of hands did not interfere with task execution. After performing the tasks outside the scanner in sitting position for four runs (these data were analyzed separately  ), subjects practised the task in a dummy MRI scanner (for at least one run). Just before the scan session there was a short rehearsal of all movement tasks (one run) to ensure subjects remembered task instructions. Task performance was monitored on a computer screen in the MR control room. \n   Schematic overview of the four movement tasks.  \nA\u200a=\u200aballistic movement consisting of extension and flexion with abrupt movement onset without intentional stops (focused on movement initiation); B\u200a=\u200astepwise interrupted movement consisting of flexion-extension with four intermediate stops (focused on movement inhibition); C\u200a=\u200acentre-out step-tracking, consisting of movement towards one of eight possible directions, stopping at the target location and returning slowly; D\u200a=\u200acontinuous circle movement (wrist circumduction): consisting of following the moving target (clockwise or counter clockwise direction) as smoothly as possible (focused on gradual movement execution). \n     Example task run.        \n#### Task 1. Ballistic movement initiation (\u201cBallistic\u201d) \n  \nThis task involved abrupt initiation of hand movement  . First, subjects placed the cursor in the center of the screen (neutral position). Next, a warning cue (a cross at the center of the screen), was presented for 1 second. After disappearance of this warning cue, the initial stimulus directly appeared on the left side of the screen (at 20 degrees from the center of the screen) requiring hand movement from the neutral position towards a flexed position. This flexed position was the starting position for 4\u00d75 consecutive trials of ballistic extension \u2013 flexion movement cued by visual stimuli at the right and left side of the screen, respectively ( ). Subjects were instructed not to intentionally stop on the target but to react to the visual stimuli in an explosive manner and let flexion-extension movements be limited by the (physiological) maximum excursion of the wrist joint. After every 5 trials of extension-flexion there was a 2s break. The inter stimulus interval was 1 second. \n\n\n#### Task 2. Stepwise-interrupted movement (\u201cStepwise\u201d) \n  \nThis task was characterized by abrupt inhibition (stopping) of movement  . As for the ballistic task, after presentation of the warning cue subjects had to move their hand from the neutral to a flexed starting position in reaction to an initial flexion target. Again, the flexed position was the starting position for 4\u00d75 consecutive trials of extension-flexion movement cued by visual stimuli. After every 5 trials of extension-flexion (40 seconds) there was a 2s break. In contrast with the ballistic movement, subjects now had to make intentional stops at the extension and flexion targets and additional stops in the center, thereby interrupting the extension-flexion movement abruptly ( ). The inter stimulus interval was 1 second. \n\n\n#### Task 3. Step-tracking (\u201cStep-track\u201d) \n  \nFor the centre-out step-tracking task   subjects moved towards the target direction as fast as possible, similar to the ballistic task. The step-tracking task had eight different target directions (corresponding to the cardinal points of a compass), however. The directional component of the step-tracking task, therefore, requires more complex visuomotor integration than tasks 1 and 2. All stimuli had the same distance to the center of the screen (20 degrees). As for the ballistic and stepwise tasks, step-tracking started with the presentation of a warning cue (1 second). One second after disappearance of the warning cue, the target stimulus appeared at one of the eight positions. Subjects were required to move as fast and accurately as possible to the target from the starting position (3\u00d71.5 cm open rectangle in the center of the screen;  ). Step-tracking requires a larger variety of muscle activity as compared to tasks 1 and 2, since movement in some of the directions requires combinations of, for example, flexion and radial deviation. After moving towards the target, subjects had to hold the cursor in the target box until it disappeared (3 seconds after target appearance) before returning to the center box. Each step-track trial lasted 5 seconds. After every 10 trials of step-tracks, there was a 4s break. One step-track block consisted of 40 trials during which stimuli for the eight different directions were presented in fixed randomized order. \n\n\n#### Task 4. Continuous circle movement (\u201cCircle\u201d) \n  \nThe circle task required subjects to perform smooth wrist circumduction movements without intermediate starts and stops, requiring continuous modulation of co-active (synergistic) muscles. This was demonstrated at the behavioral level in a previous study  . During this task, subjects had to follow a circling target (at a radius of 20 degrees from the center of the screen) as smoothly and accurately as possible (i.e. subjects had to stay on target). Similar to the step-tracking task, tracking the moving cue in the circle task required directional changes of the wrist. However, in contrast with the step-tracking task, these directional changes are continuous. The starting position of the circle task was located at the lowest point of the circle ( ). First, the warning cross (in the center of the screen) disappeared; 1 second later the target started moving at constant speed (1 circle/2.9 s), either clockwise (CW) or counter clockwise (CCW). One trial of circle movements consisted of ten full rotations. Each block of the circle task consisted of five alternating trials of CW and CCW circles (CCW-CW-CCW-CW-CCW), separated by 5s breaks. \n\nDuring scanning, subject performance was visually monitored on a second computer in the MR control room. All subjects, both healthy and PD patients responded adequately to all movement cues for each task, i.e. subjects did not miss cues and performed the task according to the instructions. This was confirmed by a global check of the kinematic movement data after the fMRI experiments.   illustrates kinematic data of a typical healthy subject and of a PD patient. \n   Single subject kinematic data.  \nTypical single subject examples of kinematic data for all four movement tasks during scanning (second run of tasks).

Top: healthy subject, bottom: PD patient. \n  \n\n\n### fMRI Data Acquisition \n  \nfMRI data acquisition was performed using a 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance System (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) with a standard 6 channel head coil. T2*-weighted, 3D functional images were obtained using multislice echo planar imaging (EPI) with an echo time (TE) of 30 ms and a repetition time (TR) of 2000 ms. Per TR 39 axial slices (field of view (FOV) 224 mm, flip angle of 5\u00b0 with a 64\u00d764 matrix and isotropic voxel size of 3.5\u00d73.5\u00d73.5 mm) were acquired. Functional scanning included 370 volumes per block. Additional T1-weighted 3D anatomical scans with an axial orientation and a matrix size of 256\u00d7256 mm were obtained to provide anatomical information (isotropic voxel size 1\u00d71\u00d71 mm). \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nProcessing of images and statistical analyses were conducted with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 5 (2005, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK;  ). Pre-processing included standard slice time correction, realignment and co-registration of functional and anatomical scans. Images were normalized to the template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). \n\nWe employed a block-design based on the four different movement tasks. The onset of each block was defined by the onset of the go-signal, i.e. the first movement cue for each of the four task blocks within each run. The offset of each block was defined by the end of the last trial in each task block. We modelled the BOLD response by the canonical standard hemodynamic response function (HRF) in SPM5. In SPM5 the block design was convolved with this HRF. It is important to conceive that in this way overall differences between tasks were assessed, not restricted to a specific fraction of time within a task. Statistical parametric maps per subject (first level analysis) were derived using a linear multiple regression model that included movement parameters as regressors of no interest to account for head movement. Comparisons between the four tasks were generated at first level using custom-written scripts (Matlab, Mathworks, Natrick, MA, USA). \n\nTo confirm results from our previous study in young healthy subjects   and to ascertain that we indeed employed the appropriate movement tasks from which characteristics of movement initiation, inhibition and gradual movement modulation could logically be extracted, we initially made seven comparisons (T-contrasts) between the four conditions in healthy subjects only. To investigate activations related to movement initiation, we employed the comparison (1) \u2018Ballistic > Stepwise\u2019. Here, ballistic movement is characterized by abrupt movement initiation (or agonist activity) while stepwise movement particularly includes abrupt stopping achieved by antagonist activity on single-joint level. Although ballistic and circle movements were not balanced for visuomotor demand, (2) \u2018Ballistic > Circle\u2019 was assessed to confirm expected activations related to movement initiation. Conversely, the comparison (3) \u2018Stepwise > Ballistic\u2019 focused on activation related to movement inhibition. To investigate activations related to gradual movement modulation, we first compared activations related to the two tasks that were characterized by gradual movement adjustment (Circle and Step-track), which additionally required more visuomotor integration, with the two simple movement tasks (Ballistic and Stepwise) (4): \u2018Circle + Step-track\u2019 > \u2018Ballistic + Stepwise\u2019. As this comparison was expected to include BG activation related to both gradual movement modulation and visuomotor integration, BG activation specifically related to gradually modulated movement was disentangled from visuomotor-related activation by the comparison (5) \u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019. To obtain activations specifically related to gradual movement modulation, the comparison (6) \u2018Circle > Ballistic\u2019 was made, recognising that this comparison would include additional activations related to stronger visuomotor demand. While similar visuomotor-related activations were expected in the comparisons (6) \u2018Circle > Ballistic\u2019 and (7) \u2018Step-track > Stepwise\u2019, modulation-related activation was not expected to occur (or less strongly) in the latter. Comparisons 2, 6 and 7 demonstrated that our earlier results in young healthy subjects   were confirmed in elder healthy subjects (see Results section: Within group comparisons). We therefore used only four comparisons that were considered crucial to test our hypotheses on differences between groups. \n\nThe activation maps of the seven between-task comparisons at first level were entered in separate ANOVAs (flexible factorial design) to statistically compare results within (seven comparisons) and between groups (four out of seven comparisons), at second level. The comparisons of task-related differences between patients and healthy subjects were performed by using exclusive masking (threshold p\u200a=\u200a0.05). Note that exclusive masks remove all voxels reaching significance in one contrast that overlap with the significant voxels in the other contrast. In the analyses we focused on the BG/thalamus, premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), parietal cortex and cerebellum. To identify activations in cortical areas and the cerebellum, voxel values were thresholded at voxel response height of a liberal p\u200a=\u200a0.01 (uncorrected) with an extent threshold of k\u200a=\u200a10 voxels. For investigation of activation in the BG and thalamus we used a small volume correction since the BG cover a relatively small region within the brain. This small volume was obtained by using a spherical volume of interest (VOI) with a radius of 30 voxels and a center placed at coordinate [0, 0, 0]; only voxels located within this sphere were analyzed. For the BG and thalamus we used a liberal voxel response height of p\u200a=\u200a0.05 (uncorrected and extent threshold of k\u200a=\u200a30 voxels). The liberal thresholds were considered valid because we assessed effects in relative small brain regions for which clear hypotheses were formulated  ,  , particularly concerning movement initiation/inhibition  , while previous studies indicated that these areas are subject to PD-related changes  \u2013 . Moreover, given the fact that the general characteristics of the applied movement tasks were highly similar, the small activation differences revealed by the executed comparisons could be more specifically linked to the higher-order task components we looked for. Finally, the various comparisons made within the group of healthy subjects (seven) provided the opportunity to assess consistency in the pattern of activation increases, thus supporting the inference that, although p-values were liberal, these increases represented physiological effects and were not attributed to statistical noise. Activations in other regions were only reported when p<0.001 (uncorrected and extended voxel threshold of k\u200a=\u200a10 voxels). Brain regions were identified by rendering group activation maps onto the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) template and Brodmann template in MRICron  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subjects \n  \n19 healthy subjects and 13 patients with mild to moderate idiopathic PD participated in the study (see   for clinical details, scores are off-medication). One patient was excluded from all analyses because of using anti-Parkinson medication during the experiment. One healthy subject was excluded because of a structural anomaly in the anatomical (T1-weighted) scan. Another patient only finished three out of four blocks; these data were included in the final analysis. Thus, data from 12 patients (age range 38\u201369, mean: 58.1, SD: 8.8, male (7)) and 18 healthy subjects (age range: 50\u201369, mean: 58.7, SD: 5.4, male (9)) entered the analysis. Although some of the patients had a long disease duration, clinically, they were in relatively good condition. The clinical characteristics of the youngest patient were similar to those of the older patients and this patient was not known to have genetic mutations. A student t-test revealed that there was no significant difference between the age of healthy subjects and patients (p\u200a=\u200a1.00). MMSE scores were comparable between groups; the median MMSE-score was 28 for patients, and 29 for healthy subjects. \n   Clinical details of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.        \n\n### Within Group Comparisons: Healthy Subjects \n  \nTo better understand changed activations in PD, normal task-related activations were first identified in healthy subjects (see also Data analysis). \n\n#### Ballistic movement vs. stepwise interrupted movement \n  \nThe comparison \u2018Ballistic > Stepwise\u2019 (focused on movement initiation) was related to activations in the contralateral (left) substantia nigra (SN), caudate head, bilateral putamen and posterior thalamus. In addition, bilateral cerebellum, (pre-)motor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA) (BA 6), parietal cortex and contralateral primary sensory (S1) were more activated. Although the comparison \u2018Ballistic > Circle\u2019 was not balanced for visuomotor demand, it similarly activated the head of the left caudate and SMA, of which the latter now extended anteriorly into the pre-SMA ( ). Furthermore, \u2018Ballistic > Circle\u2019 activated the bilateral anterior thalamus, PMC, cingulate gyrus, bilateral anterior insula and ipsilateral frontal operculum. Conversely, \u2018Stepwise > Ballistic\u2019 (focused on movement inhibition), activated the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN), ipsilateral pallidum, striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). \n   Ballistic initiation versus Stepwise and Circle, respectively (healthy subjects).  \nIncreased activations (SPM-T maps) focusing on movement initiation.

These activations were located in the bilateral pallidum, posterior dorsal putamen, bilateral cerebellum, primary motor cortex (M1), S1 and ipsilateral superior parietal cortex. To investigate which area was specifically related to gradually modulated movement, and not related to differences in visuomotor demand, \u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019 was assessed. This comparison yielded activations in the contralateral pallidum and ipsilateral anterior dorsal putamen ( ). Contralateral pallidum activation was also observed in \u2018Circle > Ballistic\u2019 and not in \u2018Step-track > Stepwise\u2019, thus supporting its specific contribution to gradual movement modulation ( ). \u2018Circle > Ballistic\u2019 additionally showed increased activations in the ipsilateral posterior dorsal putamen, (anterior) cerebellum and superior medial frontal cortex, while activations in posterior cortical regions comprised ipsilateral superior parietal cortex and primary visual cortex. These additional activations reflected enhanced visuomotor control. Given the results of the above reported comparisons, activations from the comparison related to \u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019 in mid-dorsal putamen, parietal cortex and cerebellum were not unequivocally specific for gradual movement modulation but were also strongly implicated in visuomotor control ( ). \n   Gradual movement vs. visuomotor control (healthy subjects).  \nIncreased basal ganglia (BG) activations (SPM T-maps) for four different comparisons focused on dissociating the role of the BG in organization of gradual movement modulation and visuomotor control.

Decreased activation was also seen in lateral premotor areas, SMA (BA6), parietal cortex (BA7) and cerebellum. Increased activations were found in the pallidum bilaterally ( ). For \u2018Stepwise > Ballistic\u2019 (focused on movement inhibition), patients had decreased activations of bilateral STN, ipsilateral pallidum, and bilateral insula ( ), whereas activations of the contralateral putamen and ipsilateral caudate were increased. Additionally, patients showed increased activation of the cingulate gyrus and ipsilateral (pre-) motor cortex (overview in  \u2013 ). \n   Differences in task-related activations between groups.  \nSPM T-maps of changed activations for three comparisons focused on abrupt movement initiation, movement inhibition and gradual movement modulation.

Patients had increased activations in the contralateral thalamus and widely distributed in the cortex, including the sensorimotor cortex. For this comparison, patients showed decreased activations in the anterior lobulus of the cerebellum, while increases were seen in the posterior cerebellum ( ). For gradually modulated movement (\u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019), patients showed decreased activation in the pallidum bilaterally, ipsilateral in the (right) mid- and anterior dorsal putamen and (superior) parietal cortex (BA7). The decreased anterior cerebellar activation associated with visuomotor control, was not seen in \u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019 in patients. Similar to the visuomotor-associated activation increase, increased activation in \u2018Circle > Step-track\u2019 included the posterior cerebellum. Subtle activation increases were additionally seen in the contralateral anterior putamen, (anterior) thalamus, while bilateral increases in the (pre-) motor cortex were more prominently present (  and  \u2013 ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe four different movement tasks employed in the present fMRI study were all executed at single joint level (the wrist). This similarity between tasks enabled distinction of functional segregation within the BG underlying three different modes of motor action as well as enhanced visuomotor control. In PD, both decreases and increases of task-related BG and associated cortical activations were seen relative to activations in healthy subjects. Normal movement initiation was characterized by antero-ventral striatum and SN activations; movement inhibition was dominated by activation of STN and pallidum, in line with the results of our previous findings in healthy subjects  . Gradually modulated movement was related to activation of the pallidum and antero-dorsal putamen. This anterior putamen activation was located in the ipsilateral (right) hemisphere while right postero-dorsal putamen activation was associated with a stronger demand on visuomotor integration. Comparison of these healthy subject activations with the task-induced effects in patients revealed that patients had (i) reduced striato-cortical and SN activations together with increased pallidum activation for movement initiation, (ii) decreased STN activation for movement inhibition and (iii) decreased pallidum activation for both inhibition and gradually modulated movement. In contrast to the distinct cortical decreases in PD movement initiation, both cortical decreases and increases were seen when patients performed the tasks characterized by inhibition and gradual modulation. Regarding the tasks with enhanced visuomotor demand, cortical activations were increased in PD compared to healthy subjects. \n\n### Initiation, Inhibition and Gradual Movement Modulation \n  \nIn healthy subjects, abrupt movement initiation was characterized by activation of the antero-ventral striatum (caudate head) and SN, without pallidum activation, while the latter was clearly present in movement inhibition and gradual modulation. Striatal activation without a specific pallidum contribution fits the concept that initiation in ballistic movement is particularly characterized by the first agonist burst of a triphasic pattern  . The amplitude of this initial burst has been proposed to reflect a measure of the degree to which muscle force is scaled to achieve the movement prepared for  ,  . The initial stage of agonist contraction is associated with general antagonist relaxation. This may imply that for abrupt movement initiation the pallidum is not recruited for fine-tuned partial inhibition normally enabling precise movement selection  ,  \u2013 . The co-occurence of activations in the medial segment of the anterior striatum (caudate) and (pre)SMA in healthy subjects in the present study may further underscore a common contribution to movement initiation  ,  . In addition to medial frontal-striatal activations SN involvement in specifically movement initiation was previously described  . The association of caudate and SN activations with movement onset may reflect the start of a neuronal timing process  ,  . For ballistic movement, one may speculate that such timing concerns e.g. the estimated duration of agonist contraction. \n\nWhen treating activations in a small region as the STN there is a potential methodological pitfall caused by possible misregistration and smoothing. Nevertheless, activation of putative STN and pallidum during a task with repeated movement inhibition is consistent with the hypothesis that these areas play an important role in selection of appropriate movement by inhibiting unwanted movement. In other words, these areas function as a a \u2018braking\u2019 system  ,  \u2013 ,  . It should be conceived that full inhibition in our paradigm concerned stopping of ongoing movement. In contrast to the other three tasks, no increases of striatal activations were seen in this condition, suggesting a \u2018bypass\u2019 using direct cortico-STN connections  ,  ,  . Indeed, in a \u2018hyperdirect pathway\u2019, cortical information is directly transmitted via the STN to the internal pallidum and SN  . Bilateral STN activations related to inhibition might be explained by its \u2018stop-all\u2019 function  : the bilateral STN receives direct (bilateral) cortical input via the hyperdirect pathway and, during movement inhibition, inhibits the brain areas normally involved in motor tasks. In stepwise movement, inhibition implies full stops without maintained specification of selective movements. Here, activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex related to full movement inhibition, is in accordance with other studies on movement inhibition  ,  ,  ,  . From the characteristics of abrupt movement changes in the stepwise task one might infer that this task does not require an elaborate routing within the striatum for gating cortical information into direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways  ,  ,  , because such striatal gating is particularly expected in association with the modulatory role of the pallidum in movement selection based on partial inhibition  . The latter is the case in the circle task, which indeed recruited BG activations in pallidum and (dorsal) anterior striatum, without activations in either STN or SN. \n\n\n### Visuomotor Control \n  \nIn healthy subjects a functional association was found between the postero-dorsal striatum (particularly right-sided) and visuomotor integration. Ipsilateral activation is concordant with involvement of right-sided cortical areas in visual processing and spatial attention. Indeed, increased visual activations were demonstrated in the more complex visuomotor tasks ( ). Additionally, these findings are consistent with visual and parietal cortical regions generally having strong input to posterior striatum segments  \u2013 . Moreover, cortical regions that are heavily interconnected project to common targets in the striatum  ,  ,  , thereby placing the BG in a central position for facilitation and regulation of cortico-cortical interactions  ,  ,  . Depending on the BG - cortical loops involved, such interactions may, thus, be implicated in both internally-guided and visually-guided movements  . In our study, additional cerebellar involvement in the more complex visuomotor control conditions emphasizes its role in motor control by (feedforward) processing of sensorimotor information  \u2013 . The regulation character of cerebellar functions, both in feedback and feedforward modes, supports the cerebellum being particularly engaged in the performance of externally-guided movement control  ,  \u2013 . \n\n\n### Changes of Activation in PD \n  \nIn general, healthy subject activations in BG key structures related to respectively movement initiation, inhibition, gradual movement modulation and visuomotor integration were reduced in patients. Reduced activation at various task-specific locations within the striatum is consistent with the classical feature of impaired striatal function in PD. In existing models of PD, such striatal dysfunction induces disinhibition within the BG associated with a disbalance between direct and indirect pathways, resulting in an enhanced inhibitory BG outflow to successively the thalamus and cortex  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . In the present study, we indeed observed increased pallidal activations in PD during movement initiation, which is consistent with these models. However, patients also had   reduced   pallidum and STN activations during movement inhibition. Although the latter might reflect the increased vulnerability to fail at stopping ongoing movements  \u2013 , the \u2018classic\u2019 model predicts increased STN activation in PD. However, it should be kept in mind that this model describes a static condition while our findings were obtained in the dynamic circumstances of task performance. For example, direct cortical effects on the STN may strongly vary depending on the actual state of cortical activations  ,  ,  ,  . \n\nThis putative larger variation in cortical influences on BG activation in PD, compared to healthy subjects, is illustrated by the different profiles of cortical changes seen in the different tasks. In movement initiation, general cortical decreases were seen in PD, most obviously in lateral and medial premotor regions as well as various (contralateral) parietal regions. In the classic model, this is well explained by reduced BG- thalamic outflow. Moreover, these decreases were consistent with previously described cortical metabolic changes in PD resting-state conditions  \u2013 . The other tasks additionally showed cortical increases in PD relative to healthy subjects, which was particularly evident in lateral premotor and posterior parietal regions during stronger demands on visuomotor integration. Such increases might fit the enhanced responsiveness to external stimuli in PD  ,  ,  . In this respect, reduced inhibitory BG outflow to the thalamus might lead to non-specific cortical facilitation with almost reflex-like cortico-cortical interactions, which complicates performance of e.g. tasks with incongruent visual and motor parameters  ,  ,  ,  . Moreover, increased cortical activation may generate an increased excitatory load onto the BG. Elucidating the temporal dynamics in cortico-BG activations, therefore, is a challenge for future fMRI research addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD. It should be realized, in this respect, that our results concern the distribution of regional activations, detected by (changes in magnitude of) local BOLD responses. In addition to this classic method, temporal synchronization in spatially distributed BOLD fluctuations may further reveal subtle interactions within functional networks  . \n\nTo what extent posterior cerebellar activation increases in PD visuomotor control are either a direct consequence of increased cortical activation or a compensational mechanism to altered BG functioning   cannot be unequivocally concluded. These cerebellar increases during the more complex movement tasks may be due to increased reliance on visuospatial processing, which may be facilitated by reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and the BG input nuclei (as known from animal studies)  . Aside from the impact of increased complexity, a theoretical consequence of impaired movement planning would be more corrective adjustments, in which increased cerebellum activation might reflect a compensational strategy for PD-related striatal dysfunction  . \n\nA more general discussion point, applicable to all studies investigating changes in movement-related activation patterns in PD patients, is whether these changes are related to differences in task-execution or to disease-induced changes in the cerebral organization of movement. This is hard to distinguish, because changes in movement performance at the behavioral level are an integral part of the   movement   disorder. On the other hand, in the present study kinematic data demonstrated that in general tasks were performed as requested by both healthy subjects and patients ( ). Furthermore, it is well-accepted that the BG are important in movement organization and, moreover, that PD patients have specific disease-related changes in BG function. Thus, our findings of differences in activations in the BG and interconnected circuitry are likely to be related to the disease-related changes in movement organization. \n\n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn the present study we disentangled cerebral activation patterns related to various conditions of movement selection at single-joint level, varying from abrupt initiation and inhibition to gradual modulation of movement. Compared to healthy subjects, PD patients showed region-specific changes in activation during all three types of movement indicating that impaired movement organization in PD can not be attributed exclusively to increased inhibitory output of the BG. Instead, our findings appear to be better explained in the context of changed dynamic interactions between excitation and inhibition within circuitries comprising both BG and cerebral cortex. An important message of the present study is that not only decreases, but also task-dependent increases in cortical activation may occur in PD as compared to healthy subjects. Such task-specific dynamics emphasize the need to consider the effects of hyper-fluctuating cortical inputs to striatum and STN in particular. We therefore propose that, in addition to the current static model of direct and indirect BG pathways, a dynamic model would better link the expression of symptoms with altered neuronal network functioning in the Parkinsonian state. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3402450, "text_md5": "b5e2406db45ea4d557555c10b7ac4598", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 131], "journal": [132, 140], "publication_year": [142, 146], "title": [157, 276], "keywords": [290, 290], "abstract": [303, 2436], "body": [2445, 49565]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 22911738, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0041042", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402450", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3402450"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402450\">3402450</a>", "list_title": "PMC3402450  Cerebral Activations Related to Ballistic, Stepwise Interrupted and Gradually Modulated Movements in Parkinson Patients"}

Both genes are associated with lysosomal and autophagic pathways, with the   GBA1   gene encoding for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and the   LRRK2   gene encoding for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 enzyme.   GBA1  -associated PD is characterized by earlier age at onset and more severe non-motor symptoms compared to sporadic PD. Mutations in the   GBA1   gene can be stratified into severe, mild and risk variants depending on the clinical presentation of disease. Both a loss- and gain- of function hypothesis has been proposed for   GBA1   variants and the functional consequences associated with each variant is often linked to mutation severity. On the other hand,   LRRK2  -associated PD is similar to sporadic PD, but with a more benign disease course. Mutations in the   LRRK2   gene occur in several structural domains and affect phosphorylation of GTPases. Biochemical studies suggest a possible convergence of   GBA1   and   LRRK2   pathways, with double mutant carriers showing a milder phenotype compared to   GBA1  -associated PD. This review compares   GBA1   and   LRRK2  -associated PD, and highlights possible genotype-phenotype associations for   GBA1   and   LRRK2   separately, based on biochemical consequences of single variants. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the   substantia nigra pars compacta   (SNpc) and the presence of intracellular proteinaceous inclusions, named Lewy bodies which are made up primarily of alpha-synuclein protein aggregates ( ,  ). PD patients exhibit a classic triad of motor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor. A spectrum of non-motor symptoms has also been described, including cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, hyposmia and psychiatric symptoms ( ). \n\nApproximately 10\u201315% of all PD is caused by an identifiable genetic mutation ( ), with large genome wide association studies (GWAS) having identified several additional genes and genetic loci important in familial and sporadic PD, many of which are associated with lysosomal and autophagic functions. Among these are the   GBA1   gene (OMIM  ), which encodes the lysosomal hydrolase enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase; EC 3.2.1.45), and   LRRK2   (OMIM  ) which encodes the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 enzyme. Variants in these genes are widely recognized as the two most common genetic risk factors of PD worldwide ( \u2013 ). \n\nIn this review, we highlight the differences between   GBA1   and   LRRK2   variants, from both a clinical and biochemical perspective, and disentangle the complexity and heterogeneity of   GBA1  - and   LRRK2  -associated PD. We also summarize the recent findings on PD patients carrying both   GBA1   and   LRRK2   variants, and their particular clinical phenotype compared to single respective mutants, and possible pathomechanisms involved. Understanding the functional consequences of these variants and how they ultimately lead to specific PD phenotypes, is crucial to develop novel, gene-targeting therapies and direct patients to appropriate clinical trials. \n\n\n## The   GBA1   gene to protein \n  \nThe   GBA1   gene and is located on chromosome 1 (1q21) and is made up of 11 exons and 10 introns spanning a sequence of 7.6 kb. It encodes a 60 kDa lysosomal hydrolase enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The mature GCase peptide consists of 497 residues and is comprised of three non-continuous domains (as shown in  ). The active site is located in Domain III, which is a (\u03b2/\u03b1)  triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). Domain I consists of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, and Domain II resembles an immunoglobulin fold made up of 8 \u03b2-sheets ( \u2013 ). Within the mature GCase structure are three important flexible loops, which cap the active site. In an acidic environment, the conformation of loop 3 changes to allow substrates to access the active site ( ,  ). \n  \nThe X-ray structure of glucocerebrosidase (PDB code 3GXI). Domain I is shown in orange. Domain II is shown in pink. Domain III, the catalytic domain, is shown in blue and contains the active-site residues E253 and E340 which are shown as ball-and-stick models. The six significant glucocerebrosidase variants (R120W, L444P, E326K, N370S, D409H, and Rec  Ncil  ) are shown with spheres. The color of the spheres corresponds with the odds ratio associated with the variant: green (<5); yellow ( \u2013 ) and red (>9) ( ,  ). This figure was created using The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC. \n  \nGCase cleaves the sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) into glucose and ceramide at the lysosome. Bi-allelic   GBA1   mutations cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD), which presents as widespread accumulation of GlcCer and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) within the lysosomes of many cell types, particularly macrophages, across several tissues and organs. GCase is folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and binds to the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) to be trafficked to the lysosome, through the secretory pathway where it undergoes   N  -linked glycosylation ( \u2013 ). These post-translational modifications are thought to be imperative to the production of a fully active enzyme ( ). \n\n\n## Common   GBA1   variants \n  \nAlmost 300 unique variants have been reported in the   GBA1   gene, which span the entire protein ( ). These include missense or non-sense mutations, insertions or deletions, complex alleles and splice junction mutations. The point mutations c.1226A>G (N370S) and c.1448T>C (L444P) are the most commonly associated with GD ( ,  ). Generally the L444P variant causes a severe, neuronopathic type II or III GD, whereas the N370S variant is generally associated with non-neuronopathic type I GD ( ). Some   GBA1   mutations arise from recombination events between the functional   GBA1   gene and a highly homologous pseudogene (  GBA1  P), an example of which is the complex allele Rec  Ncil   ( ,  ). \n\nMany mutations in the   GBA1   gene, including the common R120W variant, occur in and around the active site, influencing its stability and affecting enzyme activity. Other common mutations including, D409H and L444P, occur far from the active site, suggesting important roles for Domains I and II ( ). In the case of the L444P variant, the substitution of leucine to proline causes rigidity in the protein backbone, potentially disrupting the hydrophobicity of the domain ( ) which may influence protein folding. This variant is also thought to be influenced by a lack of N-linked glycosylation and subsequent structural instability ( ). To date, the crystal structure of N370S   GBA1   is the only X-ray structure resolved. The N370S mutation occurs at the interface of domains II and III ( ) and prevents stabilization of loop 3 at an acidic pH, impairing the ability of GCase to bind its substrate ( ,  ). \n\n\n##  GBA1   variants and Parkinson disease \n  \nBiallelic or monoallelic variants in the   GBA1   gene are found in 10-15% of PD cases worldwide, and up to 30% of cases of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry ( ). The penetrance of   GBA1   variants in PD is variable. The probability of developing PD is ~5\u20137 and 9\u201312% among GD patients and 1.5\u201314 and 8\u201319% among   GBA1   heterozygous carriers, by age 60 and 80, respectively ( ,  \u2013 ). \n\nWithin PD,   GBA1   gene variants are stratified into complex, severe, mild and risk variants. The severity of a   GBA1   mutation is based upon the phenotype it presents when homozygous in those with GD. Risk variants are referred to as such as they do not present any clinical features of GD when homozygous or compound heterozygous, but increase the risk of PD ( \u2013 ). \n\nThe type of variant differently influences the risk of PD, with higher odd ratios (OR) for complex or severe variants (e.g., L444P), followed by mild (e.g., N370S) and risk (e.g., E326K) variants (OR: 15, 4, and 2, respectively) ( ,  ,  ,  ), as highlighted in  . \n\n\n##  GBA1-  Parkinson disease: Clinical picture and genotype-phenotype associations \n  \nFrom a pathological point of view,   GBA1   associated PD (  GBA1  -PD) cases present with diffuse Lewy body pathology ( \u2013 ). From a clinical perspective, the most striking differences between   GBA1  -PD and sporadic PD cases are an earlier presentation and more severe non-motor phenotype, mainly within the cognitive, psychiatric, and olfactory domains ( ,  \u2013 ). However, this more severe phenotype is more clearly recognizable in patients carrying complex or severe variants, supporting a genotype-phenotype association ( ,  ). \n\nIn terms of cognitive function,   GBA1  -PD patients with mild or risk variants showed slower occurrence of cognitive impairment compared to complex or severe variants ( ,  ,  ), or to non-carriers ( ). Psychiatric symptoms, hallucinations and hyposmia are also more common in   GBA1  -PD vs. non-carriers ( ,  ,  ,  ), and these are more frequent in carriers of severe and complex variants compared to mild or risk variants ( ,  ). \n\nControversy surrounds disease progression in   GBA1  -PD. In one study,   GBA1  -PD was characterized by a more aggressive progression and reduced survival rates compared to non-carriers ( ), however, in another longitudinal study evaluating AJ patients, no significant effect on survival of either severe or mild variants was detected ( ). When stratifying by variant type, risk variants were associated with similar mortality rates compared to non-carriers ( ), with the greatest association with increased mortality in patients carrying severe variants ( ). \n\nSevere variants are generally associated with faster development of motor complications ( ,  ). However, more recent longitudinal studies suggest that   GBA1   status does not influence the risk of developing motor complications, even where different types of variants were considered separately ( \u2013 ). \n\nEvaluating the biochemical consequences of   GBA1   variants and their relationship with clinical features may aid in understanding of the complexity of   GBA1  -PD. Among markers of   GBA1   dysfunction, GCase enzymatic activity is the most studied. GCase activity was found to be reduced in leucocytes ( ), dried blood spots ( \u2013 ), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ( ) of patients with   GBA1  -PD compared to non-carriers. GCase activity presented a steeper decline among   GBA1  -PD patients according to variant severity ( ). In a longitudinal analysis, increasing severity of   GBA1   variants was associated with increasingly steeper decline in GCase activity, however the latter was not correlated overall with increasing severity of motor or cognitive features ( ). Similarly, no genotype-phenotype correlation was found between GCase enzymatic activity and disease severity outcomes in a cross-sectional study ( ), suggesting that GCase enzymatic activity might not be a reliable marker of disease severity or progression in   GBA1  -PD. Longitudinal studies evaluating other biochemical consequences of   GBA1   dysfunction (e.g., sphingolipid metabolism), maybe in combination with GCase deficiency, and their ultimate impact on disease course, are needed. \n\n\n##  GBA1   variants and Parkinson disease: Pathogenic mechanisms \n  \nBoth loss- and gain- of function pathways are proposed to influence PD risk and onset ( ,  ), and it is thought that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. An overview of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with individual   GBA1   mutations can be found in  . \n  \nOverview of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with the most common   GBA1   variants associated with PD (L444P, N370S, and E326K). \n  \n(\u2193) denotes reduction in function, (\u2191) denotes an increase and (\u2013) denotes unchanged or no literature surrounding this mechanism. \n\nALP, autophagy lysosomal pathway; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. \n  \nVariants in the   GBA1   gene often lead to a loss of GCase function. Analysis of GCase activity in the blood of PD patients has demonstrated that patients with severe   GBA1   mutations exhibit a greater reduction in GCase activity when compared to those with mild   GBA1   mutations and risk variants ( ). This is supported by functional analysis of recombinant GCase protein, showing that risk variants reduce GCase activity to a lesser extent than GD-causing variants. The L444P and N370S variants reduce catalytic activity by 75\u201397 and 65\u201397%, respectively, whereas the E326K variant was associated with a 43\u201358% reduction ( ,  \u2013 ). The same pattern has been observed in fibroblast lines from patients harboring these mutations ( ). However, this genotype-phenotype correlation is absent in one study in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopamine neurons where GCase activity was similarly reduced in L444P and N370S variants ( ). \n\nA loss of GCase activity may explain some of the downstream pathogenic mechanisms observed in models of   GBA1   variants, as in human cells a GCase deficiency was associated with lysosomal dysfunction and alpha-synuclein pathology ( ). In iPSC-derived midbrain dopamine neurons, the N370S variant has been associated with a significant reduction in GCase activity and protein, accompanied by impairment of the lysosome, altered distribution of GlcCer and increased extracellular release of alpha-synuclein ( ). Similarly, in neural crest stem cell-derived midbrain dopamine neurons, heterozygous N370S mutations cause a loss of GCase function, impaired macroautophagy and alpha-synuclein pathology. This was rescued by the small molecular chaperone, ambroxol, suggesting these arose due to improper trafficking and activity of N370S GCase protein ( ). \n\nIn cells harboring the L444P mutation, impaired lysosomal and autophagic function has been demonstrated, accompanied by a significant reduction in GCase activity and protein ( \u2013 ). However, contrary to the hypothesis that a loss of GCase function is imperative for cellular pathology, in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons from patients with homozygous and heterozygous L444P and N370S mutations, activity did not correlate with pathology. In homozygous lines, GCase activity was reduced to a greater extent than heterozygous lines, however no difference was observed in alpha-synuclein pathology and autophagic defects ( ). \n\nImproper function of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) can lead to the aberrant metabolism of alpha-synuclein. Such has been shown in models of L444P and N370S variants ( ,  ). In L444P heterozygous mice, a significant loss of GCase activity led to an abundance of alpha-synuclein inclusions in the brain and altered levels of GlcSph ( ). This variant has also been associated with increased neuronal vulnerability to and accelerated spread of alpha-synuclein pathology in mice ( ,  ). \n\nIt has also been proposed that there may be a genotype-phenotype correlation between severe and mild   GBA1   variants and alpha-synuclein pathology. In SH-SY5Y cells, the L444P variant was associated with a greater increase in alpha-synuclein accumulation and stabilization, compared to N370S and wild-type ( ). Another study in fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated that both L444P and N370S fibroblasts exhibited an increase in the release of extracellular vesicles compared to control lines. However, alpha-synuclein pathology in SH-SY5Y cells was only promoted when incubated with vesicles isolated from L444P lines, and not N370S lines ( ). In addition, a recent study showed that the E326K and L444P variants, despite different GCase activity, both presented comparable levels of alpha-synuclein aggregates suggesting that loss of GCase activity is not the only mechanism involved in alpha-synuclein pathology and that other mechanisms are involved in this process, especially for risk variants ( ). \n\nIn addition to alpha-synuclein, the metabolism of lipids can be affected by impairment of the ALP or mitochondria, the latter of which has also been demonstrated in models of L444P ( ,  ) and N370S ( ) variants. Changes in the composition of glycosphingolipids has been demonstrated in models of   GBA1   variants, likely due to a loss of GCase function and poor lysosomal and autophagic degradation. In mice with N370S and L444P variants, a reduction in GCase function was concurrent with an accumulation of GlcSph, which promoted alpha-synuclein aggregation ( ). Similarly, in N370S iPSC-derived dopamine neurons an accumulation of GlcCer and alpha-synuclein was observed ( ). \n\nAccumulation of glycosphingolipids may be key to the pathology of L444P and N370S   GBA1   variants as in dopamine neurons with these variants, reducing the levels of GlcCer/GlcSph rescued alpha-synuclein pathology ( ,  ). Interestingly, in one study of L444P mice an accumulation of GlcSph alone was observed, which accelerated alpha-synuclein aggregation ( ). In fibroblasts from L444P heterozygous patients, a significant increase in glycosphingolipids has been demonstrated, which correlated with decreased GCase activity. When these lipids were extracted and incubated with recombinant alpha-synuclein, an increase in the pathogenic aggregation of alpha-synuclein was observed, due to a higher content of short-chain lipids in the L444P cells ( ). This may occur as lipid membrane dynamics are required for macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) ( ). \n\nIn addition to glycosphingolipids, the level of fatty acids may be altered by   GBA1   variants. In SH-SY5Y cells, expression of the E326K variant led to increased accumulation and formation of lipid droplets, which was accompanied by alpha-synuclein aggregation ( ), suggesting alterations in the metabolism of several lipid types may be key to   GBA1   pathology. \n\nAn additional pathogenic mechanism that has been proposed for   GBA1  -associated PD arises from the toxic gain-of-function hypothesis. As the majority of   GBA1   variants are missense, a misfolded protein is often produced and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This can activate ERAD, and lead to a deficiency in enzyme level through degradation and can activate pathway such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) and eventual ER stress. In some studies, in fibroblasts and Drosophila, activation of the UPR has been demonstrated in L444P and N370S variants ( ,  ). Conversely, other studies have suggested a genotype-phenotype correlation between variant severity of UPR activation. In fibroblasts and SH-SY5Y cells, L444P has been associated with ER retention and ER stress, which was absent in N370S and E326K cells ( ,  ). In another study, the severe L444P variant displayed extensive ERAD ( ), suggesting that the extent of ER stress may correlate with disease severity, perhaps due to more pronounced conformational changes. However, another fibroblast study has demonstrated heterogeneity in ER retention and degradation across lines with the N370S genotype ( ), weakening the genotype-phenotype correlation argument. \n\nOverall, current evidence suggests that the mechanisms in which   GBA1   variants predispose to PD are multifaceted. Different pathogenic mechanisms could explain the differences in risk and phenotypes of PD for single variants, and future studies will need to address these questions. The reasons why the majority of GD patients or heterozygous carriers do not develop PD, also remain unexplained. \n\n\n##  GBA1-  Parkinson disease: Current and future therapeutic strategies \n  \nThe discovery of the   GBA1   gene in PD has opened a new avenue to develop novel therapeutics for PD, with several   GBA1  -targeted strategies under development with the aim to enhance GCase activity [reviewed in smith et al. ( )]. \n\nSignificant focus is on the development of molecular chaperones to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) to bind and refold GCase in the ER, facilitating trafficking and rescuing enzyme activity ( ). Within this class is the inhibitory, pH-dependant small molecular chaperone, ambroxol ( ), which has been shown to increase GCase activity and reduce alpha-synuclein pathology in several cell and animal models ( ,  \u2013 ). Ambroxol has also demonstrated the ability to reduce UPR activation in   Drosophila   models of GCase deficiency ( ,  ). In Type 1 GD patients, ambroxol has been shown to be safe and tolerable (  Identifier: NCT03950050) ( ) and results from a phase II, single-centre trial, in PD patients with and without   GBA1   mutations, demonstrate that ambroxol can cross the BBB and enter the CSF where it can alter GCase activity and protein level (  Identifier: NCT02941822) ( ). Ambroxol also increased the alpha-synuclein concentration in the CSF and, importantly, improved motor function. A phase III clinical trial of ambroxol in treating PD is expected to commence in early 2023. \n\nIn addition to inhibitory chaperones, development of non-inhibitory chaperones for GCase is underway. Two compounds, NCGC758 and NCGC607, have been shown to improve GCase trafficking and rescue glycosphingolipid and alpha-synuclein accumulation in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons from   GBA1  -PD patients ( ,  ). \n\nAllosteric modulator small molecules, that can bind and enhance GCase activity, are also an area of interest. An example of which is LT1-291, which has been shown to cross the BBB (Trialregister.nl ID: NTR7299) ( ). Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that LT1-291 can reduce substrate accumulation ( ), and this was also shown in a phase 1b placebo-controlled trial in   GBA1  -PD patients (NL6574). Further clinical trials are expected. \n\nSmall molecules are also being developed to modulate GCase activity through targeting other proteins. An example of this are histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which have been shown to increase GCase activity by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation ( ,  ) or improving GCase folding and trafficking ( ) in GD fibroblasts. \n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has shown great efficacy in improving the visceral symptoms of GD but fails to cross the BBB ( ). Currently research is underway to improve the delivery of wild-type GCase enzyme and enhance its ability to cross the BBB. This involves ligating a peptide, usually a virus-associated protein, to the GCase enzyme ( ). Denali Therapeutics have recently developed the transport-vehicle-modified recombinant GCase enzyme (ETV:  GBA1  ) compound, using their transport vehicle platform technology which has the potential to actively transport enzymes across the BBB ( ). Preclinical research is underway with this compound, but further studies are needed to investigate its efficacy in   GBA1  -PD patients. \n\nAnother avenue being explored to deliver wild-type GCase enzyme to the brain is gene therapy. Most commonly, the   GBA1   gene is ligated into the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, and delivered to the brain. In mouse models of GD this method has been shown to rescue GCase activity and expression, reduce alpha-synuclein pathology and decrease glycosphingolipid accumulation ( \u2013 ). Prevail Therapeutics are currently testing their PR001A compound, which delivers the   GBA1   gene using the AAV-9 vector, in phase I clinical trials (  Identifier: NCT04127578 and NCT04411654). \n\nStrategies targeted to GCase to reduce the accumulation of glycosphingolipid substrates are also under development. Substrate reduction therapy (SRT), miglustat, has shown efficacy in reducing lipid accumulation in dopamine neurons from PD patients with   GBA1   mutations, and can reduce alpha-synuclein pathology when coupled with GCase over-expression ( ). However, miglustat cannot cross the BBB. Novel brain penetrant SRTs are therefore being developed. Sanofi's venglustat (GZ667161) had shown promise in GCase-deficient synucleinopathy mice models, able to reduce alpha-synuclein and glycosphingolipid accumulation and improve cognitive function ( ). The phase I trials of venglustat demonstrated successful target engagement (  Identifier: NCT01674036 and NCT01710826), however the phase II trial failed to show a benefit, with patients with   GBA1   mutations exhibiting a decline in motor function in PD (  Identifier: NCT02906020). \n\n\n## The   LRRK2   gene to protein \n  \nThe   LRRK2   gene (also known as   PARK8  ), first discovered in 2002 encodes for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (  LRRK2  , OMIM  ) ( ). It is located on chromosome 12, consists of 51 exons and encodes a large, 288 kDa multi-domain protein containing seven domains (as illustrated in  ): armadillo repeat motif (ARM); ankyrin repeat (ANK); leucine-rich repeat (LRR); Ras of complex (ROC) GTPase domain; C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain; kinase (KIN) domain; WD40 domain ( ).   LRRK2   is thought to dimerize   via   the ROC-COR and WD40 domains, while the WD40 domain has also been implicated in   LRRK2  -mediated neurotoxicity ( \u2013 ). \n  \nStructure of the   LRRK2   protein and residing pathogenic variants.   (A)   Structural ribbon model of the   LRRK2   monomer. PDB: 7LHW. This figure was created using The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.   (B)   Full-length   LRRK2   protein. Created with  . \n  \n LRRK2   is expressed ubiquitously in the brain, including neurons and glial cells, as well as in the kidneys, lungs, liver, heart and immune cells ( \u2013 ). The   LRRK2   protein is thought to be primarily cytosolic but can also localize to a subset of organelles and inner cellular membranes, including mitochondria, ER, Golgi apparatus and microtubules ( ,  ). However, the physiological roles of   LRRK2   remain unclear, although it is suggested to be involved in many different processes such as adult neurogenesis, scaffolding, homeostasis of lysosome-related organelles, the innate immune response and neuroinflammation ( \u2013 ). \n\n\n## Common   LRRK2   variants \n  \nThere are several LRRK2 missense variants that have been confirmed to increase PD risk, including the most common variant G2019S, as well as N1437H, R1441C/G/H/S, Y1699C and I2020T ( ,  ). \n\nAs seen in  , G2019S resides in the activation loop of   LRRK2  's ATP binding site which regulates   LRRK2   kinase activity ( ). A computational prediction study suggests that G2019S may decrease the flexibility of the loop and improves the stability of the kinase domain, enabling it to remain in an active conformation for an extended period ( ). This has been shown to increase phosphorylation of substrates by 2- to 3-fold ( ). Another variant associated with increased PD risk, I2020T, is also located in the activation loop of the kinase domain and has been reported to significantly increase   LRRK2   autophosphorylation by around 40% relative to the native enzyme ( ). \n\nOther variants that do not reside in the kinase domain may also modify   LRRK2   kinase activity. The ROC domain contains motifs that are conserved amongst GTP-binding proteins, suggesting that   LRRK2   is a functioning GTPase that can regulate   LRRK2   kinase activity ( \u2013 ). An   in vitro   study showed that the R144C/G/H/S mutations located in the ROC domain, increases kinase activity while decreasing GTP hydrolysis and weakening LRRK2 dimerisation ( ). N1437H in the ROC domain has been proposed to impair monomer-dimer conformational dynamics and hinder GTPase activity, permanently locking LRRK2 into a dimeric state ( ). T1410M, found in the ROC domain, is a novel variant with unclear pathogenicity and may distort the tertiary structure of LRRK2 and disrupt GTP hydrolysis ( ). Meanwhile, the Y1699C variant resides in the COR domain and is proposed to strengthen ROC-COR interactions, weaken ROC-COR dimerization and reduce GTPase activity ( ). \n\nY2189C, identified in Arab-Berber populations ( ), is located within the WD40 domain is presumed to have a deleterious effect for   LRRK2   and induces high levels of cellular toxicity ( ), however there is still controversy surrounding its pathogenicity for PD ( ,  ). The G2385R and R1628P variants act as potential genetic risk factors in Chinese and Malaysian populations ( \u2013 ). G2385R is also located within the WD40 domain and causes dysfunctional synaptic vesicle trafficking ( ,  ,  ), while R1628P is located in the COR domain. \n\n\n##  LRRK2   gene variants and Parkinson disease \n  \nWorldwide, the frequency of   LRRK2   G2019S is found in 1% of sporadic PD and 4% of familial PD cases ( ). It is most frequently found in sporadic PD cases of north African Arabs and of AJ descent (30 and 10% of cases, respectively), whereas the variant is rarely found in Asians (only 0.1%) ( ). \n\nThe penetrance of PD in subjects carrying a   LRRK2   mutation is not fully elucidated and varies with age, which may explain both the high prevalence of mutations in sporadic PD cases and the detection of mutations in unaffected individuals ( ). Although this finding has been repeatedly reported, the precise mutation penetrance rates vary across studies due to different populations considered and methodologies applied, and it is unclear whether distinct variants can differently impact on penetrance. Overall, cumulative risk has been estimated to be around 30\u201340% at age 80, with variable figures ranging from 7 and 80% ( \u2013 ). In one study considering effects of pathogenic   LRRK2   mutations on penetrance, carriers of G2019S showed a lower penetrance compared to carriers of other pathogenic mutations combined, although the group of non-G2019S was relatively small ( ). \n\n\n##  LRRK2  -Parkinson disease: Clinical picture and genotype-phenotype associations \n  \n LRRK2  -PD patients are clinically very similar to sporadic PD. There are no differences in age at onset between   LRRK2  -PD patients carrying pathogenic variants vs. non-carriers ( ,  ), as well as between carriers of different pathogenic mutations (G2019S vs. R1441C/G/H) ( ), or carriers of risk variants vs. non-carriers ( ) or vs. carriers of pathogenic variants ( ). Interestingly, the male predominance seen in PD is less represented within   LRRK2  -PD patients ( ,  ). \n\nThe motor phenotype of   LRRK2  -PD is that of levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, with sustained response over time, later onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia ( ,  ), and milder progression in motor symptoms over time ( ) compared to non-carriers. \n\nAlthough data comparing different genotypes is limited, there may be genotype-phenotype associations within   LRRK2  -PD, with risk variants showing a more rapid progression and G2019S a more benign course. Higher incidence of postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) sub-type has been reported in PD patients of both AJ origin carrying G2019S ( ,  ,  ), and Chinese origin carrying G2385R ( ), when compared to non-carriers. Similar rates of PIGD sub-type were found in G2019S and G2385R when compared together ( ). Within pathogenic variants, PD patients with G2019S showed more frequent PIGD when compared to patients carrying the R1441G variant ( ). When analyzing disease course, carriers of pathogenic variants showed more sustained response to levodopa and lower motor scores when compared to carriers of risk variants ( ,  ), and survival curves of AJ G2019S PD carriers were also not different from those of non-carriers ( ,  ). Within pathogenic mutations, motor fluctuations were more frequently reported in carriers of p.R1441C/G/H mutation than in carriers of p.G2019S mutation ( ). \n\nFrom a non-motor perspective, the phenotype of all   LRRK2  -PD patients seems to be more benign compared to that of non-carriers. Slower cognitive decline has been observed in   LRRK2  -PD compared to sporadic PD or   GBA1  -PD ( ,  ). Carriers of G2019S PD patients also showed better olfactory function, less severe mood disorders, and less frequent REM sleep behavior disorders (RBD) ( ,  ) compared to non-carriers ( ). In a cohort of Chinese patients, carriers of G2385R presented better cognitive performances and more severe RBD symptoms compared to non-carriers ( ). \n\nOverall, a genotype-phenotype relationship among   LRRK2  -PD patients might exist, with pathogenic variants showing a more benign motor disease course compared to risk variants. These observed clinical differences could reflect a lower pathogenicity for p.G2019S mutation, however additional genetic and environmental factors beyond mutational status might contribute to these different manifestations. \n\n\n##  LRRK2   gene variants and Parkinson disease: Pathogenic mechanisms \n  \nAs a major player in the ALP, pathogenic   LRRK2   mutations have been shown to alter lysosomal activity, including late stage endocytosis, lysosome trafficking and synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( ). In primary mouse astrocytes, G2019S, R1441C, and Y1699C reduce lysosomal capacity and increase lysosome size, and G2019S also reduces lysosomal pH, which is associated with dysfunctional lysosomal activity ( ). Some reports also suggest a gain-of-function mechanism for G2019S involving ER stress and UPR, although the precise mechanisms and how they may underlie PD are poorly understood ( \u2013 ). \n\nG2019S heterozygous and homozygous mice are reported to exhibit impaired extracellular release of dopamine and profound abnormalities of mitochondria in the striatum ( ). More recent studies show that G2019S knock-in mice exhibit increased dopamine transporter levels, dopamine uptake and phosphorylation of \u03b1-synuclein from 9 months of age, while   LRRK2  -KO mice show slight elevation of total \u03b1-synuclein immunoreactivity at 23 months of age ( ,  ). In addition, G2019S also alter glutaminergic synaptic transmission in midbrain dopaminergic neurons of 10\u201312 month old (middle-aged) mice which reflects aging before the onset of motor symptoms in PD ( ). In astrocyte-dopaminergic neuron co-cultures from G2019S   LRRK2  -carrying PD patients, astrocytes accumulate \u03b1-synuclein and the neurons display shortened neurites and neurodegeneration which are not seen in co-cultures with control-patient-derived astrocytes ( ). Collectively, this suggests that gain-of-function   LRRK2   variants may increase the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to degeneration and implicates   LRRK2   in \u03b1-synuclein clearance and homeostasis in PD pathology. \n\nAlthough most studies focus on gain-of-function   LRRK2   variants, large-scale genetic sequencing suggests that loss-of-function variants can also reduce   LRRK2   protein levels in around 82% of heterozygous carriers. However, loss-of-function variants may not be strongly associated with a specific PD phenotype ( ). This not only further emphasizes the link between increased kinase activity and familial PD, but also highlights the importance of additional research to elucidate both the physiological functions of   LRRK2   as well as the precise mechanisms in which   LRRK2   variants influence PD risk, onset and progression. \n\n\n## Rab proteins linked to   LRRK2   in Parkinson disease \n  \n LRRK2   kinase has been shown to phosphorylate a subset of GTPases, called Rab GTPases ( ). Rab proteins play important roles in vesicle trafficking, regulating the formation, transport, tethering and fusion of vesicles specific to each specific Rab, and dysfunction in Rab-mediated vesicle trafficking has been implicated in PD pathology ( ). Although G2019S has been shown to increase phosphorylation of Rab proteins,   in vivo   assays show that other mutations such as R1441G also enhance Rab phosphorylation by up to 20-fold ( ,  ). However, dysfunctional mutant T1348N   LRRK2   demonstrates reduced kinase activity, suggesting the importance of GTP-binding in downstream signaling events ( ). \n\nRAB29, also known as RAB7L1, is contained within the PD-linked PARK16 locus ( ,  ). RAB29 is thought to be the master regulator of   LRRK2  , recruiting   LRRK2   to the   trans-  Golgi network and stimulating kinase activity. The R1441G/C and Y1699C pathogenic variants have been shown to enhance this recruitment ( ), and GTP-binding is thought to be crucial for RAB29-mediated activation of   LRRK2  . This then triggers downstream phosphorylation of various Rab proteins, such as RAB8A/B and RAB10 ( ,  ). \n\nRAB8A/B and RAB10 have been shown to be involved in primary ciliogenesis, although direct links between   LRRK2   and ciliogenesis in PD have yet to be established ( ). RAB29, RAB8A, and RAB10 are all implicated in maintaining lysosome homeostasis, and Liu et al. reported that phosphorylated RAB10 may also play a role in phagocytic immune response ( ), further supporting any links between   LRRK2   and lysosomal dysfunction in PD ( ). \n\n\n##  LRRK2   gene variants and Parkinson disease: Current and future therapeutic strategies \n  \nThere have been many recent developments in LRRK2-targeted strategies in PD, with a strong focus on small molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors which has been shown to trigger neuroprotective effects ( ,  ). \n\nThe majority of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are ATP-competitive, where the molecules compete with ATP for binding to the ATP-binding pocket in the kinase domain ( ,  ). MLi-2 is a compound that exhibits exceptional potency and specificity both   in vitro   and in mouse models, where it has been shown to be well-tolerated with no adverse effects on body weight, food intake or behavior ( ,  ). Although MLi-2 failed to slow or halt the progression of PD in mice and never reached clinical trials, it is an important compound for researchers to study LRRK2 function and pathobiology. PF-06685360, or PFE-360, also shows high potency, kinase selectivity and good brain permeability in rats ( ). Two inhibitors [DNL-201 and DNL-151 (NCT03710707 and NCT04056689, respectively,  )] are already in clinical trials ( ,  ). \n\nHowever, there are several challenges facing therapies targeting LRRK2 kinase. As LRRK2 protein expression is not limited to only the brain, it is crucial to assess any adverse effects on other systems in the body, such as in kidneys, lungs and immune cells. Preclinical toxicology studies show possible kidney and lung pathology as a results of various LRRK2 inhibitors ( ,  ,  ,  ), and both activation and inhibition of LRRK2 kinase in immune cells have been associated with immune function ( ). \n\nAnother challenge is the current lack of biomarkers and scalable assays that can measure LRRK2 activity in patients. To date, the most promising candidate biomarker is phosphorylated Rab protein ( ,  ), as well as levels of auto-phosphorylated LRRK2 at Ser1292 ( ). For example, phosphorylated RAB10 has been shown to be significantly increased in the brain of idiopathic PD patients ( ). The development of reliable biomarkers is critical for early PD diagnosis ( ), patient selection for the enrolment to clinical trials, to identify patients in which LRRK2 inhibition may be most effective and allow for personalized dose adjustments ( ). \n\nFinally, although increased LRRK2 kinase activity is present in other forms of genetic PD and especially sporadic PD ( ), further research must be conducted to assess LRRK2 activity and function in these forms of PD order to assess the viability of LRRK2 inhibitors to treat all types of PD. \n\n\n##  GBA1   and   LRRK2   interactions \n  \nAlthough there are many clear differences between   GBA1-   and   LRRK2  - associated PD, highlighted in  , there is increasing evidence suggesting a possible interaction between   GBA1   and   LRRK2   in PD ( ). Clinical studies show that individuals carrying both the G2019S   LRRK2   variant and a   GBA1   variant exhibit symptoms that closely mimic G2019S-  LRRK2   PD symptoms and are milder than patients carrying only a   GBA1   variant. This includes slower rates of cognitive and motor decline and milder olfactory dysfunction ( ). Compound variant carriers may have higher risk of developing PD, coupled with a tendency for a slightly earlier age at onset, compared with patients carrying just one variant and sporadic PD patients ( ,  \u2013 ). This suggests that the G2019S   LRRK2   variant might be dominant over pathogenic   GBA1   variants, although it could also depend on the varying penetrance of the two genes. In addition, it is also possible that the   GBA1  /  LRRK2  -PD patients in the study are exhibiting   LRRK2  -mediated PD and the   GBA1   variants act as a bystander in pathology progression. \n  \nOverview of the clinical presentation and pathological differences between   GBA1  - and LRRK2- associated PD. \n  \n(sPD) denotes sporadic PD; (\u2013) denotes no change. \n\nALP, autophagy lysosomal pathway; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. \n  \nBiochemical studies appear to support a link between   LRRK2   kinase activity and GCase activity. For example, G2019S and R1441G/C variants reduce GCase activity (but not GCase protein levels) in dopaminergic neurons through increased RAB10 phosphorylation ( ,  ). However, G2019S and the gain-of-function   LRRK2   variant M1646T [association with PD risk is unclear ( ,  )] are reported to increase GCase activity in dried blood spots ( ,  ). Therefore, the influence of   LRRK2   variants on GCase activity appears to be inconsistent between the blood and dopaminergic neurons. However, there are currently a lack of studies focussing on GCase activity on   LRRK2   which warrants further investigation. In addition, progression and onset are very difficult to study in cell models and compound mutant carriers are extremely rare, posing further difficulties in investigating the convergence of the two pathways. \n\n\n## Concluding remarks \n  \nThe discovery of the   GBA1   and   LRRK2   mutations as the most important genetic risk factors for developing PD has led to enhanced understanding of the underlying causes of PD. Understanding the functional consequences associated with individual variants is imperative to develop highly efficacious gene-targeted therapies to halt or restore neurodegeneration. Further evaluation of   GBA1   and   LRRK2   variants and clinical presentation, as well as investigations into interactions between the two genes, is needed to develop biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention and treatment of PD. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLJS, C-YL, EM, and AHVS contributed to drafting and editing the manuscript and have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThis research was funded in part by Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (Grant number: ASAP-000420) through the Michael J.

Manual fractional anisotropy measurements were performed for the ventral, intermediate, and dorsal portions of the substantia nigra, as well as for the cerebral peduncles, putamen, thalamus, and supplementary motor area. The correlation analysis between these measurements and the clinical variables was performed using   \u03c7   variance and multiple linear regression. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared to healthy controls, Parkinson disease patients had significantly reduced fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra (  P  \u2009<\u2009.05). Some fractional anisotropy measurements in the substantia nigra correlated inversely with duration of Parkinson disease and Parkinson disease severity scores. Reduced fractional anisotropy values in the substantia nigra were also correlated inversely with age variable. fractional anisotropy values obtained for the right and left putamen varied significantly between males and females in both groups. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nManual fractional anisotropy measurements in the substantia nigra were confirmed to be feasible with a 1.5-T scanner. Diffusion tensor imaging data can be used as a reliable biomarker of Parkinson disease that can be used to support diagnosis, prognosis, and progression/treatment monitoring. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra (SN) and \u03b1-synuclein aggregate accumulation in the brain stem, spinal cord, and cortex.  Although PD diagnosis is based primarily on clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide important information for differential diagnosis, including ruling out atypical parkinsonism and structural lesions. \n\nThe development of advanced MRI techniques, including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional MRI, has augmented the utility of MRI in the early diagnosis of PD.  These advanced techniques yield measurements that can be correlated with disease severity scales, making them potentially useful for staging and management.  In recent years, DTI has emerged as a promising tool for identifying and quantitating localized microstructural changes in sites where conventional MRI does not reveal significant alterations. Additionally, DTI provides a unique window into assessing changes in neuronal connectivity and allows quantitative measurements of the integrity of brain nuclei and white matter tracts. \n\nWater diffusibility reductions in the SN of patients with PD have been reported to correlate inversely with disease severity, with mild reductions being evident even in early-stage PD.  In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Cochrane et\u00a0al.  found significant fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions in patients with PD. Conversely, in their meta-analysis, Schwarz et\u00a0al.  did not find a consistent reduction in FA within the SN. This inconsistency was attributed to variability among the studies, including inter-study differences in cohort characteristics, scanner magnetic fields, and DTI sequence parameters. \n\nAlthough changes in diffusibility have also been observed in the striatum, thalamus, olfactory bulbs, frontal lobes, and cerebellar hemispheres of patients with PD,  relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses have generated conflicting results.  Consequently, clinicians do not yet have reliable DTI markers of PD, particularly for identifying early-stage PD and assessing PD progression. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that it is feasible to establish PD biomarkers with manual FA measurements within specified brain regions using scanners that are ubiquitously available. \n\n\n## Material and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nWe enrolled 42 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD based on the UK PD Society Brain Bank\u2019s diagnostic criteria  as well as 20 healthy controls (HCs) with no MRI abnormalities and no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The patients were seen at the ambulatory clinic for movement disorders at our institution and then referred for clinical and imaging examination, regardless of sex, age, disease duration, or medication use. All 42 patients were taking antiparkinsonian drugs. The exclusionary criteria were structural brain lesions, atypical parkinsonism, a Mini-Mental State Exam score \u226424, or any MRI contraindication. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Our institutional review board approved this study. \n\n\n### Clinical evaluation \n  \nA neurologist (JSP) with more than 30 years of experience in movement disorders conducted the clinical evaluations and determined PD severity with the Unified Idiopathic Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III)  and Hoehn & Yahr staging. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the PD patients and HCs are summarized in  . \n  \nSummary of and inter-group comparisons of study participant characteristics. \n      \n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nMRI was performed with a 1.5-T scanner (Optima 360 Advance, General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). The examination protocols included: a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient echo inversion recovery sequence (repetition time (TR)\u2009=\u20098.964\u2009ms, echo time (TE)\u2009=\u20093.796\u2009ms, inversion time (TI)\u2009=\u2009500\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u20098\u00b0, section thickness\u2009=\u20091\u2009mm, field of view (FOV)\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, number of excitations (NEX)\u2009=\u20090, 8); an axial T2-weighted FLAIR sequence with fat suppression (TR\u2009=\u200911,000\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200987.12\u2009ms, TI\u2009=\u20092,700\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200990\u00b0, section thickness\u2009=\u20095\u2009mm, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009190, NEX\u2009=\u20091); and an axial enhanced three-dimensional multi-echo gradient-echo T2*-weighted angiography (ESWAN) sequence (TR\u2009=\u200975.6\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200948.07\u2009ms, flip angle\u2009=\u200920\u00b0, section thickness\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009mm, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009256\u2009\u00d7\u2009256, NEX\u2009=\u20090.686719). For DTI, an isotropic diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence (TR\u2009=\u20098,445\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u200988.5\u2009ms, section thickness\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009mm, FOV\u2009=\u2009240\u2009mm, matrix size\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00d7\u2009100, NEX\u2009=\u20091, number of T2-weighted acquisitions\u2009=\u20094) was applied on an axial plane with diffusion-sensitizing gradients along 26 directions (b-value of 0 and 1000\u2009s/mm ). The total imaging examination time was about 17 min. \n\n\n### Image processing and analysis \n  \nFor image postprocessing, mean diffusivity and FA maps were developed from DTI data after automated segmentation of brain from nonbrain tissues and correction of eddy currents in Advantage Workstation 4.6 (General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). A neuroradiologist (RVO) with more than 10 years of experience, who was blinded to the clinical data, conducted visual evaluation of the images in Osirix Imaging Software Advance Open-Source PACS Workstation DICOM Viewer v.4.1.1 32-bit (Pixmeo, Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland). Subsequently, manual image analysis was used to define three circular regions of interest (ROIs), each with an area of 0.125\u2009cm , including one in the SN of each hemisphere, identified as a dark band on a trace map, as well as one in the cerebral peduncle ( ). These ROIs were copied and pasted onto FA maps ( ). Free-hand defined ROIs were drawn around both putaminal nuclei in the ESWAN sequences ( ), and then also copied and pasted onto FA maps ( ). Oval ROIs (1.0\u2009cm  area) were placed over each side of the thalamus on FA maps ( ). Circular ROIs (0.5\u2009cm  area) were placed in the subcortical white matter of the supplementary motor area (SMA) on FA maps ( ), guided by the parasagittal gyrus bounded posteriorly by primary motor cortex. \n  \nMesencephalon measurements: white circles indicate the substantia nigra (SN) and black circles indicate the cerebral peduncles in mean diffusivity (a) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (b) maps. Putamen measurements: white lines indicate the putamen in ESWAN (c) and FA (d) maps. Thalamus and supplementary motor area (SMA) measurements: white circles indicate measurements in both thalami (e) and black circles indicate SMAs (f) in FA maps. \n  \n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nBased on an infinite population (>10,000) and the national prevalence of PD, we calculated a sample size of 49.  The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was applied to evaluate data distributions. We used   \u03c7   tests for inter-group comparisons of demographic variables and inter-group inferential analyses of clinical variables (parametric data) and used Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for comparisons of variables with non-parametric data. We conducted linear regression analyses to assess the relationships of measured variables with FA measurements. The measures that achieved significance were submitted to a multiple linear regression adjusted for age and sex. The criterion of statistical significance used was   P  \u2009<\u2009.05. \u03b2 values are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analysis was performed by the software SPSS Statistics, version 20.0.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Group characteristics \n  \nCompared to the HC group, the PD patient group had a significantly higher mean age and a significantly greater proportion of males ( ). \n\n\n### Conventional MRI \n  \nAge-related white matter changes were detected in 18/20 HCs (90%) and 38/42 PD patients (90.48%). Applying Fazekas scale,  15 HCs had mild changes (75%) and 2 HCs had moderate changes (10%), while 29 PD patients had mild changes (69.05%), 7 PD patients had moderate changes (16.67%), and 2 PD patients had severe changes (4.76%). No other notable changes were found in these sequences in either group. \n\n\n### Factors that affect and correlate with FA in ROIs \n  \nCompared to HCs, we observed significantly altered mean FA measurements for the PD patient group in the intermediate and dorsal portions of the right SN, as well as in the average of the three measurements in both the right SN and the left SN ( ). Age was a significant factor for FA measurements in the intermediate and dorsal portions of the right SN, averaged FA across the three measurements in the right SN, FA in the intermediate portion of the left SN, averaged FA across the three measurements in the left SN, and FA values in the right and left SMA. FA values obtained for the right and left putamen varied significantly between males and females in both groups ( ). \n  \nComparisons of mean FA measurements between HC and PD groups. \n        \nAnalysis of sex and age effects on FA measurements in both groups. \n      \nAmong patients with PD, we found that disease duration had a significant correlative relationship with FA measurements in the intermediate and dorsal portions of the right SN as well as with mean FA values for the three SN regions ( ). Additionally, among patients with PD, Hoehn & Yahr scale severity scores correlated significantly with FA values in the intermediate and dorsal portions of the right SN, as well as with the average of the three measurements within the right SN. Similarly, Hoehn & Yahr scale severity scores correlated significantly with FA measurements in the intermediate portion of the left SN as well as with the average of the three FA measurements in the left SN ( ). UPDRS III scores correlated significantly with FA measurements in the intermediate portion of the right SN as well as with the average of the three FA measurements in the left SN ( ). \n  \nCorrelation of FA measurements with clinical variables in PD patients. \n      \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, significantly reduced FA values were found in PD patients, compared to HCs. Additionally, we found that some FA measurements in the SN of PD patients correlated inversely with duration of PD and PD severity. Both sex and age had significant effects on FA measurements in ROIs. \n\nIt is well established that aging leads to changes in the function, structure, and physiology of the human brain.  Our finding of a greater prevalence of age-related grade 2/3 white matter changes in the PD patient group, compared to HCs, can be attributed to the older age profile of the PD patient group.  Some FA measurements in the SN were related significantly to age, corroborating the findings of Vaillancourt et\u00a0al.  and a post-mortem study by Jyothi et\u00a0al.  We also observed an effect of age on FA in the SMA, consistent with prior pathology and DTI studies showing a relationship between aging and neurodegeneration. \n\nWe demonstrated a highly significant effect of sex on FA measurements in the putamen, even after adjusting for disease duration and age. Neuroanatomical differences between the sexes may explain observed differences in behavioral and cognitive measures.  In a recent meta-analysis of eight DTI studies of gray matter that used automated voxel-based analyses, Ruigrok et\u00a0al.  found that men had greater neuronal density in the putamen than women, but did not identify sex differences in manual FA measurements of the putamen in the reviewed literature. \n\nThe presently observed trend of more PD-associated FA alterations in the left hemisphere than in the right fits with Knossalla et\u00a0al.\u2019s  description of asymmetric SN involvement in PD. This asymmetry may underlie the lateralization of symptoms experienced by patients with PD, pointing to a new area of DTI exploration in PD research. \n\nGroup differences in FA were more pronounced in the posterior SN than in the anterior SN, consistent with Vaillancourt et\u00a0al.\u2019s  prior demonstration of a highly reproducible, 100% accurate distinction between these areas. Differences between FA measurements in the ventral SN and dorsal SN can be explained by a greater loss of dopaminergic cells in the latter, as demonstrated in a previous postmortem study.  Indeed, nigrossome-1\u2014a cluster of dopaminergic cells that is particularly susceptible to PD degeneration\u2014is located in the dorso-lateral SN. Nigrossome-1 cannot be readily delineated in patients with PD using 3-T susceptibility-weighted imaging due to iron overload.  Consistent with the present findings, this preferential degeneration of the dorsal SN has also been demonstrated in studies that quantified iron overload and neuromelanin by MRI. \n\nImportantly, we found that FA in the SN correlates inversely with PD severity ( ) and duration ( ), though the only prior examination of this correlation in the literature, to our knowledge, did not demonstrate statistically significant correlations.  Of three prior studies employing manual methods examining potential SN FA correlations with Hoehn & Yahr scale scores, two studies demonstrated significant correlations,  consistent with the present results, and one failed to demonstrate such as correlation. \n  \nDistribution of mean FA values obtained for the left SN in relation to UPDRS III scores. \n    \nDistribution of mean FA values obtained for the right SN in relation to PD duration. \n  \nAutomated voxel-based analyses produce findings similar to findings obtained with manual measures,  including significant FA reductions in the SN in patients with PD.  Using both manual and automated FA analyses, Zhan et\u00a0al.  showed an inverse correlation of SN measurements with UPDRS III scores. Using only a manual method, Modrego et\u00a0al.  demonstrated an inverse correlation between these variables. However, Du et\u00a0al.  did not obtain a significant SN FA correlation with UPDRS III scores, probably due to their small number of patients with PD and limited spectrum of scale scores. \n\nWith respect to negative findings in the present study, we did not observe significantly reduced FA in the frontal lobes, putamen, thalamus, or cerebral peduncles in patients with PD. However, a number of prior studies have reported reduced frontal lobe FA in PD and attributed the reduction to degeneration in the premotor cortex and SMA.  FA changes in these regions have been demonstrated even in early-stage PD, prior to clinically significant cortical atrophy.  The age difference between our PD and HC groups may explain, at least in part, our lack of a significant frontal lobe FA reduction in our PD patient group. Previously reported DTI changes in the putamen of patients with PD have been thought to be attributable to dopaminergic nigrostriatal projection loss.  Our negative findings in the putamen, however, are consistent with other studies that conducted manual analyses.  Reductions in FA in the thalamus have been demonstrated in patients with PD, both with manual and automated methods, and this finding has been related to disease severity as well as to dementia and depression.  Notwithstanding, our negative finding for the thalamus is in agreement with two prior DTI studies.  Finally, our not finding FA reductions in the cerebral peduncles of our PD patients is consistent with prior studies; indeed, the peduncles have been used as a reference region to enable distinction of the SN. \n\nReduced FA in the SN can be explained by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, especially in the dorsal SN. The presently observed group differences in SN FA measurements corroborate the findings of seven prior studies that employed manual measurements of FA in the SN.  However, only two of these seven prior studies were performed with a 1.5-T MRI scanner.  The others used 3-T MRI scanners or advanced voxel-based automated methods, which are not readily translatable to clinical application. Importantly, our demonstrations of SN FA reductions correlating inversely with PD duration and severity support the notion that DTI conducted with a 1.5-T MRI scanner can be used to identify PD biomarkers that may be useful for PD diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy management. \n\nThis study has some limitations. First, the lack of gold-standard histopathological diagnoses of PD could lead to diagnostic bias. Secondly, FA values were obtained manually, which could have introduced a measurement bias. Thirdly, free-hand ROI delineation of putaminal nuclei could affect reproducibility and lead to measurement bias. Fourthly, reproducibility could not be assessed because all image analyses were performed by only one observer. Finally, because symptom laterality was not assessed, we could not analyze the potential relationship between FA asymmetry of symptom asymmetry. \n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that PD-related changes in FA can be demonstrated by DTI with a 1.5-T scanner, which allows for examination times that are feasible in clinical practice. Larger sample studies are needed for protocol optimization and standardization, to further validate the present findings, and to evaluate the utility of combining DTI with novel methods, such as iron overload and neuromelanin quantitation methods. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7903830, "text_md5": "f290fb14d1ee8a4d1329404e0f0892b5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 41], "journal": [42, 58], "publication_year": [60, 64], "title": [75, 248], "keywords": [262, 359], "abstract": [372, 2202], "body": [2211, 19613]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33747550, "doi": "10.1177/2058460121993477", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903830", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7903830"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903830\">7903830</a>", "list_title": "PMC7903830  Utility of manual fractional anisotropy measurements in the management of patients with Parkinson disease: a feasibility study with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging system"}

Driven mainly by aging and additional factors such as increasing industrialization and declining smoking rates, this number is expected to rise to over 17 million by 2040 . \n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant advance in diagnosing PD, with novel clinical diagnostic criteria and research criteria for the prodromal disease stage, both proposed by the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) . Despite these updated criteria, clinical diagnosis can often still be challenging, especially in earlier stages of the disease and if performed by nonexperts . A previous clinicopathologic study by Hughes et al., which analyzed over 100 clinically diagnosed patients with PD, showed a relevant misdiagnosis rate of 10% . Moreover, Adler et al. demonstrated, among patients clinically diagnosed with PD who underwent neuropathological examination, only 53% accuracy for a clinical diagnosis of PD in an early disease stage with less than five years duration . \n\nRecent developments of new neuroimaging techniques have been made possible with the emergence of high-field MR magnets, more sophisticated head coils, and improved MRI sequences. Neuroimaging in PD has expanded its role from just excluding secondary causes of parkinsonism to the appearance of new biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis across different stages of the disease, as well as assisting in its differential diagnosis with atypical parkinsonisms (AP), non-neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism or even other movement disorders, such as essential tremor or functional movement disorders . \n\nThe present study describes and critically reviews the current knowledge and most striking advances in MRI and dopamine transporter neuroimaging responsible for this role shift. \n\n\n## SEARCH STRATEGY \n  \nWe performed a non-systematic literature review through the PubMed database, using the disease-specific keyword \"Parkinson\", together with one of the modality-specific keywords: \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d, \u201cdiffusion tensor\u201d, \u201cdiffusion-weighted\u201d, \u201cneuromelanin\u201d, \u201cnigrosome-1\u201d, \u201csingle-photon emission computed tomography\u201d, \u201cdopamine transporter imaging\u201d. The search was restricted to articles written in English and published between January 2010 and February 2022. All abstracts were screened for relevance, and the most pertinent articles were then read and discussed. \n\n\n## STRUCTURAL IMAGING IN T1/T2 MRI \n  \nIn the early stages of PD, structural changes on conventional MRI are usually minimal or absent . Although not essential for the clinical diagnosis, MRI should be requested at least one time during the disease course with two main objectives. The first is the exclusion of secondary causes of parkinsonism in the conventional sequences of T1 and T2, such as lesions with mass effect, demyelinating lesions, vascular alterations ( ), normal pressure hydrocephalus, signs of deposit of metals (copper, iron, and manganese), and signs of traumatic brain injury . The second is the search for imaging signs suggestive of AP. \n\n   Vascular parkinsonism. Axial FLAIR MRI shows hyperintense foci involving the basal ganglia, thalamus, periventricular and subcortical white matter related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease  .     \n\nAP comprises a group of less common and pathologically distinct disorders than PD, sharing their neurodegenerative condition and a parkinsonian syndrome as a clinical hallmark. From a neuropathological perspective, they can be divided, in a simplified way, into tauopathies, which comprises Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and synucleinopathies, which comprises Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) . Although these disorders tend to have a poor dopaminergic response and eventually manifest other signs and symptoms that can be distinguished from PD, these features may not be present early in the disease, and the differential diagnosis among these entities is challenging. In turn, T1/T2 structural MRI can help identify neuroimaging biomarkers that support the diagnosis of atypical parkinsonisms, with limited sensitivity and reasonable specificity. \n\nPSP is clinically manifested by symmetric parkinsonism, supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, and early gait instability. Radiologically, the hallmark is midbrain area reduction leading to the visual identification of the \u201chummingbird sign\u201d on the sagittal plane (specificity 99%, sensitivity 50%) and the \u201cmorning glory sign\u201d on the axial plane (specificity 97%, sensitivity 37%); in addition to superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP) size reduction in the coronal plane . Additionally, the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI), calculated through the measurement of the ratios of the pons to midbrain area and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) to SCP widths, has shown high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing PSP from PD, multiple system atrophy- parkinsonian type (MSA-P) and healthy controls . \n\nCBD is clinically characterized by asymmetric parkinsonism, often accompanied by dystonia, myoclonus, and cortical deficits. Structural MRI may demonstrate frontoparietal cortical atrophy contralateral to the most affected . MSA is clinically characterized by various combinations of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, and ataxia. In MSA-P, bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintense rim lining the dorsolateral borders of the putamen (\u201cputaminal rim\u201d sign), T2 putaminal hypointensity, and T1 atrophy of the putamen, cerebellum, pons, and MCP can be found. Regarding the cerebellar-predominant type (MSA-C), T2/FLAIR cruciform pontine hyperintensity known as \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign (specificity 100%, sensitivity 58%), T2 MCP hyperintensity, and T1 atrophy of the putamen and MCP can be observed .  \n\n, included in this article, illustrates the radiological signs and the MRPI calculation described above. \n\n   Atypical parkinsonism. Progressive supranuclear palsy. Midsagittal T1-weighted MRI (A) shows the \u201chummingbird sign\u201d, result of selective atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum, with flattening or concave outline to the superior aspect of the midbrain, and relative pontine preservation. Axial FLAIR-weighted MRI shows SCP atrophy (B), reduction of anteroposterior midline midbrain diameter, at the level of the superior colliculi on axial imaging demonstrating the \u201cMickey Mouse sign\u201d, and loss of the lateral convex margin of the tegmentum of midbrain demonstrating the \u201cMorning Glory sign\u201d (C). Magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) is calculated by multiplying the pons area to midbrain area ratio (D), in the midsagittal plane, by the middle cerebellar peduncle (F) width to superior cerebellar peduncle width ratio (E). Multiple system atrophy- parkinsonian type (MSA-P): Axial FLAIR (G),Proton Density (PD) (H) and Gradient Echo (GRE) (I) weighted MRI show linear region of high signal surrounding the lateral aspect of the putamen flatted demonstrating the \u201cputaminal rim sign\u201d. Cerebellar predominant type MSA (MSA-C). Midsagittal and axial T2-weighted (J,K) and PD-weighted MRI (L) show disproportionate atrophy of the cerebellum and pons, specially pontine tegmentum and middle cerebellar peduncle, with T2 hyperintensity in the pons forms a cross on axial images, representing selective degeneration of transverse pontocerebellar tracts and median pontine raphe (\u201chot cross bun sign\u201d). Corticobasal degeneration. Right Parasagittal T1-weighted (M) and axial FLAIR-weighted (N) MRI images show asymmetric cortical atrophy of perirolandic gyri, most evident on the right.    \n\n\n## IRON-SENSITIVE MRI, NIGROSOME-1 AND DORSAL NIGRAL HYPERINTENSITY \n  \nThe   substantia nigra   is a key structure for understanding the anatomical and functional changes that involve neurodegeneration in PD . The   substantia nigra   pars compacta (SNc), located dorsally in the midbrain, contains dopaminergic neurons distributed in two different regions, from an immunohistochemical setting: a calbindin-rich matrix and poor-calbindin zones, called nigrosomes. There are five nigrosomes, and the largest, located dorsally in the   substantia nigra  , corresponds to nigrosome-1 . \n\nThrough high-field magnetic susceptibility-weighted imaging, the nigrosome-1 reveals itself as a hyperintense linear, \u201ccomma\u201d or \u201cwedge\u201d shaped structure in the posterior third of the   substantia nigra  , labeled dorsal nigral hyperintensity .  \n\nMedially, dorsal nigral hyperintensity is surrounded by low SWI signal intensity from the medial lemniscus, while laterally and anterior dorsal nigral hyperintensity is surrounded by a low signal from the pars compacta   substantia nigra  . Consequently, on axial imaging through high-field magnetic susceptibility-weighted imaging, nigrosome-1, and its surrounding structures resemble the morphology of a swallow's tail, called the \u201cswallow-tail sign\u201d appearance of the healthy nigrosome-1, as shown in  . \n\n   Nigrosome-1. Assessment of the substantia nigra using 3T high resolution susceptibility-weighted MR imaging at the level of nigrosome-1 in 2 different patients. The control subject (A) shows normal nigrosome-1 present bilaterally (arrow) and the PD patient (B) demonstrates right nigrosome-1 absent (arrowhead).    \n\nConversely, while it is unclear whether it is a cause or a consequence in pathogenesis, there is an iron overload in the   substantia nigra   in patients with PD . A histopathological study shows a 31-35% increase in the total iron content of the parkinsonian   substantia nigra   when compared to healthy controls . \n\nConsequently, through high-field magnetic susceptibility sequences on MRI, due to iron overload in the context of nigrostriatal degeneration, loss of dorsal nigral hyperintensity and loss of the \u201cswallow-tail sign\u201d can be observed in PD patients, as shown in  .  \n\nLoss of dorsal nigral hyperintensity has emerged as a potential biomarker to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls . A recent meta-analysis including ten studies, 364 PD and 264 control patients, demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of the absence of dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity to differentiate between the two groups greater than 90% . However, the same study showed that the absence of DNH was also present in 89.4% of patients with AP disorders, probably reflecting the joint nigrostriatal degeneration of these conditions . Moreover, two studies demonstrated that the absence of DNH could predict ipsilateral changes in neuroimaging of the dopamine transporter with sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% . \n\nTherefore, despite an emerging potential biomarker to demonstrate nigrostriatal neurodegeneration with apparently reasonable reproducibility to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls, high-field iron-sensitive images seem to have little accuracy for the differential diagnosis between neurodegenerative Parkinsonisms . \n\nIn addition to its diagnostic value in PD, recent literature investigates the role of iron-sensitive MRI as a possible biomarker of disease progression through different imaging patterns depending on the stage of the disease . A longitudinal study comparing neuroimaging findings in R2* relaxation imaging and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) across different disease stages showed a significantly SNc faster increase on R2* in later-stage PD (>5 years of disease) when compared to early-stage PD (<1year) or middle-stage PD (<5 years) . \n\nWhen it comes to a potential biomarker during prodromal disease, a comparison among healthy controls, idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) patients, and PD patients through QSM demonstrated higher mean magnetic susceptibility values in the bilateral   substantia nigra   from iRBD patients compared to healthy controls. In contrast, mean magnetic susceptibility values were positively correlated with disease duration in the   substantia nigra  . Besides a potential diagnostic biomarker during the prodromal phase, such findings suggest that QSM can help monitor disease progression even in its earliest stages. Accordingly, PD patients had increased iron in the bilateral   substantia nigra  , globus pallidus, left red nucleus, and elevated iron levels in the bilateral   substantia nigra   compared with iRBD patients. This finding suggests the role of QSM as a biomarker of disease progression, which may be maintained after the phenoconversion from iRBD to PD . \n\nDespite the increasing availability of high-field scanners and the use of magnetic susceptibility sequences in the complementary investigation of suspected PD, with emphasis on DNH assessment, there is no definitive consensus on its use yet, and the lack of standardized imaging protocols, including spatial resolution and imaging planes, may limit their usefulness . \n\n\n## NEUROMELANIN-SENSITIVE MRI \n  \nNeuromelanin is an intracellular, dark, and insoluble pigment found in higher concentrations in catecholaminergic neurons, especially dopaminergic neurons of the   substantia nigra   and noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus . Neuromelanin has the property of high affinity to chelate iron and bind neurotoxic metals that could promote neurodegeneration, and it appears to have antioxidant properties contributing to regulating the cellular oxidative stress, protecting endogenous dopamine . \n\nThe neuromelanin-iron complex acts as a paramagnetic agent . In this context, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI techniques have been improved in recent years: on T1-weighted fast spin-echo images at high-field MRI, brain regions containing melanin can be identified as areas of high signal intensity when compared to surrounding brain tissue ( ) . \n\n   Neuromelanin. Assessment of the substantia nigra using 3T high resolution T1-weighted MR imaging in the midbrain structures in 2 different cases. The control subject (A) shows normal nigral hyperintensity present bilaterally (thick arrow) and the PD patient (B) demonstrates right loss of dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity (arrowhead) and left dorsolateral nigral hyperintensity reduced (thin arrow).    \n\nIn PD, neuromelanin-containing neurons preferentially degenerate . Consequently, through signal attenuation in regions where neurodegeneration occurs ( ), neuromelanin-sensitive MRI has emerged in several studies as a potential imaging biomarker to diagnose and track PD progression . \n\nIn early PD patients, the lateral portion of the   substantia nigra   appears to be the topography where signal attenuation is most relevant . Measurement of signal attenuation in the lateral portion of the   substantia nigra   demonstrated sensitivity and specificity greater than 70% and 80%, respectively, comparing early-stage PD patients with healthy controls . Interestingly, the measurement of signal attenuation at the locus coeruleus has been shown to have greater sensitivity and specificity (82% sensitivity and 90% specificity), which suggests early neuronal depletion in the early disease stages and highlights the importance of emerging biomarkers in deepening the knowledge about the mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in PD . \n\nOn the other hand, the role of neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a tool for the differential diagnosis between PD and AP presents less clear evidence, despite recent advances. In a prior study including healthy controls and early-onset parkinsonism patients, after a one-and-a-half year follow-up of PD, PSP, and MSA-P diagnosis, the signal intensity of the lateral, central, and medial parts of the SNc, the locus coeruleus, and the contrast ratios against adjacent white-matter structures were calculated. The lateral SNc contrast ratio was lower in the PD and MSA-P groups than in the PSP and control groups, while the contrast ratio of the locus was observed to be lower in the PD group than in the other groups . In another recent study, the SNc estimated in neuromelanin-sensitive MRI was significantly smaller in PSP patients compared to PD patients and healthy controls . \n\nAs an emerging neuroimaging biomarker, there is concern about assessing coherence and reproducibility with more well-established biomarkers such as dopamine transporter neuroimaging. The   substantia nigra   area on neuromelanin-sensitive MRI appears to be directly correlated with dopamine transporter density on SPECT neuroimaging, suggesting that neuromelanin-MRI may be a potential biomarker to quantify   substantia nigra   pathology and dopaminergic loss in PD .  \n\nFrom the same perspective as a potential biomarker of PD progression, through longitudinal follow-up, the   substantia nigra   volume and signal intensity on neuromelanin-MRI showed a more significant reduction with longer disease duration . The levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) in patients did not correlate with any   substantia nigra   MRI measurements, suggesting that dopaminergic medication did not modify neuromelanin-MRI signal changes . \n\nThe recent literature suggests that neuromelanin-sensitive MRI is a potential biomarker for PD, but it still lacks standardized image processing and analysis protocols, which may limit its use in daily clinical practice . \n\n\n## DIFFUSION IMAGING \n  \nDiffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging might be a helpful tool to indirectly quantify the microstructural integrity through analysis of the overall displacement of water molecules, characterized as mean diffusivity, and the degree of displacement in space known as fractional anisotropy . Briefly, degeneration of white matter tracts leads to an increase in mean diffusivity, while a decrease in fractional anisotropy is expected . Consequently, analysis of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy in structures affected by neurodegeneration in PD has been a research target.  \n\nPrior studies described a significant reduction in fractional anisotropy in the   substantia nigra   in PD patients compared to controls . Such reduction was more pronounced in the caudal portion of the   substantia nigra  , which is congruent with the more intense neuronal loss in this structure as neurodegeneration progresses . A reduction in fractional anisotropy was also observed in the anterior olfactory structures, in line with previous observations from olfactory disturbances in PD patients .  \n\nLiterature data are conflicting: some studies report no fractional anisotropy or mean diffusivity significant differences between healthy controls and early PD patients . One longitudinal study showed no significant differences, at the baseline, between healthy controls and PD patients. However, after a mean follow-up of 19 months, the PD patients showed a   substantia nigra   significant increased mean diffusivity and reduced fractional anisotropy. This change observed during follow-up analysis suggests that   substantia nigra   diffusion measure may be a valuable biomarker of PD progression . \n\nNew image postprocessing methods, notably freewater imaging, also seem to have a promising role as potential new biomarkers . Freewater in the posterior   substantia nigra   is elevated in PD patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, freewater level was correlated with disease duration, the severity of motor symptoms, and degree of dopaminergic loss on neuroimaging of the dopamine transporter, suggesting that it may be a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression . \n\nHence, diffusion-weighted, tensor, and freewater imaging can also be valuable tools for differential diagnosis between PD and AP. A recent meta-analysis showed a 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity of diffusion-weighted MRI to differentiate MSA-P from PD through the analysis of putaminal diffusion, which is increased in patients with MSA-P . More recently, a study proposed an approach involving diffusion-weighted imaging, free water postprocessing, in conjunction with automated analysis and machine learning algorithms, labeled automated imaging differentiation of parkinsonism (AID-P), as a practical and promising tool in differentiating PD from AP .  \n\n\n## DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER IMAGING \n  \nIn addition to MRI advances, dopamine transporter neuroimaging rises as an essential milestone in the diagnostic management of patients with parkinsonism or suspected PD. Presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) consists of a transmembrane sodium chloride-dependent protein expressed only in presynaptic dopaminergic cells, responsible for dopamine reuptake from the synaptic cleft . The administration of radiotracers with high specificity for DAT combined with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging technique allows the assessment of DAT density at presynaptic terminals . [123I]FP-CIT (123I-ioflupane) correspond to the most commonly used ligand , although there are other radiotracers also with high specificity for DAT, such as [99mTc]TRODAT (frequently used in Brazil), [123I]\u03b2-CIT and [123I]IPT . Standard DAT-SPECT imaging appears as two intense symmetric \u201ccomma-shaped\u201d regions of activity in the striatum ( ).  \n\n   DAT-SPECT from healthy controls and from PD patients at different stages of the disease. A standard DAT-SPECT imaging appears as two intense symmetric \u201ccomma-shaped\u201d regions of activity in the striatum (A, B,C). With the progression of PD, there is a decline in radiotracer uptake that follows a gradient from posterior to anterior structures, as shown through DAT-SPECT obtained during early (D,E,F), moderate (G,HI) and late (J,K,L) stage of PD.    \n\nDue to neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal pathway occurring in neurodegenerative parkinsonisms, there is a reduction in the expression of DAT on presynaptic terminals, which leads to a reduction in radioligand striatal uptake in DAT-SPECT . Decreased radiotracer binding, especially in the early stages of the disease, shows a rostrocaudal gradient pattern, with relative sparing of the caudate nucleus compared to the putamen ( )  . Loss in uptake also tends to be asymmetrical, as it is often more pronounced in the contralateral side to parkinsonism . Unlike other neuroimaging biomarkers previously discussed, which are mostly restricted to the research environment, a normal DAT-SPECT has been incorporated as an absolute exclusion criterion in the 2015 MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for PD . \n\nTherefore, DAT-SPECT is a valuable tool in differentiating with high accuracy presynaptic neurodegenerative parkinsonisms from other clinical conditions, such as essential tremor and secondary parkinsonisms, such as vascular, psychogenic, or drug-induced parkinsonism . Therefore, if DAT radiotracer binding is normal, the diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism becomes less likely . DAT-SPECT, specifically 123I-ioflupane SPECT, commercially traded as DaTSCAN\u00ae, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency as a complementary tool in the differential diagnosis between essential tremor and PD or other neurodegenerative parkinsonism related-tremor  . \n\nHowever, since both PD and AP are characterized by presynaptic involvement and nigrostriatal degeneration in their etiopathogenesis, the role of DAT-imaging in the differential diagnosis between the two conditions seems limited . Some attempts to identify different patterns of ligand uptake among these conditions have been made, such as the recognition of more asymmetric uptake changes in patients with PD and corticobasal degeneration at a population level compared to patients with PSP and MSA . Thus, on an individual level, DAT imaging does not appear to be a reliable tool in the discrimination of different causes of degenerative parkinsonism, and its use is not recommended for this purpose in routine clinical practice . \n\nThe acronym SWEDD (scans without evidence for dopaminergic deficit) was coined after recognizing that some patients had normal DAT imaging, despite a presumed clinical diagnosis of PD . As a recent review points out, patients with SWEDD form a heterogeneous group: most cases correspond to diverse medical conditions misdiagnosed as PD, such as essential tremor, dystonia, secondary or psychogenic parkinsonisms, depression with psychomotor slowness, and soft extrapyramidal signs of the elderly . Conversely, a portion of SWEDD patients remained under the main hypothesis of PD, and some of them converted to altered DAT imaging during their follow-up, supporting the notion that an initial normal DAT-SPECT cannot permanently exclude early degenerative parkinsonism .  \n\nAs the term SWEDD does not represent a single clinical entity, but only an absence of a dopaminergic imaging abnormality from a largely heterogeneous group of patients, some authors defend that this term should be abandoned . \n\nFinally, increasing data regarding dopamine transporter imaging has shown its role in the prodromal phase of PD. In patients with hyposmia, abnormal uptake on DAT-SPECT is a predictive factor of phenoconversion to PD, while in patients with iRBD, a DAT deficit identifies patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy . DAT imaging may also help to understand the heterogeneity of PD during the prodromal phase. Recent studies suggest two subtypes of prodromal PD according to the temporal and spatial pattern of alpha-synuclein progression: a body-first subtype, characterized by the early involvement of enteric autonomic nervous system and later progression to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve, and a brain-first subtype, characterized by the early brain involvement, with later progression to the brainstem and the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Through a multimodal approach, early alteration in DAT imaging helps to identify brain-first subtype prodromal disease patients . \n\nIn conclusion, neuroimaging biomarkers in PD have made substantial progress in recent years with the advent of high-field MRI, improved sequences, and dopamine transporter ligands capable of assessing the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway in vivo.  \n\nAlthough some of these emerging biomarkers lack validation in the earlier stages of the disease, their role in clinical practice and diagnostic accuracy might increase with the future establishment of standardized image processing and analysis protocols, new forms of a multimodal approach, and machine-learning algorithms. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9491424, "text_md5": "20fa900d6221575b25a8b50d78653567", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 143], "journal": [144, 162], "publication_year": [164, 168], "title": [179, 291], "keywords": [305, 674], "abstract": [687, 2252], "body": [2261, 28785]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 35976320, "doi": "10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2022-S130", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9491424", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9491424"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9491424\">9491424</a>", "list_title": "PMC9491424  Magnetic resonance and dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of Parkinson\u00b4s disease: a narrative review"}

Theoretically, there are some concerns regarding the use of sacral neuromodulation implants in patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and cardiac conduction diseases because of the risk of interference with electrical impulses. This study aimed to describe the safety of using sacral neuromodulation to treat nonobstructive urinary retention in patients with a cardiac conduction disease. We report a case in which sacral neuromodulation was performed to treat nonobstructive urinary retention in a 25-year-old woman with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome who was receiving antiarrhythmic medication. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and urodynamic studies after presenting with urinary symptoms at a urology clinic. She was then diagnosed with nonobstructive urinary retention. She underwent two-staged InterStim therapy, which involved implanting a permanent tined lead through the S3 foramen in the first stage and an implantable pulse generator in the second stage. The patient responded well to the therapy, and the frequency of clean intermittent catheterization was reduced from 6 times a day to once daily with only 250 mL drained per day. The cardiology team recommended intraoperative cardiac monitoring and postoperative electrocardiogram monitoring. No interference was observed between the implantable pulse generator and the cardiac rhythm on electrocardiography. She experienced no exacerbation of her cardiac symptoms. Sacral neuromodulation in a patient with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome appears to have been safe. Further, prospective and randomized studies with larger study samples are required to investigate the safety of these implants in WPW patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac condition in which the atrial impulses reach the ventricle through an accessory pathway in addition to normal atrioventricular conduction. Diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of WPW syndrome include a delta wave, a wide QRS complex, and a short PR interval. WPW symptoms typically include palpitations and a history of syncope. WPW can lead to sudden unexpected death. The reported prevalence of WPW varies widely in literature and is estimated to be 0.36/1000 with a peak of 0.61/1000 in ages 20\u201324 years.  Treatment options for this condition range from antiarrhythmic medications to ablation of the accessory pathway, or a combination of the two. Treatment goals include symptom control and reducing the risk of sudden death. \n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) InterStim therapy (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA) for refractory bladder overactivity and urge incontinence in 1997 and for nonobstructive urinary retention in 1999. \n\nThe mechanism of action of SNM in the bladder is poorly understood; however, it modulates the reflex arc of the pelvic floor neuromuscular complex, which controls the voiding function of the bladder, via afferent pathways. \n\nBecause of a theoretical risk of interference with electrical impulses, there are some concerns regarding the use of SNM implants in patients with cardiac pacemakers. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the use of SNM in a patient with WPW syndrome. Here, we present a case report detailing the successful use of SNM for nonobstructive urinary retention in a patient with WPW syndrome. \n\n\n## Case Report \n  \nA 25-year-old woman with WPW syndrome ( ) presented to our urology clinic complaining of a nine-year history of nonobstructive urinary retention. Three years prior, she had undergone cardiac ablation, which was unsuccessful, and she was prescribed a 250-mg daily dose of verapamil (Pfizer co, New York, USA) an antiarrhythmic medication to normalize her cardiac rhythm. She had no other medical conditions or family history of urinary retention. She reported multiple visits to the emergency department for urgent decompression by urethral catheterization and having attended multiple urology clinics over the last nine years and undergone multiple diagnostic ultrasounds for the investigation of her urinary retention. The ultrasound images showed an unremarkable upper urinary tract and a smooth bladder with a volume of one liter. Urodynamic studies revealed no measurable detrusor activity. Despite a bladder volume greater than 487 mL, the patient had no urge to void, and her electromyographic study was normal ( ). She was unable to void after the urodynamic study. As a result, she was diagnosed with nonobstructive urinary retention and was prescribed clean intermittent catheterization four times daily. In addition to her nine-year history of nonobstructive urinary retention, the patient had also experienced constipation over the same time period. She had no other past urologic history and no known neurologic disorders.   \nThe electrocardiogram prior to antiarrhythmic treatment. The electrocardiogram shows a short PR interval, a delta wave, wide QRS complex, and ST depression. \n    \nThe urodynamic study. A summary of the urodynamic study showing a postvoid residual volume of 487 mL with a voided volume of only 1.4 mL and almost no measurable detrusor pressure. \n  \n\nThe patient was referred to the author\u2019s clinic for further investigation and treatment. A one-liter postvoid residual volume was drained through a Foley\u2019s catheter (Sterimed Group, India). We attempted a two-week trial of tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg daily (omnic ocas, SAJA CO, Jeddah SA). However, this was discontinued due to serious side-effects (palpitations and orthostatic hypotension), and the patient was advised to continue with the clean intermittent catheterization every four to six hours. This posed no problems, aside from a few urinary tract infections, which were treated according to the urine cultures and sensitivities with oral antibiotics. For the last nine years, intermittent catheterization had not succeeded in achieving any improvement in symptoms or spontaneous voiding. We ordered an outpatient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine and pelvis one week after her initial consult at the author\u2019s clinic, where no neurologic, urinary, or gynecological abnormalities were observed. Based on the surgeon\u2019s preference, we then recommended two-stage SNM as a definitive treatment for her urinary retention. \n\nThe patient gave consent for a two-staged SNM procedure. Under local anesthesia, conscious sedation, and \ufb02uoroscopic guidance, the first SNM stage was performed using the Medtronic unit InterStim therapy (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA). The patient was placed in the prone position with both feet at the edge of the operating table to evaluate hallux movement with stimulation. After marking the sacral spine, local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals India Ltd, India) was administered in the S3 region. The sacral neuromodulation kit was used including spinal needles, an introducer, a tined permanent lead, a portable generator, a disposable wire, and connector (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA). Thereafter, a spinal needle was inserted into the left S3 foramen, and we tested for contractions of the levator ani and movement of the hallux. An introducer then replaced the spinal needle, 2 cm deep to the sacral foramen. Finally, the components of the InterStim (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA) were implanted by feeding a tined permanent lead over the introducer and connecting it to a portable generator using a different incision site, disposable wire, and a connector. The procedure was performed under continuous ECG monitoring. The patient was discharged home with a portable generator the following day. \n\nThe patient presented for her first follow-up appointment one week after the first stage of the implantation. At that time, she reported spontaneous voiding four times daily and a reduction in the frequency of catheterization to once daily with a urinary drainage of only 200 mL. The patient tolerated the first stage well, with no reported side-effects; therefore, we planned the second-stage SNM to be implanted ten days later. This consisted of the implantation of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) from InterStim (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA) in the left buttock under sterile technique and local anesthesia. At her six-week follow-up appointment, the patient reported a consistent reduction in the frequency of clean intermittent catheterization from six times to once daily with a urinary drainage of only 250 mL. \n\nWe consulted the Cardiology team both pre- and postoperatively. They requested continuous intraoperative cardiac monitoring and a postoperative ECG. The ECG did not show any significant changes, and there was no exacerbation of her cardiac symptoms. Furthermore, the one-month postoperative ECGs, which were performed when the SNM device was on and then when the device was off, showed no changes in her cardiac rhythm ( ). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at King Fahad Medical City (IRB Log No. 19-636E) and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for publication of data was obtained from the patient.   \nElectrocardiograms with the sacral neuromodulation device in both on and off modes. (  A  ) An electrocardiogram performed with the sacral neuromodulation implant in \u201coff\u201d mode shows no changes and a sinus rhythm in a patient on antiarrhythmic medication. (  B  ) An electrocardiogram performed with the sacral neuromodulation implant in \u201con\u201d mode shows no changes and a sinus rhythm in a patient on antiarrhythmic medication. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNonobstructive urinary retention is an indication for SNM with InterStim therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to discuss a very rare coincidence of SNM implantation for nonobstructive urinary retention in a patient with WPW syndrome. Jonas et al  reported the efficacy of SNM in 177 patients with refractory nonobstructive urinary retention. Sixty-eight of the 177 patients qualified for SNM implantation based on a percutaneous testing trial. Thirty-seven patients were randomly assigned for SNM administration, while 31 were designated to be the control group, where the implantation of the SNM device was delayed for six months. The authors reported that 69% of the patients in the SNM group had successful spontaneous voiding and were free of intermittent catheterization, and 14% of the participants reported a 50% reduction in bladder residual volume. The postvoid residual volume decreased in 83% of patients in the SNM group, compared to only 9% in the control group, at six months. These results were deemed statistically signi\ufb01cant, and the authors concluded that SNM implants should be offered to patients with chronic urinary retention. However, none of the patients in this study had any cardiac conditions (listed as an exclusion criterion), including WPW syndrome. \n\nGhazi et al  studied the safety of SNM in three patients with a cardiac pacemaker. Using the Medtronic unit InterStim (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA), these patients underwent the first trial using percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) in the S3 foramen using a temporary lead. All three patients reported a more than 50% improvement in their bladder-overactivity symptoms (mainly urgency and urge incontinence), and a SNM device was implanted in each patient. One of these patients had her SNM implant removed after two months for a non-cardiac reason, while the other two were followed-up for six months, and they maintained their voiding improvement with no cardiac symptoms. Postoperative programming was done under ECG monitoring by a cardiologist. No interference was observed between the InterStim (Medtronic Inc., Minnesota, USA) implantable pulse generator and the cardiac pacemaker. The safety of SNM in the presence of a cardiac pacemaker was reported even when testing with maximum SNM stimulation. \n\nIn 2007, Wallace et al  reported on the safety of implanting SNM implants in three patients with a cardiac pacemaker for urge incontinence and an overactive bladder. The SNM implants were implanted under intraoperative and postoperative cardiac monitoring. All three patients reported a greater than 50% improvement in their voiding symptoms, and there was no evidence of interference from the SNM in these patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe efficacy of SNM in the management of nonobstructive urinary retention is well established; however, the safety of SNM in patients with WPW syndrome on antiarrhythmic medication has not been previously investigated in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature to explore this. The limitation of this study is that it is a case report on a single patient; hence, further prospective and randomized studies with larger study samples on the safety of these implants in WPW patients are highly recommended. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7308758, "text_md5": "30b3c17ebb55671fe49ae51c7f274a4c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 19], "journal": [20, 32], "publication_year": [34, 38], "title": [49, 135], "keywords": [149, 284], "abstract": [297, 2267], "body": [2276, 13556]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 32607315, "doi": "10.2147/RRU.S258403", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308758", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7308758"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308758\">7308758</a>", "list_title": "PMC7308758  Sacral Neuromodulation in a Patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome: A Case Report"}

The diagnosis of PD can be straightforward in patients with typical clinical presentation of cardinal signs, but misdiagnosis of PD is not uncommon. In a clinical\u2010pathological study, the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of PD is not high, with only 76% of postmortem confirmed cases being diagnosed correctly (Rajput, Rozdilsky, & Rajput,\u00a0 ). The most common misdiagnoses are related to Atypical Parkinson's disease (APD) such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration (Horvath, Burkhard, Bouras, & K\u00f6vari\u00a0 ; Levin, Kurz, Arzberger, Giese, & H\u00f6glinger\u00a0 ). Since prognosis and treatment options of PD and APD are substantially different, differential diagnosis of PD from APD is critical for clinicians. \n\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA), one of the most common APD, is an adult\u2010onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by a combination of parkinsonism, autonomic disorder, and cerebellar ataxia (Coon et al.,\u00a0 ). Based on the predominant symptoms of the disease, MSA is categorized into two forms of MSA: MSA with predominant Parkinsonism (MSA\u2010P) and MSA with predominant cerebellar features (MSA\u2010C) (Gilman et al.,\u00a0 ). The differential diagnosis of MSA from PD can be challenging since MSA shares some clinical features with PD, especially at the early stage of the disease (McKay & Cheshire,\u00a0 ). In addition, some features, which can differentiate MSA from PD, such as poor responsiveness to levodopa, autonomic dysfunction, and cerebellar incoordination, may take several years to occur (Bhatia, Stamelou, Fanciulli, & Wenning,\u00a0 ). Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate these disease using clinical criteria alone, and efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of the differential diagnosis with imaging methods. \n\nMany imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been used to differentiate PD from MSA and other atypical Parkinsonism (Kwon, Choi, Kim, Lee, & Chung,\u00a0 ,  ; Meyer, Frings, R\u00fccker, & Hellwig\u00a0 ; Walker et al.,\u00a0 ). The differential diagnosis can be assisted by the characteristic features of MSA revealed by MRI, such as atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum, and putaminal hyperintensive rim and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign (Hughes, Daniel, Ben\u2010Shlomo, & Lees,\u00a0 ; Poewe & Wenning,\u00a0 ). However, it remains unclear whether these MRI findings are valid for differentiation of MSA from PD. In addition, the MRI findings for differentiation between MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C have not well studied. \n\nMulti\u2010tracer PET including  F\u2010dopamine PET, dopamine transporter PET, dopamine receptor PET, and tau PET increasingly used for diagnosis and differentiation of PD and APD. However, an overlap between PD and MSA in these PET images limits their usefulness in the differential diagnosis (Koga, Ono, Sahara, Higuchi, & Dickson,  ; Niccolini & Politis,\u00a0 ). Metabolic brain imaging by  F\u2010fluorodeoxyglucose ( F\u2010FDG) PET has showed characteristic reduction in glucose metabolism in the lentiform nucleus and cerebellum in MSA patients (Eckert & Eidelberg,\u00a0 ; Meyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ), which can differentiate MSA patients from PD patients, especially at the early disease stages when no characteristic features occur on MRI. However, the patterns of glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients have not been well established yet. \n\nIn this study, we aimed to characterize the differences in clinical features, MRI abnormality, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET for differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\n\n## SUBJECTS AND METHODS \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nThis study included 30 PD patients (16 males and 14 females), 22 MSA\u2010P patients and 28 MSA\u2010C patients, and 44 age\u2010matched healthy controls. All these patients underwent head MRI, among them 20 PD patients (14 males, age 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0years), 11 MSA\u2010P patients (5 males, age 67.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years), and 13 MSA\u2010C patients (6 males, age 59.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years) underwent both MRI and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET examinations. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Tianjin Medical University, and all subjects gave their informed consent. The PD patients were diagnosed according to MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (Postuma et al.,\u00a0 ), and MSA patients were diagnosed according to the Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy by Gilman et\u00a0al.\u00a0( ). The clinical data were listed in Table\u00a0 . Patients with drug\u2010induced Parkinsonism, vascular Parkinsonism, supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies were excluded. Patients were evaluated by the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part I, II and III, and Hoehn\u2010Yahr stage. \n  \nClinical characteristics of PD patients, MSA\u2010P patients, MSA\u2010C patients \n    \n\n### Magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients using MRI device (GE, USA), and a circular polarized head coil. All patients had axial T1\u2010weighted Fluid\u2010Attenuated Inversion Recovery Sequence (T1FLAIR), T2\u2010weighted images (T2WI), sagittal T1FLAIR, and coronal T2WI. T1FLAIR was performed as follows: repetition time (TR), 2000\u20132100\u00a0ms; inversion time(TI), 750\u00a0ms; and echo time (TE), 10\u201330\u00a0ms. T2WI was performed as follows: TR. 4000\u20135000\u00a0ms; TE, 100\u2013160\u00a0ms. The slice thickness was set at 6\u00a0mm with a interslice gap of 2\u00a0mm. \n\nMRI images were obtained at pons, cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebrum, and were evaluated by two blinded radiologists, focusing on the changes in infratentorial parameters (cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign), and supratentorial parameters (signal decrease in the basal ganglia, putaminal hyperintensive rim, and cortical atrophy). \n\n\n### F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging \n  \nThe PET scans were performed in a 3\u2010dimensional mode using GE Discovery LS PET/CT system. A computerized tomography image was obtained for attenuation correction. The subjects fasted for at least 6\u00a0hr and had no psychiatric drugs for at least 2\u00a0weeks before the PET scanning procedure. Subjects lied supine in a dark and quiet room for 15\u00a0min and were administered with an intravenous bolus injection of 185\u2013370\u00a0MBq (5\u201310\u00a0mCi/)  F\u2010FDG. After 40\u00a0min of rest, the heads of subjects were held with fixation strips, and  F\u2010FDG scan was obtained. The scanner was aligned parallel to the orbitomeatal line using a laser beam. Series of PET images were acquired using a rotating position emission detector. Three\u2010dimensional data acquisition mode was performed, and cross\u2010sectional, coronal, and sagittal images were collected with slice thickness of 2\u00a0mm collected in 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128 matrix. \n\nThe  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET results were evaluated by two nuclear medicine physicians blinded to the clinical diagnosis of the patients. Changes of  F\u2010FDG metabolism in regions of interest, including cerebrum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, and thalamus, were analyzed using visual inspection and SPM methods. For SPM methods, the data were converted from DICOM file into Analyze 7 format. Then, the images were spatially transformed and analyzed with SPM2 running on MATLAB. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAnalyses were performed using SPSS 22. All values were presented as mean and standard deviation. Student   t   test was used to compare the difference between PD patients and MSA patients. Categorical data were compared with chi square. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Clinical characteristics \u2010tremor, bradykinesia, cerebellar ataxic gait \n  \nFirst of all, in terms of clinical characteristics, the clinical data of 30 PD patients, 22 MSA\u2010P patients, and 28 MSA\u2010C patients are shown in Table\u00a0 . Patient age, gender, and disease duration did not differ significantly among the three groups. However, we found that significant difference between the PD group and the MSA group (MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C) in disease severity (UPDRS motor score, MSA\u2010P 26.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.60 MSA\u2010C 24.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.06 versus PD 17.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.98;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05, and H\u2010Y stage, MSA\u2010P 2.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63 MSA\u2010C 2.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60 versus PD 1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.72;   p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). \n\nWe further identified the clinical symptoms and signs for differentiating these diseases. Tremor or bradykinesia was the initial feature in all PD patients and the majority (86.4%) of MSA\u2010P patients, but in only one (3.6%) of 28 MSA\u2010C patients. Though tremor predominated in PD patients, bradykinesia occurred more frequently in MSA\u2010P (Table\u00a0 ). In contrast, the majority (53.6%) of MSA\u2010C patients presented an initial symptom of postural instability, which did not occur in PD and MSA\u2010C patients (Table\u00a0 ). At least one of the motor symptoms including tremor at rest, postural tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability developed at latest follow\u2010up in all the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients (Table\u00a0 ). Compared with the PD group, tremor at rest occurred less frequently, and postural instability was more frequently in MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C group (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.003). Parkinsonism symptoms such as tremor at rest, rigidity, and bradykinesia were less common in MSA\u2010C patients than those in PD patients (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). There was no significant difference in rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural tremor between PD group and MSA\u2010P group. In addition, other symptoms were present in MSA group, but not in PD group. Fall and Pisa sign occurred in 2 (9.09%) of 22 MSA\u2010P patients, and cerebellar ataxic gait, limb ataxia, and dysarthria were present in 25 (89.3%), 24 (85.7%), and 8 (28.6%) of 28 MSA\u2010C patients, respectively. \n  \nSymptoms and signs at onset of the patients \n      \nThe Parkinson's symptoms in the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups \n    \nCompared with PD patients, parkinsonian signs in MSA patients were more frequently symmetric. Only 24% of MSA patients had a good response to levodopa (375\u2013750\u00a0mg/day) and the response did not last for more than one year. In addition, autonomic dysfunction was present in 80% of MSA patients, but was in only 13.3% of PD patients (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05). Dementia occurred in 6% of MSA patients. \n\n\n### MRI findings\u2010Cerebellum, basal ganglia \n  \nThen, we used MRI to do research and found that MRI images showed different signal change among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups in infratentorial parameters (cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign), and supratentorial parameters (signal decrease in the basal ganglia, putaminal hyperintensive rim, and cortical atrophy) (Table\u00a0 ). Putaminal hyperintensive rim was significantly prominent in the MSA\u2010P group, compared with the PD group and the MSA\u2010C group (Figure\u00a0 ). There was no significant difference in other parameters between PD and MSA\u2010P groups. Infratentorial parameters were more common in MSA\u2010C groups than those in PD and MSA\u2010P groups (Figure\u00a0 ). Among the infratentorial parameters, cerebellar atrophy was most frequently found in the MSA\u2010C patients. However, signal decrease in the basal ganglia and cortical atrophy were not significantly different among these three groups (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nMRI signal change in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups \n      \nMRI images showing bilateral putamen atrophy and putaminal hyperintensive rim in one MSA\u2010P patient \n    \nMRI images showing atrophy in the cerebellum and brainstem, \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign in T WI, enlargement of the fourth ventricle, and mild atrophy in supratentorial structures \n  \n\n### F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging \u2010 Cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, Cerebellum \n  \nIn order to further explore the differences among these diseases, we also used 18F\u2010FDG\u2010PET technology to study. In all patients, 20 PD patients (14 males, age 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7\u00a0years), 11 MSA\u2010P patients (5 males, age 67.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0years), 13 MSA\u2010C patients (6 males, age 59.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0years), and 44 normal controls (24 males, age 62.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8\u00a0years) underwent  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET studies. Patient age and gender were not significantly different among the four groups. The disease duration did not differ significantly among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups (  p  \u00a0<\u00a0.05; PD 30.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.1\u00a0months, MSA\u2010P 34.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.1\u00a0months, MSA\u2010C 27.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0months). \n\nFor visual inspection of  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images, we did not identify a significant different pattern of glucose metabolism between PD group and control group. A clear and symmetrical distribution of the radiotracer was found in the brain areas such as cerebrum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, lenticular nucleus, and thalamus. A reduction in radiotracer uptake in the basal ganglia and in the cerebellum was found in MSA\u2010P group and MSA\u2010C group, respectively. \n\nWe performed SPM analysis of the group differences in  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images among the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C groups. In the PD group, the hallmark of glucose metabolism was a decreased metabolism in parietal areas. 11 (55.0%) of 20 PD patients showed a bilateral reduction in glucose metabolism. Except one patient who showed a reduction in glucose metabolism only in bilateral parietal area, hypometabolic areas in these patients were also observed in parieto\u2010occipital, frontal, occipital, and temporal cortical areas in 3, 3, 2, and 2 PD patients, respectively. 3 patients showed parieto\u2010occipital reduction in glucose metabolism. In addition, 3 PD patients showed different metabolic patterns. One patient had a unilateral reduction in glucose metabolism in frontal lobe, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. 2 patients exhibited a decreased metabolism in right putamen and bilateral cerebellum. The glucose metabolism was not significantly different in 3 other PD patients compared with controls (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the PD group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the PD group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral middle temporal sulcus occipital, and right inferior temporal sulcus and superior occipital sulcus. The hallmark of glucose metabolism is a decreased metabolism in bilateral parietal lobe \n  \nA distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010P group was the presence of a global hypometabolism in bilateral putamen and caudate. This finding was found in 8 of 11 patients, and 3 of them also had a mild and local reduction in glucose metabolism in bilateral cerebellum. In addition, hypometabolic areas were also observed in bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital, and insular cortical areas (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the MSA\u2010P group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the MSA\u2010P group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral caudate nucleus, bilateral cingulated cortex, left putamen, left inferior parietal lobule and posterior central sulcus, and right superior temporal sulcus and anterior central sulcus. The distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010P group is the presence of a global hypometabolism in bilateral basal ganglia \n  \nThe glucose metabolism in the MSA\u2010C group is characterized by a marked bilateral reduction in cerebellum. All 13 patients had this distinct characteristics, and 8 (61.5%) of them also showed a hypometabolism in the middle cerebellar peduncle. In addition, hypometabolic areas were also observed in pons and oblongata, frontal area, parietal, and occipital area in 1, 5, and 2 of MSA\u2010C patients, respectively (Figure\u00a0 ). \n  \nF\u2010FDG\u2010PET images in the MSA\u2010C group. Images from SPM analysis showing that in the MSA\u2010C group, glucose metabolism was decreased in bilateral cerebellum and medulla oblongata, and bilateral parental and frontal lobe. The distinguishing feature of the MSA\u2010C group is the presence of a glucose hypometabolism in bilateral cerebellum \n  \n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, we seek to study the PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C, and to find possible discriminating patterns of clinical symptoms, MRI findings, and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging. We identify several main findings that reflected the difference among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. First, clinical data show that the predominant motor symptom was greatly different in that tremor at rest, bradykinesia, and postural instability predominates in PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C patients, respectively. Second, MRI findings indicate that putaminal atrophy and hyperintensive rim (T WI) are characteristic features in MSA\u2010P, and cerebellar atrophy, \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign, and signal increase in the middle cerebellar peduncle are more prominent in MSA\u2010C. Third, the  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images demonstrate that a reduction in glucose metabolism occurs in parietal area for PD, in bilateral putamen for MSA\u2010P, and in bilateral cerebellum for MSA\u2010C. This study identifies the characteristic features of clinic symptoms, MRI abnormality, and glucose metabolism on  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET, which are indispensable for differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\nThe clinical presentation, MRI findings, and PET images in our study consistently reflect the pathophysiology of these diseases. It is known that the pathology of MSA\u2010P predominates in the basal ganglia, while the pathology of MSA\u2010C predominates in the cerebellum (Ozawa et al.,\u00a0 ). Bradykinesia is a hallmark of basal ganglia disorders and appears to correlate with the degree of dopamine deficiency (Berardelli, Rothwell, Thompson, & Hallett,\u00a0 ; Vingerhoets, Schulzer, Calne, & Snow,\u00a0 ). It has been reported that the decreased uptake of F\u2010fluorodopa is proportional to the degree of bradykinesia (Lozza, Marie, & Baron,  ; Niccolini & Politis,\u00a0 ). Our finding that putaminal hyperintensive rim in MRI and a reduction in glucose metabolism in  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET agree with bradykinesia as the dominant clinical feature in MSA\u2010P group. In contrast, cerebellar signs such as ataxic gait, limb ataxia, and postural instability are more frequently present in MSA\u2010C patients. This clinical feature is supported by the characteristic features on MRI and  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET images showing predominant cerebellar lesions. In addition, at the similar disease duration, MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C patients exhibit more severity in motor dysfunction with higher UPDRS and H\u2010Y scores than PD patients, supporting the fact that MSA develops more rapidly than PD (Laurens et al.,\u00a0 ). \n\nPutaminal hyperintensive rim in the MRI (T WI) occurs most frequently in MSA\u2010P patients compared with PD and MSA\u2010C patients. However, hyperintensive rim occurs in only 31.8% of MSA\u2010P patients and is also present in 2 (6.7%) of PD patients. The low sensitivity disfavors hyperintensive rim as a useful parameter for distinguishing MSA\u2010P from PD as previously reported (Hughes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The specificity of hyperintensive rim in this study is different from a previous report, which demonstrated that hyperintensive rim showed a highest specificity (90%) in MSA\u2010P patients (Hughes et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). This difference may result from different patients with variant clinical features and disease stage as well as different imaging conditions between the two studies. In addition, hyperintensive rim is not present in our MSA\u2010C patients with average disease duration of about 3\u00a0years. It is reported that hyperintensive rim occurs early in MSA\u2010P patient (less than 3\u00a0years) and late in MSA\u2010C patient (more than 4\u00a0years) (Pradhan & Tandon,\u00a0 ). Therefore, the presence of hyperintensive rim on MRI may be a good sign to exclude the diagnosis of MSA\u2010C, especially at the early stage of the disease. \n\nInfratentorial parameters in MRI such as cerebellar atrophy, signal increase in middle cerebellar peduncle, and \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign show a higher specificity in MSA\u2010C patients, and are useful for differentiation of MSA\u2010C from PD and MSA\u2010P patients. \u201cHot cross bun\u201d sign exhibits the highest specificity in MSA\u2010C patients and is not found in MSA\u2010P patients. This result agrees with previous study that \u201chot cross bun\u201d sign was observed later than putaminal hyperintensive rim in MSA\u2010P (Pradhan & Tandon,\u00a0 ). However, signal increase in middle cerebellar peduncle occurs only in 28.6% of MSA\u2010C patients, suggesting that it is not a sensitive parameter for early diagnosis of MSA\u2010C. \n\nIn order to further explore the differences between these diseases, we also used  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET for research which detects the change of regional glucose metabolism has been used for differential diagnose of PD from MSA (Grimaldi et al.,\u00a0 ; Kwon et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Meles, Teune, de Jong, Dierckx, & Leenders,  ; Meyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ; Ping, Benshu, & Shuo,\u00a0 ; Tom\u0161e et al.,\u00a0 ), since glucose metabolism at resting state is an effective marker for density and activity of synapse, which can reflect the neurodegenerative states of parkinsonian diseases. The glucose metabolism is not decreased in the basal ganglia in the majority of our PD patients with average disease duration of <3\u00a0years, suggesting that the basal ganglia are not seriously affected at the early stage of PD. However, glucose hypometabolism was found mainly in the parietal areas in our PD patients with no sign of dementia. This finding agrees with a previous report that the glucose metabolism was decreased in the parietal and parieto\u2010occipital regions in nondemented Parkinson's patients (Albrecht, Ballarini, Neumann, & Schroeter,\u00a0 ). It may be related to the regulation of Nigra striatum dopaminergic pathway in substantia nigra striatum of early Parkinson's disease. In addition, only one patient in MSA\u2010P and MSA\u2010C patients exhibits a hypometablosm in parietal area, suggesting that it is a good parameter for differentiation of PD from MSA. However, since 3 PD patients did not exhibit any difference in glucose metabolism from controls, the absence of glucose hypometabolism cannot exclude the diagnosis of PD. However, clinical diagnosis of PD is confirmed correctly by 76% of postmortem cases (Rajput et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). At present, the diagnosis of early PD is mainly based on clinical symptoms, and there is no specific manifestation of head MRI in the early stage. In this study, 11/20 patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease had bilateral parietal hypometabolism, and another 3/20 patients had hypometabolism in the parieto\u2010occipital syndesmosis area, which was not high, possibly due to the following reasons: (a) In this study, the duration of Parkinson's disease was 42.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.11\u00a0months, which was relatively short. Perhaps, the typical manifestations would gradually appear in patients with Parkinson's disease over time; (b) 3/20 patients had hypometabolism in the occipitoparietal junction area, and the clinical manifestations and FDG\u2010PET manifestations should be dynamically observed to further determine the diagnosis of PD. (c) One patient had a unilateral reduction in glucose metabolism in frontal lobe, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. 2 patients exhibited a decreased metabolism in right putamen and bilateral cerebellum. The presence or absence of Parkinson's superimposition in these three patients should be further diagnosed by dynamic observation of PDG\u2010PET changes. (d) The glucose metabolism was not significantly different in 3 other PD patients compared with controls. Whether PDG\u2010PET changes of PD or MSA will occur gradually with the progression of the disease should be followed up. These findings suggest that the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be a dynamic process, and perhaps early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease patients will continue to revise the diagnosis as the disease progresses. \n\nOur study also shows that glucose hypometabolism mainly occurs in bilateral putamen for MSA\u2010P patients and in cerebellum for MSA\u2010C patients. This characteristic of PET image is consistent with neuropathologic feature of MSA\u2010P (predominated in basal ganglia) and MSA\u2010C (predominated in cerebellum) (Ozawa et\u00a0al.,\u00a0 ). The reduction in glucose metabolism in bilateral putamen on PET occurs in 72.7% of MSA\u2010P patients and only in 2 (10.0%) of 20 PD patients, suggesting that it has a good parameter for differential diagnosis of MSA\u2010P and PD. In addition, this finding also suggests that hypometabolism in putamen on PET (72.7%) is more sensitive than the hyperintensive rim in MRI (31.8%) for diagnosis of MSA\u2010P. Furthermore, the hypometabolism in cerebellum shows the highest specificity in diagnosis of MSA\u2010C, since this feature is present in all MSA\u2010C patients, but not in PD patients. Since 3 MSA\u2010P patients also show a reduction in glucose metabolism in cerebellum, suggesting that cerebellar injury may occur very early in certain patients. Some studies suggest that glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) are present in the cortex of MSA patients, especially in the early frontal and parietal lobes (Papp & Lantos,\u00a0 ). Our study found that besides the decrease of subtentorial structural metabolism, there was a decrease of cerebral cortical glucose metabolism in the early stage of MSA. It was also observed that cognitive dysfunction in MSA patients was mainly manifested in poor vocabulary memory and executive function (Burk, Daum, & Rub,\u00a0 ), which was the manifestation of prefrontal lobe damage, consistent with the manifestation of frontal lobe involvement in PET. In this study, the average duration of the disease was less than 3\u00a0years, and further observation of clinical symptoms and the development of PET should be conducted to understand the cortical damage. \n\n### Limitation \n  \nThere are some limitations in this study. For example, the sample size of this study is not very large. Also, the evaluation indicators need to be further expanded to better understand the differential diagnosis among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nIn summary, we identify the characteristic features of PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C in clinical feature, MRI findings, and PET images. The differences among PD, MSA\u2010P, and MSA\u2010C are consistent with the pathological differences of these diseases, and thus appears to be useful for differential diagnosis among them. In the early stage of the disease, the clinical symptoms and signs are atypical, and the positive rate of MRI imaging is not high, which often brings difficulties to the diagnosis.  F\u2010FDG\u2010PET imaging can find more typical disease signs, which is a better differential diagnosis method. \n\n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST \n  \nAll authors have contributed significantly to the manuscript and declare that the work is original and has not been submitted or published elsewhere.

These results may broaden the understanding of the potential mechanism of cognitive impairments in early PD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCognitive impairment is a serious and common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), which has received increasing attention in recent years. It can occur at different stages of PD, even at the time of PD diagnosis (Williams-Gray et al.,  ). In patients newly diagnosed with PD, the frequency of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was approximately 20\u201340% (Yarnall et al.,  ; Aarsland et al.,  ). Early MCI is an important risk factor for dementia. The manifestations of cognitive decline in PD can be highly heterogeneous. Dysfunction in various cognitive domains has been reported in the early stages of PD before overt dementia, such as executive functions, memory, attention, visuospatial performance, and language (Yarnall et al.,  ; Aarsland et al.,  ). A previous study suggested that deficits in specific cognitive functions imposed different degrees of risk for developing dementia (Pagonabarraga and Kulisevsky,  ). However, the potential brain mechanisms of dysfunction in the processes of diverse cognitive functions remain to be fully studied. \n\nSeveral MRI studies have explored brain structural and functional network changes related to cognitive performance in PD patients. Widespread gray matter atrophy or white matter damage was observed in PD patients with relatively long disease duration (Melzer et al.,  ; Agosta et al.,  ). A few studies based on structural MRI further suggested that differences in regional brain volume may contribute to between-patient cognitive heterogeneity in PD (Gerrits et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ). However, in the early stages of PD, structural changes were always limited and subtle. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies indicated that functional alternations in widely distributed brain networks, such as the frontoparietal network, cortico-striatal circuits, default mode network (DMN), were associated with overall cognitive decline in patients with PD (Monchi et al.,  ; Tessitore et al.,  ; D\u00edez-Cirarda et al.,  ; Hou et al.,  ). Most of the previous fMRI studies investigated functional changes in   a priori   seed regions or subnetworks. Moreover, to our knowledge, the neuroanatomic basis of dysfunction in some specific cognitive processes was shown to be different between PD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Lee et al.,  ). The key brain nodes or networks related to deficits in various cognitive functions in early PD remained to be illuminated. Therefore, a broader and more integrated brain network beyond the known focal regions or subnetworks needs to be investigated. \n\nAs a data-driven approach, graph theory-based methods have been increasingly proposed for the analysis of brain MRI data and became a powerful tool for exploring alterations in brain functional and structural networks. Brain networks are described as graphs composed of nodes (anatomic brain regions) linked by edges (i.e., functional connections). To our knowledge, only a few studies used graph theory-based methods to evaluate cognitive impairment in PD patients (Baggio et al.,  ). In the present study, we focus on a special type of graph theory-based method that identifies nodes playing central roles within the brain network. Such nodes are characterized by a measure called \u201ccentrality\u201d. Eigenvector centrality (EC) measures the sum of centralities of a node\u2019s direct neighbors by assessing both the number and the quality of connections, making it sensitive to different layers in the network hierarchy (Lohmann et al.,  ; Wink et al.,  ). EC mapping (ECM) attributes a value of each voxel in the whole brain, therefore, it can objectively detect all the important brain regions that have greater connections with other parts of the brain. Unlike seed-based analysis or Independent Component Analysis (ICA), EC considers the brain as one large network rather than several subnetworks, so it is independent of   a priori   knowledge and free of researcher selection bias. ECM has proven valuable in investigating various nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), major depressive disorder, and nicotine dependence (Binnewijzend et al.,  ; Song et al.,  ; Shen et al.,  ). \n\nIn the present study, we aimed to investigate the alterations of functional connections that were associated with the performance of multiple cognitive functions over the entire brain in early PD patients by using EC as a mapping tool. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nData used in this article were obtained from the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database . PPMI is an observational, multi-center study that has been collecting a large variety of clinical, imaging data and biologic samples to identify more biomarkers of PD progression. This research protocol was approved by local Institutional Review Boards of all the participating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Major inclusion criteria of early PD subjects were as follows: (1) at least two of the following symptoms: resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity or either asymmetric resting tremor or asymmetric bradykinesia; (2) Hoehn and Yahr stage I or II; (3) age 30 years or older; and (4) dopamine transporter deficit suggested by dopamine transporter SPECT scan. Exclusion criteria mainly included atypical PD syndromes and any medical or psychiatric condition or lab abnormality, which might preclude participation. \n\n\n### Neuropsychological Assessments \n  \nParticipants underwent a series of cognitive tests evaluating various cognitive functions, including: (1) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) as a measure of verbal memory; (2) Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (BJLO) test for assessing visuospatial function; (3) Semantic Fluency test mainly for reflecting executive function; (4) WMS-III Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) test as a measure of working memory; and (5) Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) for assessing attention function. \n\n\n### Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nBoth structural and rest-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data were downloaded from the PPMI database. A standard MR scan was performed using a Siemens 3T TIM Trio scanner. The structural images were obtained using a 3D MPRAGE with GRAPPA T1-weighted sequence: sagittal orientation; repetition time (TR) = 2,300 ms; echo time (TE) = 2.98 ms; inversion time (TI) = 900 ms; flip angle (FA) = 9\u00b0; Field of View  = 240 \u00d7 256 mm ; voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm . The rsfMRI images were acquired using an echo-planar imaging sequence with following parameters: 185 EPI volumes, with 40 ascending slices each; TR = 2,400 ms; TE = 25 ms; flip angle = 80\u00b0; slice thickness = 3.3 mm; FOV = 222 \u00d7 222 mm ; voxel size = 3.3 \u00d7 3.3 \u00d7 3.3 mm . \n\n\n### Imaging Preprocessing \n  \nImage data were preprocessed with the Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging , based on the Statistical Parameter Mapping software (SPM 8 ). The first 10 volumes were discarded from the analysis. The remaining rsfMRI images were used for the following procedures: slice timing correction (using middle slice as a reference) and realignment to correct head motion, nuisance covariates regression (Friston 24 parameters, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid signal), normalization to the standard space and resampling into a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm  voxel size, spatially smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM), temporal band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1 Hz), detrending and scrubbing. Subjects were excluded if the head motion was exceeding 2 mm (displacement in the x, y, or z directions) or 2\u00b0 (angular motion). \n\n\n### ECM \n  \nECM of the pre-processed rsfMRI image data was performed using fast ECM (fECM) software  (Wink et al.,  ). EC measures the sum of centralities of the node\u2019s direct neighbors, which are produced by calculating linear correlations between the fMRI time series and estimating eigenvector at each iteration. Biologically, EC can reflect the global functional importance of each voxel in the brain and has been shown to compare favorably to other centrality measures (Joyce et al.,  ). A node with a higher EC value means greater connectedness with the rest part of the brain. Compared to traditional ECM calculation methods, the time and memory required for the fECM algorithm are very small, because it computes the matrix-vector products directly from the data, without explicitly storing the connectivity matrix. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nDemographic continuous data and neuropsychological scores were expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations. For imaging data, the correlations between eigenvector centralities of different brain regions and neuropsychological scores were identified by linear correlation analysis performed in SPM8, age and sex as covariates. For the multiple comparison correction, Gaussian random field (voxel-level   P   < 0.001, cluster level   P   < 0.05) was employed. To further control the type I error, the Bonferroni method was further conducted in the multi-cognitive scale level. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOne-hundred and one early stage PD patients had rsfMRI data. Seventeen patients were excluded due to imaging quality (including predominant head motion or scans that had not covered the whole brain). Finally, 84 subjects were included for further analysis. In the included patients, two participants were lack of SDMT scores. The detailed demographic data and neuropsychological assessment scores were listed in  . \n  \nDemographic and neuropsychological data of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients. \n  \n Values are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviations or numbers of subjects. UPDRS, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale; H-Y stage: Hoehn and Yahr stage; HVLT-R, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; BJLO, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test; LNS, WMS-III Letter Number Sequencing test; SF, Semantic Fluency test; SDMT, Symbol Digit Modalities Test. *SDMT scores were calculated from 82 patients  . \n  \nECM analysis showed that EC values in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and lingual gyrus were positively correlated with the scores of the LNS test ( ,  ). The immediate recall scores of HVLT-R were positively correlated with EC in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG;  ,  ). However, no significant correlations were detected between the scores of other cognitive assessments (delayed recall, retention, and recognition of HVLT-R, BJLO, SF, and SDMT) and the EC values. \n  \nThe Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) scores were positively correlated with eigenvector centrality (EC) in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and lingual gyrus. \n    \nEigenvector centrality (EC) of brain areas showing significant correlations with neuropsychological scores. \n    \nThe immediate recall scores of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) were positively correlated with EC in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG). \n  \nAfter controlling the type I error at the multi-cognitive scale level, no significant correlation between EC values and cognitive scores was observed. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we investigated the relationship between the performance of multiple cognitive tests and the eigenvector centrality of the whole brain. The major findings were as follows: (1) performance of working memory (LNS scores) in early PD was positively associated with EC in the left inferior occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus; and (2) EC in the left superior frontal gyrus was associated with immediate recall scores for memory in early PD patients. These results suggested that in the early stage of PD, subtle alternations in different cognitive aspects could be reflected by the disruptions of functional connectivity using ECM. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study using the ECM method to evaluate the whole brain network connectivity correlated with cognitive functions in the early stage PD patients. There were only a few studies that used ECM to investigate the underlying functional network alternations associated with motor and other nonmotor symptoms (e.g., depression, dysphagia) in PD patients (Holiga et al.,  ; Lou et al.,  ; Mueller et al.,  ; de Schipper et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ). In a study by de Schipper et al. ( ), decreased EC was shown in the occipital and frontal lobes in PD patients, which indicated diminished connectivity of these regions within the overall brain functional architecture in PD. \n\nThe Letter-Number Sequencing Test is a measure of verbal working memory. Working memory, which refers to the ability to flexibly maintain and manipulate information for a short period, is generally considered a core component of executive function (Matthews,  ). Our study showed a positive correlation between the LNS scores with the EC in the left occipital lobe (inferior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus), which might imply an important role of these brain regions in the working memory performance in the early PD. There was growing evidence suggesting the posterior parts of the brain, including the occipital lobe, as the key pathophysiologic regions in cognitive impairment in PD. A positron emission tomography (PET) study showed decreased metabolism in the occipito-parietal cortex was associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD (Bohnen et al.,  ). Several MRI studies showed structural atrophy (Pagonabarraga et al.,  ; Garcia-Diaz et al.,  ; Pereira et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ; Xuan et al.,  ) and functional disruption (Olde Dubbelink et al.,  ; Fang et al.,  ; Kawabata et al.,  ) in the occipital lobe in PD patients, which might contribute to impairment in multiple cognitive functions in PD (Pagonabarraga et al.,  ; Garcia-Diaz et al.,  ; Pereira et al.,  ). Disrupted functional connectivity of the occipital region was also reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suggesting a shared profile of functional changes in the cognitive disorders (Galvin et al.,  ). Conventionally, the cortical substrate for working memory/executive function tasks was predominantly attributed to the frontal region. However, working memory/executive function consisted of complex cognitive processes, and depended on distributed neural systems containing multiple brain regions (Petrides,  ). Therefore, the term working memory is not necessarily equated with frontal function. In a task fMRI study, Ekman et al. ( ) found a significant activity decrease in the fusiform gyrus (a region adjacent to the lingual gyrus) during a verbal working-memory task between baseline and follow-up in PD with MCI, indicating that the fusiform gyrus could be responsible for the longitudinal changes of working-memory maintenance in PD patients. Similar to our results, Lee et al. ( ) found that the performance of executive function task significantly correlated with occipital gray matter volume in early non-demented PD patients, rather than with the expected frontal region. The mechanisms of relationship between changes in the occipital lobe and cognitive decline in PD still need further investigation. Molecular imaging studies suggested that the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic fibers projecting to the posterior parts seemed to be an important cause for PD cognitive progression (Roy et al.,  ). \n\nAnother finding in our study was the positive correlation between EC of left SFG and immediate recall scores for memory. Previous studies showed the structural and functional changes of the frontal lobe in the early stages of PD, especially SFG and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). In a recent meta-analysis of structural studies in PD, left SFG was among the brain regions with the most significant regional gray matter volume reductions (Xu et al.,  ). Generally, the temporal lobe is considered critical to the memory process, particularly episodic memory formation. However, damage in areas interconnected to the temporal lobe may also lead to memory impairment (Matthews,  ). The frontal cortex receives inputs from all association areas including the ventral temporal lobe and limbic system (Ceccarini et al.,  ). Therefore, it also takes an important part in memory, mainly in encoding and retrieval functions. Lebedev et al. ( ) investigated rsfMRI correlate of cognitive impairment in PD patients from a large-scale network perspective. The result showed that better memory performance correlated with increased prefrontal-limbic processing. In a rsfMRI study of rigidity-dominant PD, memory scores were positively correlated with the functional connectivity between the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and bilateral SFG (Hou et al.,  ). The neurotransmitter basis underlying changes of frontal areas in PD was thought to be related to depleted dopaminergic circuitry. However, more and more non-dopaminergic mechanisms, such as cholinergic, serotonergic and endocannabinoid systems (Cho et al.,  ; Ceccarini et al.,  ), were reported to participate in the frontal dysfunction, which might be responsible for declines in cognitive performance in early stage of PD. Moreover, we observed a dissociation in the EC correlation with different memory subtests. A previous structural study also showed that the immediate recall scores, but not the delayed recall scores, correlated with cortical thickness in PD patients (Pereira et al.,  ). It was in keeping with the finding that memory dysfunction in early PD patients to a large degree was a deficit of immediate recall (encoding), but not of retrieval or retention (Br\u00f8nnick et al.,  ). \n\nIn our present study, there was no significant correlation between the performance of other cognitive assessments (BJLO, SF, and SDMT) with EC. This might be partly due to PD patients in the current study being in an early disease stage with an only subtle decline in these cognitive functions. It is worth noting that the observed relationships between EC and working memory and immediate recall memory performance did not survive after Bonferroni adjustment in the multi-cognitive scale level. Probably, the relatively small sample size and only a few features taken into analysis in the present study might be the reason, and on other hand, the risk of high type II error might occur. As stated by historical document, the balance between type I and type II error should be paid attention to, instead of strictly controlling type I error, because type I error could be gradually eliminated when the scientific issues were widely answered and replicated by other researchers(Lieberman and Cunningham,  ). Taken together, our explorative study, demonstrating the preliminary but important evidence for the potential coupling between brain EC alterations and neuropsychological behaviors, should help understand brain function topology during a cognitive performance in early PD patients. \n\nSeveral limitations of our study should be recognized and further discussed. First, we did not include normal controls in the recent study. In the PPMI project, rsfMRI scanning was conducted at some selected sites. Therefore, only a small population of normal controls had rsfMRI images in the PPMI study (  n   = 22). Second, the neurological scales used in our study were not comprehensive enough. For example, we did not assess the language function because of the lack of specific language tests in the PPMI. Meanwhile, there are various aspects of executive functioning and memory, but our cognitive batteries only involved some specific components. Furthermore, we did not conduct a longitudinal study of fMRI data and cognitive performance. Future longitudinal studies with a larger population and combining multiple imaging modalities should be conducted to confirm our findings. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, our study indicates that early brain functional alternations may account for the performance of different cognitive functions in early PD patients by using ECM analysis. The left occipital lobe (inferior occipital and lingual gyrus) is related to the performance of working memory. While the left superior frontal gyrus may contribute to a deficit in immediate recall of memory. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets presented in this study are included in the article. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by ethics committee on human experimentation of each participating PPMI site ( ).

Our objective was to determine if changes in the thalami could be non-invasively detected in structural MRI images obtained from subjects with Parkinson disease (PD), compared to age-matched controls. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nNo significant differences in volume were detected in the thalami between eighteen normal subjects and eighteen PD subjects groups. However significant (p < 0.03) shape differences were detected between the Left vs. Right thalami in PD, between the left thalami in PD and controls, and between the right thalami in PD and controls using a recently-developed, spherical harmonic-based representation. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nSystematic changes in thalamic shape can be non-invasively assessed in PD in vivo. Shape changes, in addition to volume changes, may represent a new avenue to assess the progress of neurodegenerative processes. Although not directly discernable at the resolution of standard MRI, previous pathological studies would suggest that the shape changes detected in this study represent degeneration in the centre median-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex, an area known to represent selective non-dopaminergic degeneration in PD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe thalamic changes seen in Parkinson Disease (PD) may represent selective non-dopaminergic degeneration [ ], as there is selective neuronal loss in the centre median-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex in Parkinson's disease [ ], yet relative preservation of neurons in the limbic (mediodorsal and anterior principal) thalamic nuclei. Henderson et al. examined the thalamic intranuclear nuclei in 10 normal controls and 9 patients with PD [ ]. As expected, they found   \u03b1  -synuclein-positive Lewy bodies in these nuclei in the thalamus, but they also found a significant reduction (40\u201355%) in the total neuronal number in the caudal intralaminar (CM-Pf) nuclei, regions that receive glutaminergic innervation [ ]. This contrasted with the 70% loss of pigmented nigral neurons. A factor analysis has demonstrated that the size of neurons in the motor cortex is negatively correlated with the size and number of neurons in its thalamic relay, the VLp. There is also a positive correlation between the number of ventral anterior (VA) neurons and the pre-supplementary motor area (SMA) [ ]. \n\nBacci et al. suggested that CM-Pf degeneration may partially counteract the consequences of dopamine neuronal loss, as thalamic and dopamine inputs have antagonistic influence on neurotransmitter-related gene expression [ ]. Moreover, the CM-Pf degeneration may be a direct consequence of nigrostriatal denervation, as depleting the striatum of dopamine results in the remaining Pf neurons being particularly hyperactive [ ]. \n\nThe normal role of the CM-Pf complex is incompletely understood, although it is clearly related to basal ganglia function [ ]. The Pf nuclei receive input from the spinal cord and project to the striatum [ ]. These projections may carry specific temporally-patterned inputs to striatal targets [ ]. While the CM-Pf complex has traditionally been considered part of the reticulo-thalamo-cortical activating system, a recent proposal suggests that the CM-Pf complex participates in sensory driven attentional processes, particularly unexpected events [ ]. \n\nThe advent of modern imaging techniques has allowed the noninvasive   in vivo   assessment of brain structures, such as the thalamus, in disease states. Thalamic morphological changes have been detected chronically after cortical injury, such as middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction after 1 yr [ , ] and tumor resection after ~2 yrs [ ]. The study by Hulshoff Pol [ ] detected a 5% decrease in ipsilateral thalamus and, interestingly, a 4.5% increase in contralateral thalamic volume after unilateral tumor resection, presumably on the basis of a compensatory mechanism. \n\nIn PD and related disorders, some studies of structural and functional imaging have detected thalamic changes. Thalamic grey matter changes have been detected contralateral to unilateral Parkinsonian resting tremor [ ]. In PD with dementia, the thalamus, in addition to the hippocampus and anterior cingulate, represent the regions most affected [ ]. Functionally, there is a connection between a major component in F-DOPA uptake in the striatum and a component from fluoro-deoxy \u2013 glucose (FDG), which had positive loadings in the thalamus and the cerebellum [ ]. \n\nMost morphological studies based on imaging involve a number of steps manipulating the brain images. A typical approach would be to warp (\"spatially normalize\") the brain images to a common space [ ]. Further smoothing of the data (e.g. using an isotropic 12 mm Gaussian kernel) to minimize the effects of misregistration between different normalized brains may affect the ability to make inferences about small, subcortical structures like the thalamus. In fact this \"Voxel Based Morphometry\" approach has thus been a controversial approach (e.g., see discussions in [ ] and [ ]). \n\nRecent approaches try to reduce errors due to misregistration by aligning the subjects at the region of interest (ROI) level, as opposed to the whole brain level [ - ]. However, these approaches are designed to deal with a different problem, namely that of summarizing fMRI activation from several subjects. To quantify differences in morphology, it would be necessary to examine the different transformations required to warp each subject's ROIs to the examplar ROI shape \u2013 a non-trivial task. \n\nAn alternative approach to warping brains to the same space is to segment brain structures individually on unmanipulated (i.e. unregistered and unwarped) brains [ ]. Because no registration of the brain images is done, this requires summarizing the individual brain structures in a way that they are invariant to positioning of the head in the scanner. For example, simply estimating the volume of an ROI such as the thalamus has this property, as it is invariant to the individual coordinate frame used. A number of such invariants (e.g. spatial variance) have been proposed to summarize the shape of brain structures [ ], or even characterize the distribution (texture) of activation maps in fMRI [ ]. \n\nWe have recently proposed a method based on spherical harmonics (SPHARM) which provided a unique representation of brain structures, including regions with possible topological disconnections, such as the lateral ventricles [ ]. In brief, the method involves first finding a spherical shell which encompasses the entire ROI. Subsequent smaller concentric shells are then derived and the intersection between the progressively smaller spherical shells and the brain structure is computed (Figure  ). The results from the intersections are then combined into a unique feature vector containing approximately 100's or 1000's of elements. This feature vector provides a unique representation of the shape which is independent of the spatial orientation of the structure (see Methods). \n  \n The SPHARM-based method for shape determination  . The shape to be specified (the thalamus) and two concentric spherical shells are shown. On the right is the intersection between the thalamus and shells as a function of rotation (  \u03b8  ) and azimuth (\u25a1). The rotation angle spans from 0 to 2  \u03c0   radians, and the azimuth angle is from 0 to   \u03c0   radians. \n  \nWe examined the thalami from 18 PD subjects and 18 age-matched controls. Using the above technique, we found significant differences between the two groups in the shape of the thalami, but not in the volume. This suggests that significant thalamic changes can be assessed noninvasively in PD, suitable for longitudinal studies. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThere were no significant differences in volume between sides in either controls or PD subjects, nor between controls and PD subjects in either the left or right thalamus (Table  ). In contrast, the SPHARM-based method found significant shape differences between the left and right thalamus in PD but not in controls. Significant shape differences between PD and controls were detected in both the left and right thalami. \n  \nResults of volumetric and shape analysis. Numbers indicate the p-values obtained from the permutation test. \n  \nFor PD subjects, an ANOVA examining the influences on the distance metric (Eqn 8) of acquisition site, side of symptoms or duration (F(1,20) = 1.9, p = 0.18; F(1,20) = 1.59, p = 0.22; F(17,20) = 1.35, p = 0.26; respectively). As all PD subjects were right handed, handedness could not be tested in this group. Similarly, an ANOVA on the distance metric for all subjects examining site of acquisition (F(1,72) = 0.14, p = 0.71) or handedness (F(1,72) = 0.16, p = 0.69) did not find factors of significance with a fixed effects model. \n\nIn order to better visualize and intuitively assess the shape differences in thalami between PD subjects and controls, we took thalami that had \"typical\" feature vectors (i.e. feature vectors closest to the mean of each group) and assumed that they represented exemplar shapes. We then spatially aligned these exemplar shapes (Figure  ). There appeared to be greater differences in the left thalami between controls and PD subjects. The largest differences appeared to be along the dorsal surface. Note that the registration of the thalami in this instance was solely for visualization purposes and was not incorporated into the analysis. \n  \n Two sets typical thalami registered and shown on brain from a PD subject  . Note that the registration here is solely for visualization purposes, and is not required for the calculation of shape differences. Also, although the thalami here were first smoothed with a 12 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel for visualization purposes, no smoothing was performed for the shape analysis and group comparison. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nIt is well known that changes in the thalamus can be seen chronically after cortical injury [ , ]. This is not only due to direct effects of axonal damage, as axonal-sparing cortical lesions also result in thalamic degeneration [ ]. Such thalamic degeneration probably involves both anterograde and retrograde processes [ ] and may be mitigated by growth factors [ , ]. Brain development has a critical role on the extent of thalamic changes after a cortical lesion. Animal models have determined that perinatal lesions are far less likely to induce thalamic changes, compared to when the cortical lesions are made prenatally [ ] or in adulthood [ ]. In contrast to the secondary effects of thalamic changes from cortical lesions, the thalamic changes in PD are related to selective non-dopaminergic neurodegeneration [ ]. \n\nConsistent with prior results, we found no significant differences in the volume of the thalami between PD subjects and controls [ ]. However, for the first time, we have demonstrated that the   shape   of the thalami undergoes systematic changes in PD. The reason that shape may change but not the volume may be due to the fact that particular nuclei (e.g CM-Pf) are involved, and thus, at the typical resolution of MRI, this does not result in significant changes in the overall volume. Alternately, since thalamic volume may actually increase as a compensatory mechanism [ ], other regions of the thalamus may hypertrophy. \n\nThe ability to non-invasively quantify subtle morphological shape changes appears to be a powerful technique. We utilized standard structural MR imaging techniques without any special sequences nor any special scanner resolution requirements. We obtained robust results from pooling data from two different centres using two different types of scanners. \n\nWe used manual segmentation of the thalami in this paper. Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures is an area of ongoing research [ ], and often requires the tuning of many parameters, especially when the images may be pooled from scanners from different centres. Since the person at each centre doing the segmentation was blinded to disease status, it would be unexpected that a systematic bias was introduced into our results. Even then, any misspecification of the same ROI across subjects would tend to increase inter-subject variability and presumably reduce discriminability across groups making the task harder for the shape analysis approach. \n\nWe used SPHARM-based invariant descriptors to quantify the shape of the thalami. The main advantages of such a method is that it does not require that all brain images be warped to a common space, nor does it require that the brain images be aligned in any way. A drawback of these invariant features approach is that it is difficult to invert the feature vectors, i.e. once given all the values of the different invariants, it is impossible to reconstruct the original image which gave that feature vector \u2013 analogous to the fact that given the volume of an object, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct the original shape. We therefore cannot create a \"typical\" brain structure by averaging the feature vectors and create the image that would give this feature vector (e.g. to create an \"average left thalamus\"). However, it is possible to cluster structures in the feature space and find the brain structure whose feature vector is in the middle of the cluster so as to use it as an exemplar shape, which we have done (Figure  ). \n\nIt is difficult to determine if the shape differences we detected are attributable to any specific nuclei. However, based on prior pathological studies, it would be likely that the differences we detected were related to degeneration in the CM-Pf complex. Given that progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) has even greater involvement of VLp than PD [ ], it remains to be seen if thalamic shape is a discriminable feature between these two conditions. \n\nWe did not detect any association between overall shape change and handedness, and dominant side presentations or presence/absence of tremor. This may be due to the relatively small sample size employed in this study. However, because the feature vectors consist of many different components, we don't discount that there may be a subset of components that are sensitive to these disease parameters. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur results suggest that systematic changes in thalamic shape can be non-invasively assessed in PD in vivo and that shape changes, in addition to volume changes, may represent a new avenue to assess the progress of neurodegenerative processes. Although we cannot state which parts of the thalamus are directly affected, previous pathological studies would suggest that the shape changes detected in this study represent degeneration in the centre median-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex, an area known to represent selective non-dopaminergic degeneration in PD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards and Ethics Boards of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the University of North Carolina (UNC). All structural data were obtained as part of fMRI studies whose results are reported elsewhere (e.g., [ ]). \n\n### MR Imaging at the University of British Columbia \n  \nAll subjects gave written informed consent prior to participating. Nine volunteers with clinically diagnosed PD participated in the study (5 men, 4 women, mean age 68.1 \u00b1 6.8 years, 7 right-handed, 2 left-handed). All subjects had mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2\u20133) [ ] with mean symptom duration of 3.6 \u00b1 2.6 years. We recruited ten healthy, age-matched control subjects without active neurological disorders (3 men, 7 women, mean age 55 \u00b1 12.4 years, 9 right-handed, 1 left-handed). Exclusion criteria included atypical Parkinsonism, presence of other neurological or psychiatric conditions and use of antidepressants, sleeping tablets, or dopamine blocking agents. \n\nMRI was conducted on a Philips Achieva 3.0 T scanner (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with a 6 channel Sense head-coil. A high resolution, three dimensional (3D) SPGR image data set of the whole brain consisting of 170 axial slices at a FOV of 256 \u00d7 200 mm was acquired for WM/GM segmentation purposes and as anatomical reference (inversion prepared 3D T1TFE, TR = 7.746 ms, TE = 3.55 ms, inversion delay = 880 ms, flip angle = 8.00\u00b0, voxel dimensions 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm ). \n\nThe thalami were one of eighteen specific regions of interest (ROIs) that were manually drawn on each unwarped, aligned structural scan using the Amira software (Mercury Computer Systems, San Diego, USA). Although the thalami were manually segmented on the axial slices, they were carefully examined in the coronal and saggital planes to ensure accuracy. The trained technician performing the segmentation was blinded to the disease state. \n\n\n### MR Imaging at the University of North Carolina \n  \nAll subjects gave written informed consent prior to participating. Nine volunteers with clinically diagnosed mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2\u20133 \u2013 mean symptom duration of 2.1 \u00b1 2.0 years) participated in the study (5 men, 4 women, mean age 58 \u00b1 12 yrs, all right-handed). We also recruited eight healthy, age-matched control subjects without active neurological disorders (5 men, 3 women, mean age 49 \u00b1 14 yrs, 8 right-handed). Images were acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a birdcage-type standard quadrature head coil and an advanced nuclear magnetic resonance echoplanar system. The head was positioned along the canthomeatal line. Foam padding was used to limit head motion. High-resolution T1 weighted anatomical images were acquired (3D SPGR, TR = 14 ms, TE = 7.7 ms, flip angle = 25\u00b0, voxel dimensions 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm, 176 \u00d7 256 voxels, 160 slices). \n\nROIs (including thalami) were drawn manually by the same trained research associate with assistance from multiple on-line and published atlases (e.g. [ ]). \n\n\n### Thalami Shape Analysis \n  \nAs described in the technical appendix, the analysis of each shape results in a unique feature vector, of length   n   = 1440. The left and right thalami were analyzed separately. \n\nFor comparison, we examined for any differences in volume. The volume of each thalamus was estimated as the number of voxels that each ROI contained multiplied by the volume of a single voxel. \n\nTo assess the significance of group differences between feature vectors, we used a permutation test to generate a null distribution of Euclidean distances between feature vectors. The permutation test does not require a priori assumptions about the data distribution, and is thus preferred over T-test and F-test [ ]. We assessed the differences in left vs. right thalami in controls, left vs. right in PD subjects, PD vs. controls for the left thalamus, and PD vs. controls for the right thalamus. Although the boundaries of the thalami were determined by visual inspection, in prior work we compared feature vectors derived from thalami segmented from structural scans obtained before and after giving L-dopa medication (as part of another fMRI study) [ ]. As expected, no significant differences could be detected in the two groups, suggesting that independent manual segmentation did not incur significant systematic errors. \n\n\n### Shape Analysis \u2013 technical aspects \n  \nLet \u03a8(  \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ) be a function defined on the unit spherewith   \u03b8   and   \u03c6   as the zenithal and azimuthal angles, respectively. The SPHARM representation for this function is given by (1) where   is the complex conjugate of the   m  order spherical harmonic of degree   l  .   l   ranges from 0 to   L   [ ]. Increasing the value of   L  , also called the bandwidth, improves the representation accuracy at the cost of higher computation time. This definition can also be extended to real valued 3D distributions \u03a8(  r  ,   \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ) (2), where   r   is the distance from the origin to a given voxel.   k   is an index introduced to account for possible degeneracy due to the additional dimension [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs explained later in this section, rotationally invariant features can be derived from this spherical harmonic representation. In our application, we also need the features to be invariant to any translation of the entire ROI in 3D space. To achieve this, we move the origin of the function \u03a8(  r  ,   \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ), to the centroid of \u03a8 (  r  ,   \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ), where \u03a8 (  r  ,   \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ) is given by (3). \n\n\n\nSince direct computation of (2) is highly inefficient [ ], we use an alternate approach by representing the data as a set of spherical functions obtained by intersecting the 3D data with spherical shells. Alternatively, for each value of   r  , \u03a8(  r  ,   \u03b8  ,   \u03c6  ) can be visualized as a spherical shell comprising the function values at a distance   r   from the origin.   r   can then be incremented in steps of   t   to encompass the entire ROI. If the initial representation of the function is in the form of a cubic grid (regular isotropic voxels in our case), volumetric interpolation is required to resample the ROI in the spherical coordinate space. \n\nWhen analyzing multiple subjects' ROIs simultaneously, we define the maximum radius,   R  , as the minimum radial distance in voxel count that encompasses all non-zero values of all subjects' ROIs being analyzed. To represent the values from the cubic grid of all ROIs with sufficient accuracy,   2R  shells are used. To achieve scale invariance, the shells must be distributed evenly throughout the spatial extent of each ROI. Since the ROI size across subjects is not uniform, shell spacing   t   must be adjusted for each subject separately. This procedure ensures that each shell captures similar features from the 3D ROI irrespective of its scale. \n\nSurface sampling along each of these shells is performed on an equiangular spherical grid of dimensions   2L   \u00d7   2L   [ ]. The common bandwidth   L   for all shells of all functions is chosen to satisfy the sampling criterion for the largest shell in this set of ROI, namely the one with radius   R  . The surface area for this shell represents the maximum surface shell area that needs to be sampled by the equiangular grid; hence, any value of   L   satisfying the required equiangular sampling (  2L   \u00d7   2L  ) at this shell will be sufficient to represent data from smaller radii shells. The minimum value for   L   is obtained by equating the surface area of this largest shell to the equiangular sampling grid (4). Higher values of L are not used, since it increase computation time with no added benefit. Also, this will result in longer feature vectors, complicating the analysis. Furthermore, when the represented object is a discrete array, higher values of   l  , resulting from a larger   L  , may correspond to sampling noise [ ]. Recognizing that in applications pertaining to discrimination, high accuracy in the SPHARM representation is not a necessity, we chose to use the minimum value for   L   as that obtained by (4). \n\n\n\nTo obtain the SPHARM representation for all shells, a discrete SPHARM transform is performed at each value of   r   to obtain   (5). Features derived from this representation, however, do not provide a unique function representation [ , ]. For instance, rotating the inner and outer shells by different amount will result in different spatial distribution of function values. However, in this approach, the derived features are insensitive to these rotational transforms, thus resulting in the same feature values for dissimilar spatial distributions. \n\n\n\nBurel and Henocq's original equation (2) does not have this problem, since a part of the basis function is a function of   r  . However, since (2) is computationally intractable [ ], we proposed an efficient approach that uses a radial transform (6), derived from (2), to obtain a unique function representation. The transform (6) retains the relative orientation information of the shells, thus the features derived will be sensitive to independent rotations of the different shells, thereby ensuring that   unique   feature representation is obtained. \n\n\n\nThe range of   k   could be changed to obtain different lengths of the final feature vector. However, to avoid unnecessarily increasing the feature vector length or losing any important information caused by reducing the range, we choose to keep the range of   k   the same as that of   r  , i.e. 2  R  . \n\nFrom the obtained representation (6), we then compute similarity transform invariant features using (7) for each value of   l   and   k   [ ] with   p   and   q   are used to index these features. Note we reshape   I   into a single row vector of dimensions   D   =   L   \u00d7 2  R  for later analysis. \n\n\n\nIn order to provide a scalar estimate how different a given thalamus shape was, we calculated the mean of the row vectors, I (Eqn 7) separately for both the left and right thalami. A distance metric, estimating how \"abnormal\" a given shape was estimated by determining the Euclidean distance between the given feature vector and the mean vector. For example, the distance for right thalamus for the   j  subject was estimated as: \n\n\n\n\n\n## Competing interests \n  \nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. \n\n\n## Authors' contributions \n  \nMJM conceptualized the study, supervised the collection of the data from UBC, and supervised the application of the SPHARM technique to medical data.

However, the pathological mechanism underlying PD-RBD remains unclear. We aim to use the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to explore the mechanism of PD-RBD from the perspective of internal connectivity networks. \n\n Materials and Methods:   A total of 92 PD patients and 20 age and sex matched normal controls (NC) were included. All participants underwent rs-fMRI scan and clinical assessment. According to the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ), PD patients were divided into two groups: PD with probable RBD (PD-pRBD) and PD without probable RBD (PD-npRBD). The whole brain was divided into 90 regions using automated anatomic labeling atlas. Functional network of each subject was constructed according to the correlation of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level dependent signals in any two brain regions and network metrics were analyzed using graph theory approaches. Network properties among three groups were compared and correlation analysis was made using distinguishing network metrics and RBDSQ scores. \n\n Results:   We found both PD-pRBD and PD-npRBD patients existed small-world characteristics. PD-pRBD showed a wider range of nodal property changes in neocortex and limbic system than PD-npRBD patients when compared with NC. Besides, PD-pRBD showed significant enhanced nodal efficiency in the bilateral thalamus and betweenness centrality in the left insula, but, reduced betweenness centrality in the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus when compared with PD-npRBD. Moreover, nodal efficiency in the bilateral thalamus were positively correlated with RBDSQ scores. \n\n Conclusions:   Both NC and PD patients displayed small-world properties and indiscriminate global measure but PD-pRBD showed more extensive changes of nodal properties than PD-npRBD. The increased centrality role in the bilateral thalamus and the left insula, and disruption in the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus may play as a key role in underlying pathogenesis of PD-RBD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is an abnormal state of sleep, characterized by lost muscle atonia and abnormal dream acting behavior. It is thought to have a strong correlation with \u03b1-synucleinopathies, especially Parkinson disease (PD) ( ,  ). It can occur either before or after the onset of typical motor symptoms of PD ( ). Compared to PD patients without RBD (PD-nRBD), PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD) are more likely to have psychiatric disease, more severe autonomic dysfunction, motor manifestation, and cognitive impairment ( ,  ). This indicates that PD-RBD tends to be a special disease phenotype, which means more serious pathology of Lewy bodies and clinical characteristics. However, we still know very little about the pathogenesis of RBD in PD. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and convenient technique, which is widely used to explore the pathogenesis of central nervous system diseases. Some researchers successively explored structure changes in PD-RBD patients using voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging and structural correlation network methods. They found PD-RBD has decreased volume in more or less cortical and subcortical structures such as thalamus, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex ( \u2013 ). In addition to brain structure, a few researchers also used the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to search changes of brain function in PD-RBD. Gallea found PD-RBD showed decreased functional connectivity between pedunculopontine nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex ( ). And Li found PD-RBD had decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in primary motor cortex and premotor cortex ( ). Nevertheless, recent studies tend to regard neurodegenerative process as network-based neurodegeneration rather than only based on isolated regions ( ). We must not only focus on the dysfunction of key brain regions, but also consider the collective effects between various brain regions and systemic overall-level disorders. \n\nSuitably, the fMRI-based graph theory analysis allows the brain to be studied as a complex network, and it can reflect dynamic interactions between different brain regions by describing and analyzing the local and global characteristics of a graph composed of nodes and edges ( ). This technique has been used to detect abnormal communication in the brain. Suo found the configurations of brain functional network in PD were perturbed and correlated with the severity of the disease ( ). And another study found idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients had reduced centrality in left superior parietal lobule when compared with healthy controls ( ). However, the mechanism of overall brain functional network regulation and property changes in PD-RBD patients is still unknown. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the underlying mechanism of PD patients with probable RBD (PD-pRBD) from the perspective of functional network regulation. We propose a hypothesis that PD-pRBD patients have characteristic brain functional network features and topological changes. Therefore, we construct a brain functional network of PD-pRBD patients using graph theory analysis to describe the characteristics of the brain network and explore its relationship with RBD symptom in PD patients. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants and Clinical Evaluation \n  \nThe rs-fMRI data of PD patients and normal controls were from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database ( ). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and all PPMI sites was approved by their respective ethics committee. PD patients and NC were both divided into two groups according to the RBD screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) scores. A score of \u22656 of RBDSQ was considered as probable RBD (pRBD) in the present study ( ). NC with pRBD were excluded. For an independent subject, we usually selected the baseline data, unless poor image quality, the follow-up data were selected. Then, 68 PD-npRBD patients, 32 PD-pRBD patients, and 20 NC were initially contained. Participants' neuropsychological performance was measured across a variety of cognitive tests. Verbal memory was assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT). Verbal fluency was assessed by the Semantic Fluency Test (SF). Processing speed was assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Visuospatial ability was assessed by the Benton Judgement of Line Orientation Test (BJLO). Executive function was assessed by the Letter-Number Sequencing Test (LNS). Motor function was evaluated using Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part three (MDS-UPDRS-III) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage. \n\n\n### FMRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing \n  \nAll fMRI images were acquired on 3.0 T Siemens scanners (Erlangen, Germany) at different centers using the ep2d_RESTING_STATE sequence. The acquisition parameters were as follows: repetition time = 2,400 ms; echo time = 25 ms; flip angle = 80\u00b0; voxel size = 3.3 mm ; slice thickness = 3.3 mm; and each brain volume comprised 40 axial slices and one functional run contained 210 brain volumes. The fMRI images were preprocessed using DIPABI software ( ). The steps were as follows: removal of the first 10 volumes, slice timing, realignment, spatial normalization through EPI templates, smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 full width at half maximum, linear detrending, the regression of nuisance and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.1 Hz). Finally, after ruling out poor-quality images, 62 PD-npRBD patients, 30 PD-pRBD patients, and 20 NC were retained to final analysis. \n\n\n### Construction of Network \n  \nThe network was constructed using GRETNA ( ). First, the whole brain was divided into 90 cortical and subcortical regions of interest by using the automated anatomic labeling atlas with each region representing a network node. Next, to define the edges of the network, we acquired the mean time series of each region and calculated the Pearson correlations of the mean time series between all pairs of nodes. This resulted in a 90  90 Pearson correlation matrix for each participant. The matrix was binary according to a predefined threshold, if the Pearson correlation coefficient between any two regions exceeds the threshold, there will be an edge between that two regions ( ). \n\n\n### Network Analysis \n  \nWe applied a sparsity threshold (0.05\u20130.5, with an interval of 0.05) to all correlation matrices. For the brain network at each sparsity level, we calculated both global and nodal network properties and the area under the curve (AUC) for each property over the sparsity range. The global properties include small-world, network efficiency, assortativity, synchronization and hierarchy. The nodal properties include nodal clustering coefficient, nodal shortest path length, nodal efficiency, nodal local efficiency, nodal degree centrality and nodal betweenness centrality. \n\nSmall-world properties indicate that the information segmentation and integration achieve a balance maximizing the efficiency of information transfer with a relatively low wiring cost. Network efficiency measures the global efficiency of parallel information transfer in a network. Assortativity reflects the connection trend of nodes which have similar numbers of edges. Synchronization measures the possibility all nodes fluctuate in the same wave pattern. The hierarchy coefficient reflects the presence of a hierarchical organization of network ( ). \n\nThe clustering coefficient of a node measures the possibility its neighbor interconnect. The nodal local efficiency measures the communication efficiency among its first neighbors when the node is removed. The shortest path length and efficiency of a given node quantifies the efficiency of parallel information transfer of that node in the network. The degree centrality and betweenness centrality of a given node reflects its importance on information transfer ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe analyses of demographic and clinical data and global network properties were performed with SPSS version 25.0. Continuous variables were compared use one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with pairwise   t  -test (with Bonferroni correction) or Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA with pairwise Mann -Whitney   U   Test (with Bonferroni correction) according to its distribution. Categorical variables were compared use Chi-square statistics. We choose   P   < 0.05(two-tailed) to indicate that the difference was statistically significant. \n\nThe analysis of the AUC of nodal network properties was performed using general linear model with age, gender, and head motion as nuisance covariates. For multiple comparisons of nodal network properties, we use false-positive correction [  P   = 1/90 (1/  N  ) = 0.01,   N   means 90 compared nodes in total, which implies that the expected average false positive rate is <1 in each analysis] ( \u2013 ), and use Bonferroni correction to adjust the   p  -value when comparing the nodal network properties in the general linear model among three groups (PD-pRBD, PD-npRBD, and NC). \n\nFinally, Spearman correlations were analyzed to examine relationships between networks properties with significant group effects and clinical characteristics with significant group effects (RBDSQ scores). We did correlation analysis cross the whole patient group (PD-pRBD and PD-npRBD). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and Clinical Characteristic \n  \nDemographic and clinical data of 62 PD-npRBD patients, 30 PD-pRBD patients, and 20 NC were presented in  . There was no significant difference except RBDSQ scores between PD-pRBD and PD-npRBD groups (  p   < 0.001). The education years of NC were higher than two PD patient groups (  p   < 0.001). The MDS-UPDRS-III score of NC were lower than PD groups (  p   < 0.001). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of PD patients and controls. \n  \n Data shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (quartiles 25\u201375%) when appropriate.

This indicated that typical small-world characteristic existed among NC, PD-npRBD, and PD-pRBD patients. There was no significant difference among three groups of small-world characteristics (aGamma, aLambda, aSigma) (  p   > 0.05). \n  \nThe small-world properties of brain functional network.

PD-pRBD showed increased nodal measures in frontal lobe (left olfactory,   p   = 0.006), limbic lobe(right post cingulum,   p   = 0.005; left hippocampus,   p   = 0.003), and sub cortical gray nuclei (left and right thalamus,   p   = 0.004,   p   = 0.006) for nodal efficiency; in frontal lobe (left olfactory,   p   = 0.009), limbic lobe (right post cingulum,   p   = 0.005; left hippocampus,   p   = 0.003), and sub cortical gray nuclei (left caudate,   p   = 0.005; left thalamus,   p   = 0.009) for nodal degree centrality; in frontal lobe (left olfactory,   p   = 0.004) and parietal lobe (left inferior parietal gyrus,   p   = 0.008) for nodal betweenness centrality. PD-npRBD showed increased nodal measures in frontal lobe (right middle frontal gyrus,   p   = 0.004) for betweenness centrality when compared with NC ( ). \n  \nComparisons of regional network measures.

The results were visualized using the BrainNet Viewer (Beijing Normal University,  ). NC, normal controls; PD-npRBD, PD patients without probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; PD-pRBD, PD patients with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. \n  \nAlso, when compared with NC, PD-pRBD had wider regions with decreased nodal measures than PD-npRBD. PD-pRBD showed decreased nodal clustering coefficient in frontal lobe (right middle frontal gyrus,   p   = 0.007) and parietal lobe (right superior parietal gyrus,   p   = 0.003), decreased nodal efficiency in occipital lobe (left inferior occipital gyrus,   p   = 0.008), decreased nodal local efficiency in parietal lobe (right superior parietal gyrus,   p   = 0.006), decreased nodal degree centrality in occipital lobe (bilateral inferior occipital gyrus,   p   = 0.003,   p   = 0.006). PD-npRBD showed decreased nodal clustering coefficient and local efficiency in right middle frontal gyrus (  p   = 0.001,   p   = 0.006) ( ). \n\n\n#### Comparisons Between PD-npRBD and PD-pRBD \n  \nWhen comparing with PD-npRBD, PD-pRBD showed increased nodal efficiency in the bilateral thalamus (  p   = 0.007,   p   = 0.006) and increased betweenness centrality in the left insula (  p   = 0.006), as well as decreased betweenness centrality in the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (  p   = 0.004) ( ,  ). \n  \nViolin plot of different regional network measures between two groups of PD.

There are two principal findings in the present study. Firstly, the functional networks of both PD groups (PD-pRBD and PD-npRBD) retained small-world properties and global function. Secondly, PD-pRBD had wider nodal parameter changes than PD-npRBD when compared with NC, the efficiency of the bilateral thalamus and the betweenness centrality of the left insula were increased and the betweenness centrality of the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus was decreased in PD-pRBD patients when compared with PD-npRBD patients. And the bilateral thalamus efficiency was positively correlated with RBDSQ scores. \n\n### Small-World Properties and Global Measure of PD and NC \n  \nSmall-world properties indicate that the information segmentation and integration achieve a balance maximizing the efficiency of information transfer with a relatively low wiring cost. Our study found PD patients and NC exhibited typical features of the small-world, and there was no significant difference in small-world properties and global measure among three groups. This was consistent with previous studies ( ,  ,  ,  ). That is to say, the information of brain can be integrated effectively in both PD patients and NC. And the global network properties of PD patients and NC were similar. However, there were also some studies that showed different results from ours. For example, Suo found the clustering coefficient and global efficiency of PD patients was decreased, and the local efficiency and characteristic path length was increased when compared to NC ( ). Luo found the PD group showed lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency than NC ( ). The discrepancy of these results may be due to the difference of severity of PD patients, parameters of image acquisition, method of processing, and the heterogeneity of PD patients. \n\n\n### Altered Nodal Measure in PD-pRBD Compared With NC \n  \nIn this study, we found PD-pRBD patients showed extensive changes of nodal measure when compared with NC. The nodes whose network property were increased mainly located in left olfactory, left inferior parietal gyrus, right post cingulum, left hippocampus, bilateral thalamus, left caudate. And the nodes whose network property were decreased mainly located in right middle frontal gyrus, right superior parietal gyrus, bilateral inferior occipital gyrus. These nuclei were often mentioned in studies about PD or PD-RBD patients. A fMRI study comparing functional network of PD and NC reported the degree was decreased in occipital gyrus and increased in inferior parietal gyrus, post cingulum ( ). Another similar study about PD patients also reported decreased node centralities and connectivity strength in occipital regions ( ). Moreover, some PET studies about iRBD reported increased metabolism in thalamus and hippocampus, decreased metabolism in occipital lobe ( ,  ). This may indicate that the decreased occipital function and increased function of limbic system and sub cortical gray nuclei play an important role in the development of PD and RBD. As for the entorhinal cortex, some studies reported that olfactory impairment was a marker of RBD and PD ( ). Pathological studies about PD-RBD also reported accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in entorhinal cortex ( ). So, the increase of network property in left olfactory may be a kind of compensation. \n\n\n### Decreased Betweenness Centrality of Right Dorsolateral Superior Frontal Gyrus (PD-pRBD vs. PD-npRBD) \n  \nAlthough both PD-pRBD and PD-npRBD patients kept the small-world properties and normal global communication function, we found PD-pRBD had a wider range of nodal properties changes than PD-npRBD patients, especially in the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (SFGdl). We found PD-pRBD had decreased betweenness centrality in the SFGdl when compared with PD-npRBD (  p   = 0.0036,   t   = \u22122.99). The SFGdl is located in the upper prefrontal cortex and forms the frontoparietal network. The frontoparietal network is considered to be a flexible cognitive control center, which regulates and integrates high-level emotions and consciousness ( ). PD-pRBD patients have a characteristic decentralization of the SFGdl, which may weaken the frontoparietal network function and reduce the ability of emotional and cognition regulation. There were some studies presented that PD patients with RBD tend to perform worse in cognitive test ( ,  ,  ). Therefore, some scholars believe that the characteristic decentralization of SFGdl in PD-pRBD patients may be related to the decline in cognitive regulation. However, our study did not find a significant decline in cognitive function in the PD-pRBD patients. This may be because the sample size was insufficient to cause significant changes in clinical cognition performance in our study. Of course, the functional impairments we observed in PD-pRBD patients may just reflects the nature of RBD itself associating with neurodegeneration rather than worse cognitive performance as reported in iRBD patients ( ). The association of the SFGdl and RBD needs more studies with large sample size to validate. \n\n\n### Increased Efficiency of Bilateral Thalamus (PD-pRBD vs. PD-npRBD) \n  \nThalamus is a small structure within the brain located just above the midbrain between cerebral cortex and brain stem and has extensive nerve connections to both. The main function of the thalamus is to relay motor and sensory signals to the cerebral cortex. It also regulates sleep and wakefulness. Some previous morphometry studies showed markedly reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral thalamus of PD-pRBD patients in comparison with PD-npRBD patients and the volume of thalamus is negatively correlated with RBDSQ scores ( ,  ,  ). And some previous functional studies also reported changes of thalamus function. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have reported increased metabolism in thalamus of iRBD ( ,  ). A fMRI study reported that resting-state thalamo-occipital functional connectivity was increased in iRBD patients ( ). And a pathologic study reported that PD patients with sleep disorder showed more severe \u03b1-synuclein pathology in thalamus ( ). Combined with our findings that efficiency of the bilateral thalamus was increased in PD-pRBD and correlated positively with RBDSQ scores, we speculate that increased thalamus efficiency is the compensation for the reduced thalamus volume and more severe pathology to maintain normal function of brain global information transfer. The number of studies exploring changes of PD-RBD functional connectivity was small. Future studies could focus on functional connectivity of thalamus and the combination of volume changes in PD-RBD patients. \n\n\n### Increased Betweenness Centrality of Left Insula (PD-pRBD vs. PD-npRBD) \n  \nThe cortical limbic system related to controlling emotions is considered to be involved in RBD, as the behaviors observed in RBD are violent and the recalled dreams are unhappy and fearful ( ). The insular cortex is considered as limbic-related cortex. The insula is well-situated for the integration of information relating to bodily states into higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. It receives information from \u201chomeostatic afferent\u201d sensory pathways through the thalamus and sends output to some other limbic-related structures, such as the amygdala and ventral striatum ( ). A study focused on structural correlation network reported that the nodal betweenness and degree of limbic system was increased ( ). And a PET study of iRBD reported increased metabolism in hippocampus. These results suggest that the function of the limbic system was increased in RBD patients. This is consistent with our results. In addition, some previous studies found that compared with PD-npRBD, PD-pRBD patients showed reduced volume of the left insula ( ). Other studies reported a decrease in the volume of other limbic systems such as the left posterior cingulate and hippocampal gray matter ( ). And a pathologic study reported that PD patients with sleep disorder showed more severe \u03b1-synuclein pathology in limbic system than those without sleep disorder ( ). Based on these results, we speculate that the increased betweenness centrality of the left insula is compensatory to volume decrease and pathological involvement to maintain the overall information conversion efficiency of the brain. However, some studies based on morphometry did not find any significant difference in limbic system ( ,  ,  ). The difference may be due to the size of the sample and the severity of the patient's symptoms. In the future, it is necessary to study large samples and combine multi-modal images. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations in this study. First, we used the RBDSQ score to group PD patients rather than polysomnography. However, the RBDSQ score used to identify RBD have a high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (85%) ( ). Second, the cerebellum was not included as nodes because many images we downloaded did not coverage of the cerebellum completely. Future studies covering these regions are needed to further explore the topological structures for the brain networks of PD-RBD patients. Third, we carried out a cross-sectional study and the symptom of patients were relatively mild. In the future, longitudinal follow-up studies and patients with more severe symptoms should be included to help us further understand the pathogenies of PD-RBD. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nBoth NC and PD patients displayed small-world properties and indiscriminate global measure but PD-pRBD showed more extensive changes of nodal properties than PD-npRBD. The increased centrality role in the bilateral thalamus and the left insula, and disruption in the right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus may play as a key role in underlying pathogenesis of PD-RBD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Parkinson's progression markers initiative ethics committee.

In Parkinson disease (PD) patients, NM concentration decreases gradually with degeneration and necrosis of dopamine neurons, suggesting potential use as a PD biomarker. We aimed to evaluate associations between NM concentration in in vivo SN and PD progression and different motor subtypes using NM magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI). Fifty-four patients with idiopathic PD were enrolled. Patients were divided into groups by subtypes with different clinical symptoms: tremor dominant (TD) group and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) group. Fifteen healthy age-matched volunteers were enrolled as controls. All subjects underwent clinical assessment and NM-MRI examination. PD patients showed significantly decreased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values in medial and lateral SN (  P  \u2009<\u20090.05) compared to controls. CNR values in lateral SN region decreased linearly with PD progression (  P  \u2009=\u20090.001). PIGD patients showed significant decreases in CNR mean values in lateral SN compared to TD patients (  P  \u2009=\u20090.004). Diagnostic accuracy of using lateral substantia nigra (SN) in TD and PIGD groups was 79% (sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 78.6%). NM concentration in PD patients decreases gradually during disease progression and differs significantly between PD subtypes. NM may be a reliable biomarker for PD severity and subtype identification. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, its pathological changes mainly focus on the dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin (NM) lost in the subatantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and both noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons containing NM lost in the locus coeruleus (Hirsch et al.  ; Gibb  ; Kastner et al. ; Zarow et al.  ). NM is a special dark polymer pigment, it mainly exist in the SNc and other catecholaminergic neurons. It has shown that NM is an important factor in promoting dopaminergic neurons degeneration in Parkinson disease (Hirsch et al.  ; Kastner et al.  ; Zecca et al.  ). The mechanism may be that NM derived from dying neurons can activate microglia to release cytoactive factors, inducing the accumulation of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which can bind antigen and presenting on the membrane of the NM contained neurons, and then CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells recognize and target these neurons, inducing neurodegeneration (Cerbrian et al.  ). Pathological studies have shown that the degeneration of NM neurons occurs earlier than clinical symptoms appeared in PD patients, and it was exponentially lost with a 45% loss in the first decade of onset, and the number of NM in substantia nigra of PD patients after death is less than that 50% of the healthy control group (Fearnley and Lees  ; Zecca et al.  ). Therefore, NM may participate in the occurrence and development of PD through contribute to neuronal death, and become one of the pathogenic factors of PD. Sasaki et al. invented high-resolution spin-echo T1-weighted neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI), which revolutionized the visualization of neurons in the substantia nigra (Sasaki et al.  ). Using high-resolution spin-echo T1-weighted NM magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) can make the neurons with NM in the brain show high signal area to reflect the signal intensity and distribution of NM (Sulzer\u00a0D et al.  ). The loss of high signal area can be detected by NM-MRI in the early stage of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, we can clarify the progress of PD by noninvasive monitoring the attenuation degree of NM signal, and make NM become an in vivo biomarker reflecting the severity of PD (Cassidy et al.  ). \n\nParkinson disease is a highly heterogeneous. Due to the lack of a unified classification standard, PD patients are often classified by clinical features into tremor dominant (TD) subtype and postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype (Stebbins et al.  ). The clinical manifestations of the two subtypes were significantly different. Compared with patients with TD subtype, patients with PIGD subtype showed more severe symptoms, faster disease progression, higher depression tendency and more severe cognitive impairment (Konno et al.  ; Dissanayaka et al.  ). At present, the difference of neural mechanism between the two subtypes is not clear. The difference of NM concentration between different subtypes of PD detected by NM-MRI is helpful to deepen the understanding of the pathogenesis of these two subtypes and improve the efficacy of clinical intervention. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance for the treatment and prognosis of PD patients to strengthen the research on the neural mechanism of PD subtypes. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the concentration of NM and the progression of PD, and to explore the difference of NM signal intensity between the two subtypes of PD, so as to verify the feasibility of NM as a biomarker for identifying PD progression and subtypes. \n\n\n## Subjects and methods \n  \n### Subjects and grouping \n  \n#### PD groups \n  \nA total of 54 patients with idiopathic PD were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis by an experienced neurologist according to the Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson disease developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) in 2015 (Postuma et al.  ). \n\nThe exclusion criteria were: (1) secondary parkinsonism caused by repeated episodes of cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis, drugs, poisoning, infections, traumatic brain injury, etc.; (2) Parkinson plus syndromes such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, etc.; (3) those with chronic wasting diseases, such as severe liver and renal diseases, cardiopulmonary disease, endocrine disease or malignant tumor; (4)patients with a history of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery; (5) those with claustrophobia, pacemaker implantation, or poor compliance. \n\n\n#### Scale scoring criteria \n  \nDisease severity was assessed using Parts II and III of the UPDRS scale and the H-Y stage when patients were in \u201coff\u201d periods (DaoKuan\u00a0Liu  ). In addition, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was adopted to assess patients\u2019 levels of cognitive function, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess for possible depressive symptoms. \n\n\n#### Motor typing standard \n  \nAccording to the grouping method developed by Stebbins et al. ( ), PD patients were divided into the TD group (  n  \u2009=\u200934), PIGD group (  n  \u2009=\u200914) and intermediate group (  n  \u2009=\u20096) according to the phenotype of their motor symptoms. The patients in the intermediate group were removed without further image acquisition and data analysis. \n\n\n#### Control group \n  \nAdditionally, this study enrolled a control group of 15 healthy age- and gender-matched volunteers who were in good health and had neither history of severe neurological/psychiatric disorders nor family history of neurological degeneration,and were evaluated by neurologists to rule out Parkinsonism. \n\n\n\n### Ethical considerations \n  \nThe Ethics Committee of our institution unanimously approved the protocol for this study, and all subjects provided signed informed consent to participate. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nAll NM-MRI images were obtained using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (Discovery\u2122 MR750, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The patients were fully informed of precautions before the examination, and they were asked to lie on the examination table in a supine position while keeping quiet and calm during the scan. Foam pads were placed on both sides of the head to prevent head movement. A T1-weighted fast spin-echo sequence was used to acquire the images. The specific parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 500/11\u00a0ms; echo train length (ETL) 1; number of excitations (NEX) 8; slice thickness 2.0\u00a0mm; slice gap: 0.4\u00a0mm; number of slices acquired 20; matrix size 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512; field of view 220\u00a0mm; and acquisition time 12\u00a0min. Twenty NM-MRI axial image slices parallel to the anterior\u2013posterior commissure line of the corpus callosum were obtained for each individual. In addition, all subjects\u2019 T1, T2, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were collected to exclude brain lesions that interfere with the experimental results. Note that the MRI images of PD patients were acquired in their relatively more energetic and mobile \u201con\u201d state. \n\n\n### Image processing \n  \nUsing image analysis software (Jim version 8.0, xinapse Systems, Colchester, United Kingdom;  ), three consecutive slices of high signal SN can be seen in the obtained axial image, the location and signal intensity distribution of the regions of interest (ROIs) were determined on the intermediate slice of SN according to the previous measurement methods (Schwarz et al.  ; Reim\u00e3o et al.  ). Image analysis software (Jim Version 8.0, Xinapse Systems, Colchester, United Kingdom;  ) was used to determine the location and signal intensity distribution of the regions of interest (ROIs) on a slice containing SN (Konno et al.  ). Then, the signal intensity of the ROIs, including the medial and lateral parts of the bilateral SN and cerebral peduncles (CP), were manually measured using the cursor on the display to obtain the average value after calculating the CNR values of the bilateral NM. Specifically, in the high-intensity medial and lateral parts of the bilateral SN, two circles with a radius of 2\u00a0mm were placed by a neurologist who was blinded to patient identity, and two circular ROIs with a radius of 3\u00a0mm were used as a control to determine the background signal of the CP (Fig.\u00a0 ). The measurements were performed three times to compute the average value for subsequent statistical analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the measured values of ROIs is 0.83\u20130.91, which has good intra-observer consistency. Ultimately, the CNR of SN signal intensity was calculated using the following formula: where SI  is the signal intensity of the ROIs manually measured in the SN, and SI  is the background signal intensity of the ROIs in the bilateral CPs (Xing et al.  ).   \nNM-MRI diagram of SN.   a   Healthy control group;   b   tremor dominant (TD);   c   group and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subgroup;   d   the circular region of interest for quantitative analysis is located in the lateral and medial parts of substantia nigra and left and right cerebral feet,   SN   substantia nigra pars,   CP   cerebral peduncles \n  \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nData of the TD, PIGD, and control groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify statistically significant differences in age and gender between groups. The TD and control groups, and the TD and PIGD groups were compared separately using the rank-sum test to identify statistically significant differences in CNR, progression, MMSE and HAMD scores, H\u2013Y stage, and UPDRS score between groups. Measurement data are expressed as median (quartile) [M (Q1, Q3)]. Partial correlation analysis was used to evaluate the statistical relationship between CNR measurements and course of disease of PD patients, and to correct for age and gender. Determine the intra-observer agreement by calculating the ICC value. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to represent significant differences. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was adopted to determine the CNR values of the lateral SN in the TD and PIGD groups, so as to compare their sensitivity and specificity. The critical value was determined using the Jordan index. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS Statistics software (SPSS for Windows, version 23.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (Xing et al.  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comparison of subjects\u2019 demographic and clinical data \n  \nNo significant differences were found in age (  P  \u2009=\u20090.782) and gender (  P  \u2009=\u20090.869) between the TD, PIGD, and control groups. Compared with the TD group, the PIGD group showed a significantly higher H\u2013Y stage and UPDRSIII score (  P  \u2009=\u20090.008, 0.017), but no significant differences were found between groups in the course of disease, MMSE scores, MocA scores, and HAMD scores (  P  \u2009=\u20090.150, 0.437, 0.639 and 0.768, respectively, Table  ).   \nGeneral clinical data of subjects \n  \n TD   tremor dominant,   PIGD   group and postural instability and gait difficulty,   H\u2013Y   Hoehn and Yahr,   UPDRS   unifified Parkinson disease rating scale,   MMSE   Mini-Mental State Examination,   HAMD   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale \n\n*  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n  \n\n\n### Comparison of CNR values in SN between PD and control groups \n  \nCompared with the control group, both PD groups showed decreased CNR values in the medial and lateral SN (  P  \u2009<\u20090.005, Table  ).   \nComparison of CNR value of substantia nigra between PD group and control group \n  \n CNR   contrast-to-noise ratio,   PD   Parkinson disease \n\n*  P  \u2009<\u20090.05 \n  \n\n\n### Associations between CNR values in the medial and lateral SN and PD course \n  \nWith the progression of PD, CNR values in the medial and lateral SN decreased linearly (  P  \u2009=\u20090.236, 0.008), particularly in the lateral part (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nScatter diagram of the relationship between CNR value of SN and duration of disease in PD patients.

(2) In PIGD patients, CNR mean values were significantly decreased compared to those in TD patients. H-Y stage and UPDRSIII scores were also significantly higher in the PIGD patients than those in the TD group. \n\nPD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose characteristic pathological changes include progressive loss of NM-containing dopaminergic neurons and formation of Lewy bodies in the SN of the midbrain (Ehringer and Hornykiewicz  ). The results of pathological anatomy showed that the loss rate of dopaminergic neurons in the SN of PD patients is proportional to the number of NM-containing cells therein, and that the loss rate of each NM-containing cell is positively associated with the amount of its melanin pigmentation. Therefore, there is a close clinicopathological correlation between NM and PD (Hirsch et al.  ;  ; Kastner et al.  ; Zucca et al.  ). In this study, NM-MRI results revealed that CNR values of NM were significantly lower than that of the healthy control group, which were consistent with previous research results (Reim\u00e3o et al.  ,  ; Ohtsuka et al.  ; Isaias et al.  ). Meanwhile, we further analyzed the correlation between NM and the course of PD, and concluded that with the progression of PD, the clinical symptoms of patients were gradually aggravated, and the CNR values of medial and lateral SN decreased, especially in the lateral part. This result was consistent with the previous pathological research results. Previous pathological results showed that during the first 10\u00a0years of Parkinson's disease, the loss of pigmented neurons was exponential, with the largest loss in the ventrolateral layer (91%), followed by the ventrolateral layer (71%) and the dorsal lateral layer (56%) (Schwarz et al.  ; Fearnley and Lees  ). Most previous results of NM-MRI research also found that the decrease of NM-MRI signal in PD subjects was more inclined to the lateral, posterior and ventral voxels of SN, and NM is negatively associated with PD severity indicators, such as disease course, Hoehn\u2013Yahr (H\u2013Y) stage, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score, but there are still a few studies showing no significant correlation (Cassidy et al.  ; Schwarz et al.  ; Reim\u00e3o et al.  ; Kashihara et al.  ; Fabbri et al.  ). This difference may be due to the application of different techniques in experimental data processing, which indicates that we still need to continue to explore the relationship between NM concentration and PD progression. \n\nOur results also showed that there was a significant difference in signal attenuation in substantia nigra between pigd and TD groups. The signal attenuation of SN in the PIGD group was more serious than that in the TD group, which may be attributed to the difference of the two subtypes in pathophysiological mechanism. Autopsy results showed that compared with pigd patients, TD patients had less loss of pigment cells in SN, and less Lewy small volume aggregation in cortex (Selikhova et al.  ). Therefore, it is speculated that the incidence of tremor is not closely associated with nigrostriatal pathway disorder, but instead it may result from the cerebellar\u2013thalamic\u2013cortical pathway. Therefore, the pigmented neurons containing NM in the substantia nigra of TD group had less degeneration and necrosis (Helmich et al.  ). Our results showed that the signal attenuation of lateral SN in PIGD group was more serious than that in TD group (AUC 79%, sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 78.6%). There was no significant difference in CNR between the two groups. However, a previous small sample imaging study found that the signal attenuation difference between the two subgroups was more significant in the medial part of SN (Yuanyuan Xiang et al.  ), while another NM-MRI study on de novo Parkinson disease showed no significant difference between the motor subgroups (Wang et al.  ). \n\nAs the sample size of this study is relatively small, and the classification of PD motor subtypes may change with the progress of the disease (Eisinger et al.  ), we need to follow-up the subjects for a longer time, and conduct a large sample longitudinal study to further clarify the difference of NM signal attenuation in substantia nigra between the two subgroups. Previous studies have shown that tremor is a feature of benign PD; compared with patients with bradykinesia and rigidity dominant PD, tremor dominant PD patients enter H\u2013Y 4 more slowly (Rajput et al.  ), have lower dementia and depression tendency (Vakil and Herishanu-Naaman  ; Lewis et al.  ; Williams-Gray et al.  ; Aarsland et al.  ; Williams-Gray et al.  ; Van Rooden et al.  ), Our results showed that the H\u2013Y stage and updrsiii score of pigd group were significantly higher than those of TD group, but MMSE and hamd-24 scores had no significant difference, which could be attributed to the small number of Parkinson's disease patients registered in this study. \n\nAs a non-traumatic resting state brain imaging technology, NM-MRI does not require subjects to perform tedious tasks or receive invasive stimulation, provides favorable operability, and can be used as a routine clinical application to assist PD diagnosis and disease follow-up. Recent studies have shown that the volume and CNR of PD patients\u2019 SN are positively associated with the dopamine transporter (DAT) density of its corresponding corpus striatum (Isaias et al.  ). Therefore, NM-MRI can be used to quantitatively study the pathology of SN in PD patients, especially considering its close association with the dopaminergic innervation of the human striatum in PD. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis study has some limitations, including its relatively small sample size and cross-sectional study design. Considering the instability of the subtypes of some PD patients, it is necessary for the study to replicate in a larger sample. Another small sample study with 14 PD patients detected longitudinal changes in their SN values using NM-MRI. In that study, follow-up of the PD patients found them to have a significantly smaller total area of SN and a lower CNR value than the initial NM-MRI values (Matsuura et al.  ). Therefore, it is feasible to consider NM-MRI as an indicator of PD progression. Furthermore, the motion artifacts during the acquisition of the NM-MRI sequence may have been generated by some TD patients and may have affected the sensitivity and specificity of the results. To confirm our results, additional prospective study with a larger sample and longitudinal exploration of the correlation between NM and PD severity is still needed. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nNM concentration in PD patients decreases gradually during disease progressionm with CMR values correlating linearly with the course of PD. In addition, PD patients in different subtypes demonstrate different rules of change for NM in the SN, NM may therefore be a reliable biomarker for PD severity and subtype identification. As such, we suggest that NM-MRI can be used for the identification of specific brain function changes during PD, thereby shedding new light on its pathological mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7914244, "text_md5": "cf64068a1a1766ebcb4c4a7727c08b3c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 110], "publication_year": [112, 116], "title": [127, 240], "keywords": [254, 327], "abstract": [340, 1821], "body": [1830, 22638]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33559725, "doi": "10.1007/s00702-020-02295-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914244", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7914244"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914244\">7914244</a>", "list_title": "PMC7914244  Substantia nigra neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging in patients with different subtypes of Parkinson disease"}

It is based on the clinical observation that the benefit from a dose of levodopa wears off more quickly as PD progresses. Biologically this has been thought to represent decreased buffering capacity for dopamine as nigrostriatal cells die. Buffering capacity has been modeled based on clinical effects, but clinical measurements are influenced by confounding factors. The new method proposes to measure the effect objectively based on the timing of the known response of several brain regions to exogenous levodopa. Such responses are robust and can be quantified using perfusion MRI. Here we present simulation studies based on published clinical dose-response data and an intravenous levodopa infusion. Standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic methods were used to model the response. Then the effect site rate constant   k   was estimated from simulated response data plus Gaussian noise. Predicted time \u2013 effect curves sampled at times consistent with phMRI differ substantially based on clinical severity. Estimated   k   from noisy input data was recovered with good accuracy. These simulation results support the feasibility of levodopa phMRI hysteresis mapping to measure the severity of dopamine denervation objectively and simultaneously in all brain regions with a robust imaging response to exogenous levodopa. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n   \n The intensity and duration of the effect after injection appear to correlate with the degree of akinesia, the action of   -DOPA lasting longer the less pronounced the akinesia  . \n\n\u2014Hirschmann and Mayer (translated) ( ). \n \nParkinson disease (PD) is characterized by progressive death of cells projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum. One of the most important unmet needs in PD is to find objective, quantitative   in vivo   biomarkers of disease severity. Biomarkers of nigrostriatal denervation are sought for several important reasons, including as surrogate markers of disease progression in treatment trials ( ,  ). Putative imaging biomarkers of disease progression include striatal [ F]fluorodopa PET or [ I]ioflupane SPECT. Unfortunately, these techniques do not accurately quantify nigrostriatal cell loss ( ). Presynaptic dopaminergic imaging of the midbrain does ( ); nevertheless, alternative methods would be welcome. \n\nHere we describe a novel potential biomarker, based on the common clinical observation that the benefit from a dose of levodopa wears off more quickly as PD progresses. Early in the course of disease, a small dose of levodopa provides benefit long after the plasma levodopa concentration has declined substantially from its peak. The body responds as if the levodopa in the plasma filled a reservoir and then slowly leaked out to produce benefit. With disease progression, even though the same amount of levodopa circulates in the blood, the benefit wears off much faster, as if the reservoir had become leakier. Biologically, the reservoir may represent the diminishing buffering capacity of ascending dopaminergic axons as midbrain dopamine neurons die off ( ). This wearing off of benefit has been quantified by a mathematical model that postulates a central effect compartment (reservoir) whose concentration of levodopa directly determines the clinical benefit. The buffering capacity in this model can be characterized by a single number, the effect site rate constant   k  , which can be computed from serial measurements of both plasma concentration and clinical status ( ). On average, patients with more severe PD and longer disease duration have a larger (\u201cleakier\u201d)   k   when modeled this way ( ) ( \u2013 ). In fact,   k   can be the strongest predictor of the kinetics of response to levodopa in PD ( ,  ). Dopamine buffering capacity as measured by   k   also correlates significantly with nigrostriatal denervation as measured by DOPA uptake ( ) or dopamine transporter imaging ( ). Unfortunately, the clinical measurements used to determine   k   are influenced by confounding factors such as patient fatigue and motivation, which likely add variance to the measurement. A direct, objective brain measure of response to levodopa may reduce this added variance. \n  \nAcross groups of PD patients,   k   is a surrogate for disease duration (  r   = 0.95). Data redrawn from Harder and Baas ( ) and Contin et al. ( ). \n  \nThe effect of levodopa on the brain can be seen by measuring movement, but also by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), reflecting regional brain activity ( \u2013 ). Crucially, using quantitative techniques, levodopa has no direct vascular effects after adequate carbidopa pretreatment ( \u2013 ). Levodopa's regional CBF effects reflect its regional effects on glucose metabolism and are prominent in pons and midbrain, thalamus, middle frontal gyrus, insula, putamen and cingulate cortex ( ,  ). Drug effects on rCBF in PD can be quantified without ionizing radiation using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI ( \u2013 ). The midbrain rCBF response to levodopa is robust whether measured with [ O]water PET ( \u2013 ) or with perfusion MRI ( ). \n\nHere we show, using simulated data based on published results in human PD patients, that quantifying dopamine buffering capacity   k   is likely to be feasible with existing technology. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Pharmacokinetics \n  \nMeasuring   k   with levodopa phMRI would be infeasible if one had to repeatedly image a subject until a dose of levodopa wore off completely, perhaps for several hours in early PD. Fortunately, with faster wearing-off as PD progresses, there is also faster \u201cwearing-on\u201d or onset of drug effect ( ,  \u2013 ). In fact, with a completely unrelated drug that also shows equilibration delay, giving the drug as a rapid intravenous (i.v.) infusion followed by a slow maintenance infusion allowed estimating the   k   just as precisely from the first 20 min of data as from 3  h of data ( ). Fortunately we have used exactly this approach to dose levodopa in PD: a fast i.v. loading dose followed by a slow maintenance infusion ( ) ( ). This infusion method allows us to transiently achieve plasma levodopa concentrations of 1,500\u20133,500 ng/mL, so we can measure   k   from both the rapid rise and fall of plasma levels. \n  \nPlasma levodopa concentrations in PD patients following the \u201cfinal dose\u201d intravenous infusion method in Black et al. ( ). The 3 lines mark the mean, 90th and 10th percentile for samples collected in the corresponding intervals. Redrawn from data reported in Black et al. ( ). \n  \nFor present purposes, likely time \u2013 concentration curves   C  (  t  ) in people with PD were taken from this infusion protocol, which aims to produce a steady-state levodopa concentration of 600 ng/ml, and consists of a 10-min loading dose at 0.6426 mg/kg followed by a maintenance infusion at 2.882 \u00d7 10  mg/kg/min \u00d7 (140 yr\u2013age)/yr ( ). For a 65-year-old 70-kg person that means 45 mg over 10 min followed by 0.15 mg/min, for a total dose over 150 min of 66 mg. That i.v. dose is bioequivalent to 78 mg oral levodopa ( ), though of course i.v. dosing leads to much higher transient peak plasma concentrations. \n\nUsing those data, we aggregated individual data points by time bins and plotted the mean, to estimate the most likely   C   (t)  , and the 10th and 90th percentile, to deal with a range of metabolic rates in patients ( ); see mpdp1.ipynb at  ). The NumPy and matplotlib libraries in Python were used for simulations and data visualization (Python Programming Language,  ; NumPy,  ; MatPlotLib,  ) ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Modeling the Effect Compartment \n  \nHolford and Sheiner describe the theoretical background for the effect compartment model ( ). A later paper by Sheiner's group simplifies the modeling with the assumption that   C   =   C   at steady state, leading to the definition of the effect compartment concentration curve by the simpler differential equation   C  \u2032 =   k  (  C  \u2013  C  ) ( ). \n\nIf we use piecewise linear interpolation to estimate   C  (  t  ) between blood samples [as did Unadkat et al. ( )],   C   can be computed in closed form. We can write   C   as   C  (  t  \u2013  t  ) =   C  (  t  ) +   m  (  t  \u2013  t  ) on the interval [  t  ,   t  ], where   m   = [  C  (  t  )\u2013  C  (  t  )]/ [  t  -  t  ]. We need a value for the effect site concentration before the infusion starts,   C  (  t  ). For the purposes of this report, we can reasonably assume   C  (  t  ) =   C  (  t  ), which will be approximately true if at the time of the first blood draw patients have refrained from taking oral levodopa for 8\u201310 h, since   is <5 h, and usually <2.5 h [see Table 4 in Contin et al. ( )]. \n\nThe solution to this initial value problem is \n\ndefined on the interval (  t  ,   t  ] ( ). \n\n\n### Predicting Effect From Levodopa Concentrations in PD \n  \nTo test this method, one needs to estimate a reasonable variety of time: effect curves in PD. Not only   k   but also the concentration\u2013effect curve changes with disease severity. Contin et al. showed that a sigmoid   E   model reasonably fit the data from a wide range of PD severity ( ). We adopt their measurements of   EC  ,   n   (the Hill coefficient) and   k   for a variety of disease severity groups; namely, means for Hoehn and Yahr ( ) stages I through IV in addition to the mildest and most severely affected individual subjects in the Contin et al. report (their Table 4). These parameters and the sigmoid   E   model are combined to create time\u2013effect curves that we could expect from a brain region whose activity changes reliably with increased dopamine release in the brain with administration of exogenous levodopa. Note that the dopamine receptor may be \u201cupstream\u201d (e.g., posterior putamen) to the dopa-responsive region (e.g., motor cortex); dopamine receptors are not needed in the dopa-responsive region itself. The simulated data use a baseline CBF of 50 ml/hg/min and maximal effect was set at 35 ml/hg/min, consistent with a ~70% rCBF increase in midbrain after a relatively large levodopa-carbidopa dose ( ). \n\n\n### Adding Noise \n  \nThe brain imaging time\u2013effect curves assessed by any real brain imaging method will not be perfect, noise-free estimates, but will be contaminated by variability from biological or instrumentation issues. To test how well we can expect to recover   k   (and the other pharmacodynamic parameters) from a real experiment, we add noise to the simulated data described in the previous paragraph. We added Gaussian noise with a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 12.9%; this value was chosen based on the CoV in a cortical gray matter region across sixteen 34-s CBF images in 11 adults with PD scanned with a pCASL sequence while fixating a crosshair (unpublished data, K. J. Black and colleagues) ( ,  ). For this study, all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines. The experimental protocol was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office (ID # 201703122). All participants provided informed consent. \n\n\n### Parameter Estimation \n  \nWe simultaneously estimated k , EC , and n from the data, given the model, using the lmfit package in Python (ampgo followed by emcee modules) ( ). \n\n\n### Accuracy \n  \nThe accuracy of the method was tested by comparing the estimated   k   to the input   k  . Secondary similar analyses were done for   EC   and   n  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Predicted Levodopa Time: Concentration Curves in Effect Compartment \n  \n shows the expected concentration over time in the effect compartment, depending on the severity of PD. One can easily appreciate the faster exchange between plasma and the effect compartment when   k   is high (i.e., when the equilibration half-life   is short). \n  \nPredicted levodopa concentration in the effect compartment at various disease severity levels. Curves are labeled by   =   ln   2/  k   from more severe PD (  = 5 min.) to milder PD (  = 277 min.). \n  \n\n### Time: Effect Curves by Disease Severity \n  \nWe modeled the expected rCBF response in midbrain to the rapid i.v. infusion, based on published levodopa pharmacokinetics in PD ( ) and published mean pharmacodynamic parameters for Hoehn & Yahr stages I, II, III, and IV ( ,  ). The predicted signals are quite distinct, assuming a typical   C  (  t  ) time:plasma curve ( ). If a given subject's pharmacokinetics produce higher plasma levels, the distinctions are still fairly clear ( ). Of course, if an individual's plasma levels are low, an effect may not be evident, especially in more severe PD ( ). \n  \nPredicted time:effect curves at various disease severity levels assuming   (A)   mean,   (B)   high, and   (C)   low   C  (  t  ) in response to the levodopa infusion. \n  \n\n### Accuracy \n  \n k   estimated from time: effect curves in the presence of noise was generally accurate ( ; see also  ). More advanced disease led to more distinct predicted time\u2013activity curves (see  ), reflected in more accurate results ( ). \n  \nEstimated   k   (vertical axis) across 100 sets of noise added to the time: effect curve computed for the   k  ,   EC  , and   n   for various severities of PD as reported in Contin et al.

Width of plot is proportional to frequency of output of the given magnitude. Filled circle: input n. Horizontal lines note the 5, 50, and 95th percentiles. At right, similar results are shown for noise CoV = 5% for   (D)   mean,   (E)   high, and   (F)   low   C  (  t  ) responses to the LD infusion. \n  \nResults were more accurate if the noise was reduced from a CoV of 12.9 to 5% ( ; see also  ). Similar plots for   EC   and   n   are provided as  . \n\nIn an attempt to improve further the accuracy, we examined the effect of spreading the levodopa infusion over twice the time. We hypothesized that the limited temporal resolution of the perfusion MR method, combined with the relatively small timing difference in onset of action in mild vs. very mild PD, limited discrimination at the milder end of the severity range. Results are shown in  . Similar plots for   EC   and   n   are provided as  . \n  \nEstimated   k   (vertical axis) across 100 sets of noise added to the time:effect curve computed for the   k  ,   EC  , and   n   for various severities of PD as reported in Contin et al. ( ) (horizontal axis), with   C  (  t  ) estimated for an levodopa infusion twice as long (at half the rate, so that the total infused dose is equivalent).   (A)   noise CoV = 12.9%;   (B)   noise CoV = 5%. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe present a novel brain imaging method for objectively quantifying disease severity in Parkinson disease (PD), which we refer to as dopamine buffering capacity imaging, or more precisely, levodopa phMRI hysteresis mapping. The temporally distinct time: effect curves predicted in   suggest that even with some imperfection in the rCBF signal, we can expect to derive a reasonably accurate   k   for a brain region that responds to exogenous levodopa with a clear dose-response curve. \n\nDemonstrating efficacy for potential disease-modifying therapies in PD has been difficult. Delayed start designs and similar approaches that rely on change in clinical severity over time require years to complete, large patient groups, and even then have not yet been successful ( ). A validated biomarker would be of great value in improving this situation ( ). The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research designates \u201cthe identification, development and use of biomarkers to diagnose and track Parkinson's disease\u201d as a priority area, noting that a successful biomarker \u201cwould mean better disease management for patients\u201d and \u201cimprove and speed clinical development of disease-modifying therapies\u201d ( ). In simulated data based on published results and reasonable assumptions, levodopa phMRI hysteresis mapping appears likely to fill that need. \n\nOf course one does not need an MRI machine to tell if a drug is improving movement in PD, and the present proposal draws on previous studies using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling of tapping speed or UPDRS score response to levodopa challenge. However, the assessment of drug response using brain imaging is novel, and provides several potential advantages. The rCBF response is objective, rater-independent, and does not require subject movement. Furthermore, buffering capacity is measured simultaneously in all levodopa-responsive brain regions rather than just the motor system, potentially informing pathophysiological research on the increasingly recognized non-motor symptoms of PD ( ). The only assumption is that regional brain activity somewhere in the brain corresponds temporally to clinical severity. \n\nChan, Nutt, and Holford have subsequently extended the PK-PD model with the aim of better modeling long-term changes with disease progression in PD ( ,  ). Their revised model includes factors intended to account for clinical observations like morning benefit and the long-duration response, and in their data   k   (reported as   T   =   ln   2/  k  ) did not change significantly over time. However, as they note, other factors could explain the difference in results, and their more complicated model was made possible by a very large set of longitudinal data. While the extended model may be ideal for optimal understanding of physiology from clinical PK-PD data, it is not essential for the present purpose of identifying a biomarker of nigrostriatal denervation in PD. In other words, if   k   as derived from the model we use correlates highly with disease severity, it will serve its intended purpose just fine. \n\nEvery step of this method has been proven individually: i.v. levodopa has been used safely for over 50 years ( ); the infusion method described for the simulated data has been used in over 100 subjects [( ,  ) and Black et al. unpublished data]; levodopa concentration can be quantified accurately in plasma ( ); the response to levodopa can be measured by ASL fMRI ( \u2013 ); midbrain has a robust rCBF response to single, clinically sensible doses of levodopa ( \u2013 ,  ), and software exists for estimating PK-PD parameters from fMRI data on a voxel-by-voxel or regional level ( ,  ). In other words, every part of the method described here is well proven; it is their combination and interpretation as a disease severity measure that is novel. \n\n### Foreseeable Obstacles and Possible Solutions \n  \nSome potential difficulties in implementing dopamine buffering capacity imaging are foreseeable, but can be mitigated. These include a need for high temporal resolution, uncertain optimal dosing, head movement during MRI, and variable attention and alertness during the scans. \n\n#### Temporal Resolution \n  \nPrior data showing robust rCBF responses to levodopa averaged data across a group and over several scans in the pre- and on-drug conditions, i.e., with a time resolution of about 30 min. Measuring dopamine buffering capacity in individual subjects pushes the envelope, requiring measuring response to levodopa in single subjects and at a time resolution of 1\u20132 min or better. Fortunately, current pCASL methods allow an unbiased whole-brain measure of blood flow in about 5\u201335 s. However, these images are statistically noisy. If estimated   k   proves less accurate with individual subject data than these simulations predict, additional information contained in the data may strengthen prediction of disease severity. Specifically, from the plasma levodopa concentration curve and the MRI response data one computes not only   k   but also   EC   and   n  , which also change with disease severity ( ). Possibly combining all three parameter estimates may more accurately measure disease severity. \n\n\n#### Optimal Dosing \n  \nSubjects with more advanced disease will show little response if they also happen to have low plasma levodopa levels. Solutions could include higher dosing for more severely affected individuals, though this choice could increase the risk of dyskinesias in the scanner that could affect comfort or head movement. Alternatively, if needed, one could estimate the optimal dose for each subject with, say, a single small test dose of i.v. levodopa with a pre- and post-drug blood sample, on a day prior to the scan day. \n\n\n#### Head Movement \n  \nIn our experience, most PD patients do well holding the head still during an MRI session. However, acquiring a single CBF image can take 6\u201334 s ( ), an interval long enough that head movement on the scale of mm may be non-trivial. Participants with levodopa-induced dyskinesias may have additional head movement. Within-frame head movement adds to variance and may bias quantitative estimates. Solutions may include more rigid head fixation, shorter repetition times (TRs), prospective motion correction, or removing or underweighting CBF images compromised by movement ( ). \n\n\n#### Attention/Alertness \n  \nIn initial pilot studies, we find that several factors combine to make continued alertness throughout the scan period difficult: PD patients often have insomnia, the scans are long and repetitive, and levodopa contributes to sleepiness. Solutions may include adding an attention task (though that will change resting brain activity), study staff repeatedly awakening the participant, or monitoring for alertness and removing or accounting statistically for frames during which the participant appears asleep. \n\n\n\n### Next Steps \n  \nThe simplest first step to validating this method is correlative in nature. Specifically, one would enroll people with a wide variety of PD severity and compare regional   k   values, most likely in midbrain or posterior putamen, to clinical measures of disease severity such as off-period UPDRS scores ( ). More definitive validation of dopamine buffering imaging may include longer-term or autopsy studies in patients, necropsy studies in animals with graded nigrostriatal lesions, or comparison to the recently validated midbrain [ C]DTBZ PET approach ( ). If these studies are successful, the dopamine buffering capacity imaging method will beg for further application as a surrogate marker of disease severity in PD. \n\n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe data generated for this study can be found with the code used to generate it, at [ ]. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Washington University Human Research Protection Office.

Impairment of the neurovascular unit (NVU) has been hypothesized to play a critical role in early PD pathophysiology, and to precede neurodegenerative mechanisms. [C-11]-PE2I (  N  -(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-methyl-phenyl)nortropane) (PE2I) is a PET radiotracer targeting neuronal dopamine transporters (DaT) with high specificity, allowing for highly accurate and specific DaT quantification. We investigated NVU integrity using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI in a prospective cohort of 26 patients with PD, and correlated our findings with analysis of striatal DaT density using PE2I PET in a subcohort of 17 patients. Analysis was performed in FreeSurfer to obtain rCBF and mean standardized regional PET avidity. Pearson correlations and Mann\u2013Whitney tests were performed. Significantly lower mean normalized striatal PE2I SUV values were seen in multiple regions in patients with greater disease duration (  p   < 0.05). PET uptake in the putamen correlated with disease duration independent of patient age. Stratifying patients based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (stratified into \u2265 27 vs. < 27), there was statistically significantly lower PE2I PET avidity in the higher MoCA score group in both more and less affected sides of the caudate, putamen and pallidum (  p   < 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d and rCBF values was also seen in the L and R cerebellum WM (  r   = \u22120.43 and \u22120.47,   p   < 0.05). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between dominant hand pegboard test results and rCBF in the less affected pallidum (  r   = \u22120.41;   p   = 0.046). A statistically significant negative correlation of ASL MRI with [11C]-PE2I PET was also found (  r   = \u22120.53 to \u22120.58;   p  -value 0.017\u20130.033) between left cerebral WM rCBF and more and less affected striatal PET regions. Our ROI-based analyses suggest that longer disease duration is associated with lower rCBF and lower PE2I mean SUV, implying greater NVU dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal loss, respectively. Combined ASL MRI and PE2I PET imaging could inform future prospective clinical trials providing an improved mechanistic understanding of the disease, laying the foundation for the development of early disease biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder. Traditionally, PD is still diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms and signs of resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. There are many well-validated and highly studied clinical batteries and rating scales available to quantitate motor features, such as the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) \u2013 Part III \u201cMotor Symptoms off\u201d ( ), or the 9-hole pegboard testing to assess motor dexterity ( ). However, these classic motor symptoms of PD often present later in the course of the disease, becoming apparent when almost 50\u201380% of dopaminergic neurons has been lost ( ). Thus, there is a strong need to identify early disease biomarkers that may allow earlier diagnosis. Furthermore, non-motor features of PD may be as, or more, important. For example mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are well-recognized as important contributing factors to disease morbidity ( ). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score offers a comprehensive assessment of executive cognitive function and is increasingly used as a screening tool in PD ( ). Criteria for diagnosis of cognitive impairment in PD have been established delineating the importance of early diagnosis of cognitive decline before progression to dementia ( ). However, there remains a critical need for biomarkers capable of detecting and tracking changes in PD in the anatomical and network correlates of such important non-motor features. \n\nIt is widely accepted that the pathophysiology of PD is related to selective neurodegeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum. Earlier pathophysiologic mechanisms that may precede nigrostriatal neuronal loss are the subject of current research. Neuroinflammation with resulting alpha-synuclein accumulation is a key pathophysiological event in PD, and is closely associated with impaired blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability ( ;  ). Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which is composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, and parenchymal cells ( ), correlates with increased BBB permeability and microvascular dysfunction, and has been hypothesized to play a critical role in PD pathophysiology. Cerebral microvascular dysfunction appears to contribute to dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD ( ). \n\nArterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-contrast MRI technique which allows assessment of cerebral perfusion and is based on the principle of magnetically labeling protons in arterial blood prior to their entry into the tissue of interest ( ). This provides an advantage over dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), the latter necessitating the intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), which is associated with inherent risks ( ). ASL allows assessment of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and can quantify NVU dysfunction. \n\nTo investigate neuronal dopamine transporter density in PD, [11C]   N  -(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-methyl-phenyl)nortropane (PE2I) has been increasingly used. PE2I is a PET radiotracer which selectively binds neuronal dopamine transporters, allowing non-invasive   in vivo   quantitation of neuronal dopamine transporter density. The purpose of our study was to investigate dopaminergic neuronal loss and NVU dysfunction in a prospective clinical cohort of patients with PD, using [11C]-PE2I PET and ASL MRI, respectively, as well as to correlate advanced imaging findings with clinical and demographic characteristics, specifically metrics assessing motor symptoms (MDS-UPRDS scores, 9-hole pegboard testing) and cognitive impairment (MoCA). \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Study Population \n  \nTwenty six subjects were prospectively enrolled in this institutional review board-approved study. Informed consent was obtained at enrollment from all the participants. Inclusion criteria were PD clinical diagnosis of 3 to 12 years of duration from onset of symptoms, 30 to 70 years-old at time of enrollment, well-established response to one or more dopaminergic agents and/or amantadine, absence of disabling dyskinesias, and PD Hoehn & Yahr stage 2\u20133, and absence of a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Exclusion criteria were symptoms or signs suggestive of a Parkinson\u2019s plus diagnosis, receiving dopamine receptor blocking agents such as neuroleptics, treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, a history of brain surgery, history of cancer or other significant medical disease such as autoimmune disorders or others within the past 5 years, any major psychiatric condition and any history of other serious neurological disorders such as a clinically significant stroke, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, other neurodegenerative disorders, encephalitis or repeated head traumas. All enrolled patients were evaluated by a movement disorder specialist at the time of enrollment, with clinical assessment including evaluation of motor, sensory, cognitive and overall disease scores. Clinical chart review was performed by trained research personnel with documentation of duration of disease, symptoms, and medications. MRI and PET/CT studies were performed shortly after enrollment in the study, as discussed below. \n\n\n### MRI Acquisition \n  \nAll subjects underwent ASL MRI. All MRI data was acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Prisma MRI scanner using a 32-channel head resonator. The 3D T -Weighted scan was acquired with 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm isotropic resolution using a sagittal MPRAGE sequence with a TR/TE/TI of 1800 ms/2.25 ms/900 ms respectively. The ASL sequence was a 3D pseudocontinuous sequence (J. J. Wang, USC) ( ). ASL acquisition parameters included a 2000 ms labeling time, a 800 ms post-labeling delay and a 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm resolution with 60 slices. \n\n\n### PET/CT Acquisition \n  \nA subcohort of 17 patients underwent [11C]-PE2I PET/CT (performed on the same day as the MRI examination). [11C]-PE2I PET/CT data was acquired on a 64 slice Siemens Biograph mCT scanner. The [11C]-PE2I static images were summed from 30 to 60 min after injection. [11C]-PE2I targets neuronal dopamine transporters ( ). The [11C] PE2I dose administered was 384.1 MBq +/\u2212 51.8 MBq (10.38 \u00b1 1.40 mCi). Resolution was 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 2.0 mm, with a 40 cm field of view. The PET images were acquired immediately after the radiotracer injection. \n\n\n### MRI Processing \n  \nThe ASL rCBF data was processed using the MATLAB based ASLtbx ( ). rCBF images were registered to the 3D T -Weighted data by aligning the proton density (PD) image acquired with the same sequence using the FLIRT package within FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Linear Image Registration Tool; Oxford, United Kingdom) ( ;  ). The 3D T -Weighted MRI data was analyzed utilizing the FreeSurfer 6.0 image analysis suite  ( ;  ). Analyzed regions comprised the bilateral striatum (caudate, globus pallidus, putamen) for ASL and [11C]-PE2I PET data. Stratification was performed based on more versus less severely clinically affected side as documented in the standardized clinical neurological examination. Since basal ganglia control contralateral motor function, the opposite side of the one considered more affected clinically was used as the more affected region for imaging purposes. Additionally, the bilateral supratentorial white matter, and bilateral cerebellum was evaluated for ASL analysis for the 26 patients with available ASL data. Axial T  weighted MRI and an rCBF map from a representative patient is presented in  . \n  \nFifty five year old male with PD diagnosed 5 years ago with moderate disease based on MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d score and associated mild cognitive impairment.

Analysis was performed with FreeSurfer 6.0 derived quantitative cortical and subcortical segmentation of structures. [11C]-PE2I PET values were measured for each subregion defined within FreeSurfer. SUV values for the same regions used in our ASL analysis were determined for a subcohort of 17 patients. An SUV for the occipital lobe was generated by combining values from the cuneus, lateral occipital, lingual and pericalcarine regions based on previously published methodology ( ). Each target SUV was normalized to this combined occipital SUV. PET findings from a representative patient are presented in  . \n\n\n### Subgroup Stratification and Statistical Analysis \n  \nStatistical analysis was performed utilizing Graph-Pad Prism version 8. Patients were stratified into the following subgroups based on clinical characteristics. Stratification by duration of disease was based upon a cut-off of 5 years (less than 5 years versus greater than 5 years). Stratification by MoCA and MDS-UPDRS scores was based on previously published data suggesting a cut-off MoCA score of 26 between cognitively normal and cognitively abnormal individuals ( ), and a cut-off MDS-UPDRS score of 32 for differentiating between mild and moderate disease ( ). We stratified our cohort into subgroups based on clinically meaningful criteria. The final number of patients for each analyzed subgroup is presented in  . Of note, final numbers for each subgroup depended on available data and thus differed among subgroups, since all 26 patients underwent ASL MRI and a subset of 17 patients underwent PE2I PET. Furthermore, some of the clinical information was not available or clinical tests were not performed for some of the patients. Mann\u2013 Whitney   U  -tests were performed to evaluate for differences between subgroups. Correction for multiple comparisons was accomplished using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1. To investigate the relationship between ASL MRI and [11C]-PE2I -PET data as well as the relationship between clinical scores and imaging data, Spearman correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed comparing regional [11C]-PE2I PET uptake normalized to the occipital region with both subject age and disease duration as covariates. \n  \nStratification of the study cohort into subgroups based on clinical characteristics. \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Clinical and Demographic Characteristics of the Study Population \n  \nSubjects in our cohort had a mean age of 59.5 (range: 44\u201370,   SD   = \u00b1 5.9) years with mean duration of disease of 6.6 (range: 1\u201313,   SD   = \u00b1 3.5) years. The mean MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d score was 28.7 (range: 12\u201354,   SD   = \u00b1 11.5) and the mean MoCA score was 25.9 (range: 21\u201330,   SD   = \u00b1 2.2). With regard to clinical symptoms, 13 (50%) patients had more pronounced symptoms on the left side and 13 (50%) patients had more pronounced symptoms on the right side. 85% (22/26) patients were undergoing treatment with levodopa-containing medications, the majority in combination with other medications, with mean LEDD was 749 mg (  SD   = \u00b1 483). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects enrolled in this study are presented in  . \n  \nClinical and demographic characteristics of the study population. \n  \n\n### Disease Duration \n  \nStratification of the cohort based on disease duration resulted in   N   = 11 patients with disease duration of \u2264 5 years (all underwent ASL MRI and a subset of   N   = 8 underwent [11C]-PE2I PET); and   N   = 14 patients with disease duration of > 5 years (all underwent ASL MRI and a subset of   N   = 8 additionally underwent [11C]-PE2I PET). Several regions displayed lower rCBF values with longer disease duration but did not reach significance. A statistically significantly lower PE2I avidity in the group with longer disease duration was shown for multiple regions in  . The differences between the two groups were more pronounced for [11C]-PE2I SUV in the basal ganglia compared to reference regions (cerebellum cortex and WM, WM). Following Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, our findings remained significant for all analyzed regions with the exception of left and right cerebellar cortex. rCBF and [11C]-PE2I SUV values for the different regions stratified by disease duration are presented in  . \n  \nPatients with Parkinson disease (PD) stratified by disease duration (>5 years, gray boxes; \u22645 years, white boxes). Region-specific ASL-based rCBF values (x-axis -   A  ) and PE2I-based mean SUV (x-axis-   B  ) are provided. Y-axis denotes evaluated brain regions. \n    \nASL rCBF and PE2I PET SUV values, stratified by disease duration. \n    \n\n### Montreal Cognitive Assessment \n  \nThe cutoff to stratify a subject as having MCI/dementia was 27 based on previously published data and therefore 15 patients were considered as having MCI (MoCA scores < 27). Stratification of the cohort resulted in   N   = 15 patients with MoCA scores < 27 (all underwent ASL MRI and a subset of   N   = 10 additionally underwent [11C]-PE2I PET) and   N   = 11 patients with MoCA scores \u2265 27 (all underwent ASL MRI and a subset of   N   = 7 underwent [11C]-PE2I PET). Several regions displayed higher rCBF values in patients with greater MoCA but did not reach significance ( ). Furthermore, in the subgroup of patients that had PET data available (  N   = 17) comparing PE2I avidity between the two subgroups, lower [11C]-PE2I avidity in the higher MoCA score group was found with statistically significantly lower [11C]-PE2I SUV values normalized to the occipital lobe in the caudate, pallidum, and putamen (  p   = 0.005-  p   = 0.025) ( ). Following Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, our findings remained significant for all analyzed striatal regions. \n  \nASL rCBF and PE2I PET SUV values, stratified by MoCA score. \n    \nWhen normalized to occipital lobe, there was a moderate negative statistically significant correlation between MoCA scores and normalized SUV in the pallidum on the more affected side (  p   = 0.03) ( ). \n  \nCorrelation between striatal PE2I SUV and MoCA scores. \n    \n\n### MDS VO Part 3 \n  \nUsing Pearson correlation there was a moderate negative correlation between MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d and rCBF values in the L and R cerebellum WM (  r   = \u22120.43 and \u22120.47,   p   = 0.035 and   p   = 0.021), which may suggest that milder motor symptoms of PD correlate with higher cerebellar rCBF. Patients were additionally stratified based on MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d score into groups of mild disease-MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d \u2264 32 and moderate disease-MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d > 32 ( ). Differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. No patients with an MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d 58 (severe disease) were present in our cohort. There was no significant correlation between MDS-UPDRS part 3 (motor) \u201coff\u201d score and [11C]-PE2I SUV values normalized to the occipital lobe. \n\n\n### Dominant Hand Pegboard Testing \n  \nFor this analysis, we used all the patients that had available ASL data and Dominant hand Pegboard testing (  N   = 24). A statistically significant, moderate negative correlation was found between Dominant hand Pegboard Test results and rCBF in the less affected pallidum (  r   = \u22120.41;   p   = 0.046). Dominant hand Pegboard testing did not demonstrate any significant correlations with [11C]-PE2I SUV values in any of the analyzed brain regions. Non-dominant hand Pegboard testing did not demonstrate any significant correlations with rCBF values in any of the analyzed brain regions. \n\n\n### Combined Imaging \n  \nWe additionally correlated supratentorial rCBF with striatal [11C]-PE2I PET SUV. For this analysis, we included the 17 patients that had both ASL and [11C]-PE2I PET data. A statistically significant moderate negative correlation was present between left cerebral WM rCBF and more and less affected striatal [11C]-PE2I avidity: more affected caudate (  r   = \u22120.54,   p   = 0.026), more affected putamen (  r   = \u22120.53,   p   = 0.031), more affected pallidum (  r   = \u22120.58,   p   = 0.017) and less affected pallidum (  r   = \u22120.052,   p   = 0.033). A moderate negative correlation for the left cerebral WM and the less affected caudate (  r   = \u22120.48) and less affected putamen (  r   = \u22120.43) did not reach statistical significance (  p   = 0.054 and 0.085, respectively). Analogous analyses for the right cerebral WM demonstrated a similar trend however did not reach statistical significance for either the more or the less affected striatum (  r   = \u22120.40 to \u22120.31;   p   = 0.109 to 0.221). \n\n\n### Effect of Age \n  \nA multiple linear regression was performed comparing regional [C-11]-PE2I PET uptake normalized to the occipital region with both subject age and disease duration as covariates. Significant correlation of PET uptake in the putamen with disease duration was found to be   p   = 0.004 and   p   = 0.022 on the more and less affected sides respectively. No significant correlation of PET uptake with subject age was observed ( ). \n  \nA correlation of [C-11]-PE2I PET uptake normalized to the occipital lobe is shown with disease duration for the putamen lateralized into the more or less affected side. A multiple regression was performed with both subject age as disease duration as covariates. Significant correlation of PET uptake in the putamen with disease duration was found to be   p   = 0.004 and   p   = 0.022 on the more and less affected sides respectively. No significant correlation with subject age was observed. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this study, we combined ASL MRI-based assessment of the NVU with [11C]-PE2I PET-based assessment of striatal dopamine transporter density to assess pathophysiologic mechanisms in a prospective clinical cohort of patients with PD. This approach allowed us to place evaluation of NVU integrity and thereby BBB disruption into a more established clinical context. \n\nAt baseline, the BBB has tightly sealed cell\u2013cell contacts involving the capillary endothelial cells and astrocyte endfoot processes, resulting in low transcellular and paracellular permeability. Loss of BBB integrity is associated with decreased relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) ( ), microvascular dysfunction and hemodynamic impairment ( ). BBB permeability is thereby linked to integrity of the NVU ( ). \n\nNeuroinflammation with resulting alpha-synuclein accumulation is a hallmark event in PD, and is closely associated with impaired blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability and microvascular dysfunction ( ;  ;  ), in particular given that certain BBB-targeting metalloproteinases (MMP) can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( ;  ). BBB dysfunction in PD has been suggested as a pathophysiologic mechanism based on compelling histopathologic findings including capillary extravasation of cells and proteins, thinning of the capillary endothelial cell layer, and extravascular IgG deposition ( ;  ). \n\nCerebral microvascular dysfunction appears to contribute to dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD ( ). Previous work using mouse models of acute, sub-acute and chronic PD demonstrated that area and density of endothelial cells were reduced in regions related to PD pathophysiology such as the substantia nigra and the striatum in all three models, further supporting the importance of microvascular damage in the pathogenesis of PD ( ). The findings of microvascular dysfunction in the substantia nigra have also been suggested by a study comparing number of capillaries, length and diameter of human brain tissue in PD and normal controls ( ). \n\nNVU dysfunction, associated with a decrease in relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), has been proposed as an early pathophysiologic mechanism in PD [19], and several ASL-based studies have revealed altered cerebral perfusion patterns in patients with PD compared to normal subjects. [20] ASL-derived differences in rCBF in PD are presently a subject of active investigation, with one study documenting no significant differences in rCBF for any of the evaluated regions ( ) while other studies demonstrated decreased striatal rCBF in patients with PD ( ), concordant with our findings of decreased rCBF in patients with longer disease duration, noting that our study did not include normal subjects for direct comparison. Differences in rCBF distribution have been attributed to BBB dysfunction in PD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases and evaluation of BBB integrity in PD remains the subject of active research. For example, an ASL-MRI-based approach to BBB assessment integrates a diffusion preparation module with pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) and a 3D gradient readout ( ). Appropriate diffusion weighting allows for separation of the tissue and capillary fractions of the ASL signal and in turn allows quantification of capillary permeability of water (kW) between the tissue and intravascular compartments ( ). Of note, there are currently no diffusion-weighted ASL-based or dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI-based studies in patients with PD. \n\nFor evaluation of neuronal dopamine transporter density in PD, to date most imaging studies have used 123I-Iodoflupane (DatSCAN) SPECT, which is in wide clinical use in the work-up of parkinsonian syndrome. [11C]-PE2I PET provides a more accurate and specific quantification of neuronal dopamine transporters in PD compared to DatSCAN SPECT. [11C]-PE2I is a cocaine analog which binds neuronal dopamine transporters with high specificity. While [11C]-PE2I is structurally related to DatSCAN, [11C]-PE2I has the advantage of higher selectivity as it binds neuronal dopamine transporters only, whereas DatSCAN additionally targets serotonin and norepinephrine transporters ( ). [18F]   N  -(3-fluoropropyl)-2\u03b2-carboxymethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane (FP-CIT) has recently been demonstrated to have utility in dopamine transporter imaging in PD and related syndromes, with comparable image quality to [11C]-PE2I ( ). \n\nAnother approach to visualization of dopamine depletion is [F-18]-Fluoro-DOPA (FDOPA) PET. FDOPA is limited in quantifying neuronal dopamine transporters as it illustrates the activity of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase which represents an intraneuronal reaction and is not specific for dopamine. Published data from a direct comparison of F-DOPA and [11C]-PE2I demonstrated greater sensitivity of [11C]-PE2I for the detection of differences in motor symptom severity and progression over time in PD ( ). Studies comparing [11C]-PE2I PET to combined DatSCAN SPECT and 18F-FDG PET further demonstrated superiority of [11C]-PE2I PET ( ). \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the concurrent use of ASL imaging and [11C]-PE2I PET. We found statistically significantly lower striatal PE2I avidity in the sub-cohort of patients with longer disease duration, as well as a trend for lower rCBF values in the same cohort. \n\nThe significant negative correlations we identified between MoCA scores and [11C]-PE2I SUV values in the basal ganglia reflect current understanding that cognitive impairment in PD is not, for the most part, directly tied to dopaminergic neuronal loss, as patients with lower MoCA score had higher [11C]-PE2I SUV. Of note, cognitive impairment has been suggested to precede the development of \u201cclassic\u201d motor symptoms in PD ( ), and while our study only incorporates one imaging time point, this may reflect a pathophysiologic basis for our findings and needs to be studied further in future longitudinal studies. \n\nPreviously published data have shown that rCBF values in basal ganglia are inversely correlated to motor dysfunction ( ). Stratification based on MDS-UPDRS score into groups of mild disease-MDS \u2264 32 and moderate disease-MDS-UPDRS > 32 did not reveal a clear trend for rCBF values, although Pearson correlation analysis did demonstrate a weak negative correlation between MDS-UPDRS and cerebellar rCBF values. \n\nOur study has several limitations, most notably small sample size overall as well as small sample size of the various subgroups. Another limitation is lack of direct comparison to non-diseased subjects. Furthermore, our study is cross-sectional and lacks longitudinal follow-up data. However, we demonstrate feasibility of concurrent non-invasive imaging of cerebral perfusion and dopaminergic neuronal loss, and place our findings in the clinical context of motor and cognitive decline in PD. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur ROI-based analyses suggest that longer disease duration is associated with lower rCBF and lower striatal [11C]-PE2I avidity, implying greater NVU dysfunction and greater dopaminergic neuronal loss, respectively. Correlative studies of ASL and [11C]-PE2I PET data further suggest that dopaminergic neuronal loss may be independent from cognitive impairment in PD. \n\nCombined perfusion MRI and dopamine transporter targeted PET imaging may inform future prospective clinical trials, thereby providing an improved mechanistic understanding of PD and related neurodegenerative diseases, and laying the foundation for the development of early disease biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board \u2013 Weill Cornell Medicine.

It was first described in a large American kindred (MN-A family) characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia similar to those of other SCAs with slow disease progression.  The affected individuals in that family had longer repeat tracts than the 21 asymptomatic individuals. These results indicate that repeat length plays a role in disease penetrance.  However, further analysis of other families showed that the pathogenic range can vary among families and that a positive test for repeat expansion, regardless of the repeat size, cannot be used to predict whether an asymptomatic individual will develop ataxia. ,  Normal alleles have 15-50 repeats, while not all expanded alleles (>50 repeats) are pathogenic. Individuals with ataxia most often have 80-250 repeats; however, repeat sizes ranging from 71 to more than 1300 repeats have been found both in individuals who develop ataxia and those who do not. While it is now clear that CTA/CTG repeat expansion can cause ataxia, several issues have yet to be clarified, including reduced penetrance, gender effects, normal and pathogenic expansion ranges, detection in other neurodegenerative psychiatric disorders and even in the normal population. - \n\nFurthermore, the phenomenology of SCA8 is relatively variable than those of the other types of SCA, and its spectrum variance is not well established.  A large number of clinical analyses have demonstrated that SCA8 presents as a very slowly progressive ataxia, ,  and affected individuals displayed gait, limb ataxia, speech, and oculomotor incoordination. However, there have been several reports of nonataxic symptoms of SCA8 as atypical phenotypes in the past decade.  -  Those reports suggest that there are molecular, genetic, and clinical heterogeneities in SCA8. Two newly detected cases with a nonataxic SCA8 phenotype are described herein, and the various nonataxic phenotypes and possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed. \n\n\n## Case Report \n  \nWe identified two cases with SCA8 confirmed by genetic analysis. We obtained consents from the patients and performed neurological exams, and collected blood samples. The clinical features, disease course, family history, and co-morbidities were also investigated and analyzed in these two newly diagnosed cases. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. The pedigrees of the two cases are shown in  . \n\n### Family A \n  \nA 49-year-old, right-handed man (II: 3) ( ) initially presented with a 6-year history of progressive gait disturbance. He had no history of drug exposure, trauma, or other medical problems, but his family history revealed a similar gait problem in his brother. The initial neurological examination revealed rigidity and bradykinesia on the right side, and a mildly decreased postural reflex [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III score, 29; Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5]. He did not have any behavioral or psychiatric problems, cognitive impairment (score on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination score of 30/30), or autonomic dysfunction. His parkinsonism responded well to a dopamine agonist and his condition improved considerable under that treatment (UPDRS part III score, 14; Hoehn and Yahr stage 2). \n\nAt the age of 51, mild cerebellar dysfunction including dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia of both hands developed and additional movements such as dystonic posture of the right arm and leg during gait and unusual oscillatory up and down movement of the trunk, which occurred irrespective of medications, were observed. Brain MRI was performed to evaluate the unexpected, additional movement, and it revealed mild cerebellar atrophy ( ). Molecular genetic analysis identified a combined 103 CTA/CTG expansion on 13q21. Genetic studies of other ataxia loci, including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and Huntington's disease (HD) revealed no abnormalities. Positron-emission tomography using  F-  N  -(3-fluoropropyl)-2\u03b2-carbonethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) revealed reduced FP-CIT binding in the bilateral posterior putamen ( ). During medical treatment the patient's disability had not progressed, his activities of daily living were not affected, and dysautonomia had not developed. The patient remained successfully treated with dopamine agonist monotherapy at the last follow-up (when aged 52 years). \n\nThe older brother of the proband (II: 1) ( ) experienced dragging of his left leg at the age of 33 years and was consequently diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in another hospital. He showed good levodopa response, but his symptoms progressed slowly. A neurologic examination at our clinic at the age of 59 years revealed rigidity and bradykinesia in the left side, mild gait ataxia with widened base, and impaired tandem gait (UPDRS part III score, 21; Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5). Additionally, unusual oscillatory movements of the neck and trunk from side to side were observed, which were not affected by medication. Although 26 years had passed since the onset of symptom, he showed favorable course without motor fluctuation, impairment of activities of daily living and autonomic dysfunction. He declined further genetic or imaging studies and was referred back to his prior hospital. \n\n\n### Family B \n  \nA 65-year-old, right-handed man (II: 5) ( ) initially presented with a 5-year history of dysarthria. Dysarthria was slowly progressive and he became unintelligible at the age of 63, but he did not feel any other unwellness. However, dysphagia, dyspnea, generalized weakness, and weight loss (18 kg over 2 years) developed and progressed slowly during the 6 months before his initial visit to our clinic. He denied a history of drug or toxin exposure, trauma, or other medical problems, but had a family history of a deceased brother (II: 3) ( ) who had previously been diagnosed with SCA8 with typical cerebellar ataxia by genetic sequencing at our clinic (combined 81 CTA/CTG expansion). He exhibited generalized muscle atrophy including tongue and intrinsic hand muscles. Neurological examination revealed flaccid-type dysarthria and muscle tone, facial diplegia, generalized muscle wasting and weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4), fasciculation in the tongue and thigh, and increased jaw and knee jerk without sensory disturbance and pathologic reflex. He showed unsteady gait, but it was difficult to determine whether unsteadiness was due to generalized weakness or cerebellar dysfunction. Video-oculography revealed vertical nystagmus during the head positional and shaking test. Nerve conduction test revealed no abnormal results, but electromyography revealed widespread denervation in the tongue, all levels of the trunk, and both the upper and lower extremities. Brain MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy ( ). Genetic analysis identified a combined 86 CTA/CTG expansion on 13q21. Genetic studies for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, DRPLA, superoxide dismutase for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and androgen receptor gene mutation for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy revealed no abnormalities. Although he started to take riluzole, rapid progression of dysphagia and respiratory muscle weakness resulted in aspiration pneumonia and dyspnea. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe clinical presentation of SCA8-positive patients is characterized by cerebellar ataxia of varying severity, occurring alone or with other features. However, the recent accumulation of cases with atypical phenotype is making it apparent that the clinical presentation of SCA8 is variable, and no constellation of symptoms with predictive diagnostic value has been conclusively identified. There have been no reports of SCA8 patients in whom the disease mimics good dopaminergic treatment-responsive parkinsonism and ALS, and the clinical phenotypes of our cases are unusual compared with other reports of nonataxic phenotypes of SCA8. \n\n### Parkinsonism with good response to dopaminergic treatment \n  \nIn family A, II: 3 expressed asymmetric parkinsonian phenotype that included rigidity, bradykinesia and gait disturbance and showed good and sustained response to dopaminergic treatment initially. However, additional movement including dystonic gait, unusual oscillatory movement of trunk, and mild cerebellar ataxia developed later. He had a family history in his older brother (II: 1) who showed similar combined symptoms. The older brother (II: 1) in particular showed benign disease course for 26 years and it was not compatible with typical nature of IPD. Although both of these patients developed mild cerebellar ataxia later in the course of their disease, there was no evidence of multiple system atrophy (MSA), such as dysautonomia. Although atypical parkinsonism was reported as a phenomenology of SCA8, it was associated with a poor response to levodopa, with additional features implying corticobasal degeneration  or MSA.  Given the clinical profiles of the benign course and the family history of similar combined movements, dopaminergic treatment-responsive parkinsonism as an atypical phenotype of SCA8 is more plausible than an incidental detection or coexistence of CTG repeat expansion in these patients. \n\n\n### Coexistence of upper and lower motor neuron signs mimicking probable ALS \n  \nIn family B, II: 5 presented as probable ALS with combined lower and upper motor neuron signs and mild cerebellar dysfunction. Motor neuron disease has been described as accompanied with SCA2,  SCA6  and recently detected SCA36,  but never with SCA8. This patient had cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI and exhibited vertical nystagmus during the head positional and shaking test, implying cerebellar dysfunction. Furthermore, his family history included his brother having typical cerebellar ataxia and genetic confirmation. Although the possibility of a rare coincidental association between SCA8 and sporadic motor neuron disease cannot be excluded, the clinical manifestation mimicking motor neuron disease has not previously been reported as an atypical phenotype of SCA8 to our knowledge. \n\n\n### Clinical heterogeneity and possible pathogenic mechanism of SCA8 \n  \nThe unusual symptomatology of SCA8 presenting as nonataxic phenotype has been described previously in the literature ( ). Furthermore, rare coexistence or incidental detection of the ataxin 8 gene repeat expansion has been observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as MSA, HD, ,  and Alzheimer's disease,  and in ataxias such as SCA1,  SCA2,  SCA6,  16q-linked autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, and Friedreich's ataxia. \n\nIt is generally assumed that the cerebellum is the most vulnerable region of the brain in SCA disease states. The SCA8 transcript has been reported to down-regulate Kelch-like protein 1 (KLHL1) expression through an antisense mechanism, leading to SCA8 neuropathogenesis. -  Chen et al.  demonstrated that the expression profile of KLHL1 overlaps with the brain areas affected in SCA8. Interestingly, expression of KLHL1 was widely distributed throughout the brain, mainly in the Purkinje cell layer of cerebellar cortex, but also highly distributed in motor-related regions including striatum, substantia nigra, pyramidal tract, spinal cord, and cognition-related areas including the hippocampus and lateral entorhinal cortex. These findings imply the existence of other potentially vulnerable regions that have yet to be characterized in SCA8 brains. It leads to the hypothesis that mutation of the SCA8 might affect neurons other than the cerebellum, and hence, the diverse phenotypes would be seen with SCA8. We demonstrated decreased uptake of FP-CIT in bilateral posterior putamen by imaging techniques and detected combined upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in SCA8 patients. These support the nigrostriatal pathway and pyramidal tract as possible affected sites in SCA8. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings of our cases suggest that mutation of the SCA8 locus affect neurons other than the cerebellum and lead to non-ataxic phenotypes. Non-ataxic phenotype and its heterogeneity can make the diagnosis of SCA8 challenging and confuse clinicians when considering SCA8, and indicate the need for genetic testing in the appropriate context. We might consider SCA8 as a possible diagnosis in patients with complex non-ataxic clinical manifestation when family history is detected or cerebellar dysfunction develops later. The study of larger kindred and clues on the SCA8 biological function will help to better understand the pathogenic role of SCA8 alleles and the clinical diversity of the disease. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3840139, "text_md5": "3fa50d1a00390798fabeae9a28600ae0", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 83], "journal": [84, 97], "publication_year": [99, 103], "title": [114, 205], "keywords": [219, 327], "abstract": [340, 1524], "body": [1533, 14404]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24285970, "doi": "10.3988/jcn.2013.9.4.274", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840139", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3840139"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840139\">3840139</a>", "list_title": "PMC3840139  Non-Ataxic Phenotypes of SCA8 Mimicking Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson Disease"}

The misdiagnosis is even higher when only the initial diagnosis is considered, since the diagnostic accuracy improves by time, during follow-up visits. Given that the confirmation of the diagnosis of PD can be only obtained through neuropathology, to improve and facilitate the diagnostic\u2013therapeutic workup in PD, a number of criteria and guidelines have been introduced in the last three decades. In the present paper, we will critically re-appraise the main diagnostic criteria proposed for PD, with particular attention to the recently published criteria by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) task force, underlying their novelty and focusing on the diagnostic issues still open. We also emphasize that the MDS-PD criteria encompass the two main previous sets of diagnostic criteria (United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank and Gelb\u2019s criteria), introducing at the same time new aspects as the use of non-motor symptoms as additional diagnostic features, and the adoption of the concept of prodromal PD, crucial to enroll in clinical trials PD patients in the very early phase of the disease. To better understand the real diffusion of the new MDS-PD diagnostic criteria among neurologists, we have also collected selective opinions of sixteen movement disorder experts from various world regions on their practical approach for the clinical diagnosis of PD. Results from this brief survey showed that, although innovative and complete, the revised diagnostic criteria produced by MDS task force are still scarcely employed among clinicians. We believe that both national and international scientific societies should operate in the future for a broader diffusion of these criteria with specific initiatives, including dedicated events and teaching courses. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn the early 19th century, James Parkinson published his essay on \u201cThe Shaking Palsy,\u201d in which he described in detail the clinical features (tremor, flexed posture, and festination) of a new disease with an insidious onset and a progressive disabling course called   paralysis agitans  ; he was inspired by the observation of various people he noted around the streets of London, all sharing these distinctive physical features ( ,  ). A few decades later, Jean-Martin Charcot in Paris first proposed the eponym of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) for this disorder, adding extensive details to Parkinson\u2019s observations and identifying bradykinesia and rigidity as key features of the disease, while considering tremor as a typical, but not a mandatory diagnostic feature ( ). The diagnosis of PD remains still today a clinical one, and differently from the held belief that detecting PD might be straightforward ( ), clinicopathological studies have shown that up one-fourth of patients diagnosed as idiopathic PD during life have a \u201cparkinsonian syndrome\u201d due to an alternative cause (i.e., atypical parkinsonism, Alzheimer-type pathology, or vascular changes) ( ). The misdiagnosis rate is higher when only the initial diagnosis is considered ( \u2013 ). Conversely, diagnostic accuracy improves during follow-up, with a continuous diagnostic re-evaluation process, when the positive predictive value (PPV) of the last clinical diagnosis prior to death, compared to the autopsy may approach 100% ( ). \n\nGiven that the confirmation of the diagnosis of PD can only be obtained through neuropathology, to improve and facilitate the diagnostic\u2013therapeutic workup in PD, a number of diagnostic criteria or guidelines (in the US the term practice parameters is also used) have been introduced in the last three decades. Diagnostic criteria provide guidance to clinicians on the specific signs, symptoms, or test results that indicate the presence of an illness, in order to classify patients into diagnostic categories facilitating communication among health professionals. Indeed until the late 1980s, no formal diagnostic criteria for PD were available; at that time different retrospective autoptic studies demonstrated that using only clinical diagnosis without applying formal criteria, the diagnostic accuracy was as low as ~75% ( ). During the following years, the application of the diagnostic criteria proposed for PD improved diagnostic accuracy up to 82% ( \u2013 ), leaving, however, many unsolved diagnostic challenges. At the same time, different efforts have been employed to draw clinical diagnostic batteries for probable PD and its differential diagnoses, by employing several combined tests including motor function, olfaction, and mood evaluation ( ,  ). However, although well designed (with high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating healthy subjects from PD), these diagnostic tests had some intrinsic limitations, due to the absence of ante-mortem \u201cgold standard\u201d other than the opinion of \u201cmovement disorder specialists,\u201d to establish the correct diagnosis ( ,  ). \n\nThe concept of producing guidelines has eventually become popular. Guidelines should provide comprehensive recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with a given disorder and are usually developed by a task force of experts convened by an established scientific society who perform a systematic review of all published evidence on the topic. In this view, the collaborative European Federation of Neurological Societies/Movement Disorders Society-European Section (EFNS/MDS-ES) task force produced initially therapeutic ( ,  ) and then diagnostic ( ) extensive guidelines for PD among others. The members of this task force reviewed the most relevant publications regarding clinical and laboratory identification of PD, giving specific recommendations to improve the clinical diagnosis ( ) still mainly based on United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria (UKPDSBB) ( ). \n\nConversely, practice parameters are particular kind of succinct guidelines designed to assist clinicians in providing high-quality assessment and treatment that is consistent with the best available scientific evidence and clinical consensus. The parameters describe generally accepted practices but are not intended to clearly define a standard of care; according to practice parameters, the ultimate judgment regarding the care of a patient is up to the clinician in light of all the clinical evidence on the diagnostic and treatment options. Those published on the diagnosis of PD by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) ( ) represent a good example of how practice parameters address gaps between clinical practice and existing evidence on a given topic ( ). Neurologists, patients, and caregivers should keep in mind that the recommendations of the AAN practice parameters are made on the basis of the available pieces of evidence and when good-quality proofs are scarce, direct conclusions are not easily drawn ( ). Regarding diffusion among different countries, practice parameters are mainly used in the US, perhaps with the recondite aim to reduce the clinician\u2019s legal responsibilities. \n\nIn the present paper, we will critically re-appraise the different diagnostic criteria proposed for PD with particular attention to the recently published International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) diagnostic criteria ( ), underlying their novelty and focusing on the diagnostic problems still open. In, addition, we performed an international audit by asking to sixteen movement disorder experts from all over the world, their practical approach toward the clinical diagnosis of PD and their attitude regarding the application of the new criteria. \n\n\n## Diagnostic Accuracy of Different Sets of Criteria \n  \n### From the UKPDSBB to the Gelb Diagnostic Criteria \n  \nThe United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) represented the first formal diagnostic criteria proposed for PD ( ). They consist of a three-step process: step 1 referring to the diagnosis of a parkinsonian syndrome, step 2 referring to exclusion criteria for PD, and step 3 referring to the prospective supportive criteria for PD ( ). In step 1, to allow the clinical diagnosis of a parkinsonian syndrome, bradykinesia plus at least one other sign among muscular rigidity, (4\u20136\u2009Hz) rest tremor, and postural instability are required. In addition (step 2), all secondary causes of a parkinsonian syndrome including history of repeated strokes or head injury with stepwise progression of parkinsonian features, history of definite encephalitis, oculogyric crises, neuroleptic treatment at onset of symptoms, familial history, unilateral features after 3\u2009years, supranuclear gaze palsy, cerebellar signs, early severe autonomic involvement or dementia, unexplained Babinski sign, presence of a secondary cause on imaging, negative response to levodopa and exposure to toxic agents should be excluded ( ). Finally (step 3), three or more supportive features among unilateral onset, rest tremor, progression of the disorder, persistent asymmetry, excellent response to levodopa (70\u2013100%), severe levodopa-induced chorea, levodopa response for 5\u2009years or more and clinical course of at least 10\u2009years, should be present ( ). According to the UKPDSBB criteria, bradykinesia is the core feature of PD; the clinical spectrum of bradykinesia is quite complex involving not only true bradykinesia (literally \u201cslowness of movement\u201d), but also hypokinesia (literally \u201cless or paucity of movements,\u201d usually employed to indicate decreased amplitude of movements), and akinesia (general lack of movement, including associated and automatic movements). To date, there is a general consensus to use the term bradykinesia to indicate the slowness of initiation of voluntary movement associated with progressive reduction in the speed of repetitive actions ( ): using this operational definition, bradykinesia seen in parkinsonism is well differentiated by the pseudo-bradykinesia observed in mimics of parkinsonism (i.e., hypothyroid slowness, dystonia, holding tics, catatonia, and stiff person syndrome). \n\nMore than 10\u2009years later, Gelb and other American co-authors ( ) published a new set of diagnostic criteria. According to their proposal, the diagnosis of PD requires the presence of at least two cardinal features among rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity or unilateral onset. In addition, other causes indicated by the presence of early (within 3\u2009years) postural instability, freezing phenomena or hallucinations unrelated to medications, dementia preceding motor symptoms in the first year, supranuclear gaze palsy, severe dysautonomia, documentation of a condition known to produce parkinsonism (focal brain lesions or neuroleptic use within the previous 6\u2009months), should be excluded ( ); the criterion of a considerable and sustained levodopa response is also required ( ). Unlike UKPDSBB criteria, Gelb criteria were based on different levels of diagnostic confidence, an approach previously proposed in two sets of criteria, which gained very little diffusion, i.e., Calne et al. criteria ( ) and Larsen et al. criteria ( ), both suggesting three categories: clinically possible, clinically probable, and clinically definite PD. Gelb and colleagues identified only two clinical diagnostic levels of certainty, a possible and a probable one based on a temporal criterion of symptoms onset; they left the definite diagnosis only when histopathologic confirmation of PD was obtained at autopsy. The most important criticism regarding Gelb criteria is that bradykinesia is not considered an essential feature for diagnosis of PD, whereas this criterion is now considered the most important one in identifying parkinsonism by most of the international experts. \n\nOnly one study directly compared sensitivity, specificity, PPV, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of UKPDSBB and Gelb criteria with a definite diagnosis of PD (i.e., using postmortem studies) ( ). Diagnostic PPV and NPV were similar in UKPDSBB (92% for PPV and 25% for NPV) and Gelb criteria for possible and probable PD (93% for PPV and 14% for NPV), while specificity was low in both criteria (30\u201340%). Sensitivity was higher in UKPDSBB (90%) and Gelb criteria for possible PD (87%) compared to Gelb criteria for probable PD (72%). Global accuracy was 84% for UKPDSBB criteria, 82% for Gelb criteria for possible PD, and 69% for Gelb criteria for probable PD ( ,  ), with a high number of false positive and false negative cases. In addition, two detailed systematic reviews on the diagnosis of PD carried out in Scotland ( ), and Italy ( ) were unable to find comparative studies between the two diagnostic criteria and diagnoses of expert clinicians, except for the above-mentioned study by Hughes et al. ( ) in which it was only possible to compare PPV (90% for clinical diagnosis versus 92\u201393% for the two sets of diagnostic criteria). However, a more recent meta-analysis ( ) indicated that the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis by an expert is similar (83.9%) to UKPDSBB criteria (82.7%), with a lower sensitivity (81.3 versus 90.8%), but higher specificity (83.5 versus 34%). \n\nConcerning the diffusion of the different criteria, the UKPDSBB criteria have been widely employed in both clinical trials and routine clinical practice around the world, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, only a small number of clinical studies (mainly carried out in the US and in Scandinavia) have adopted Gelb criteria ( \u2013 ), somehow justifying their more limited diffusion among practicing clinicians. Calne criteria and Larsen criteria have been used even less. \n\nDuring the routine use of these two sets of criteria (UKPDSBB and Gelb criteria) spanning for more than two decades, most researchers and clinicians have found several significant limitations ( ,  ,  ). First, both criteria focus only on motor features whereas it is now widely accepted that PD is associated with numerous non-motor features more or less responsive to levodopa, including sleep disturbances, mood disorders, autonomic failure, sensory problems, and cognitive impairment. Above all, cognitive impairment is fairly common in PD but, according to the UKPDSBB and Gelb criteria, it might challenge a clinical diagnosis of PD if severe enough to configure dementia within the first year of motor symptom onset. In this case, cognitive impairment becomes an exclusion criterion for PD leading to an alternative diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) ( ,  ). However, the reciprocally exclusive relationship between DLB and PD-dementia remains very controversial, since both disorders present with parkinsonism and dementia, and both are Lewy body disorders and synucleinopathies, leading several experts to think that they should be considered on a spectrum of the same disorder ( ,  ). Another noticeable pitfall of UKPDSBB is the idea that genetic risk factors (more than one relative affected by PD) challenge the diagnosis of PD ( ), concept not anymore acceptable nowadays. \n\n\n### Rationale and Construct of the MDS-PD Criteria \n  \nIn this view, in 2015 the   ad hoc   MDS task force proposed new clinical diagnostic criteria for PD (called the MDS-PD criteria) ( ). These criteria were specifically designed for use in research, but they also might be adopted as a general guide to the clinical diagnosis of PD in a routine setting ( ). Examination of all cardinal manifestations should be carried out as described in the MDS-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) ( ). In the MDS-PD criteria, the classical signs of the motor syndrome remain the core features of the disease. The essential criterion is the presence of parkinsonism, which is defined as bradykinesia, in combination with at least one between rest tremor (4\u20136\u2009Hz) and rigidity ( ). However, many non-motor manifestations, often dominating the clinical presentation of the disease, have now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria ( ). Based on the assumption that the pathological process of PD may begin in non-dopaminergic structures of the brain or peripheral nervous system, a new diagnostic category has been configured, prodromal PD ( ): prodromal PD is considered to represent a true initial stage of PD ( ). \n\nThe MDS-PD criteria include a three-step process for PD diagnosis. First, parkinsonism is defined and, if the criteria are not met (step 1), prodromal PD or non-clinical PD could then be considered (in addition to other non-parkinsonian tremulous conditions, such as essential or dystonic tremor). Once parkinsonism is diagnosed, the criteria then define whether this is attributable to PD, i.e., when absolute exclusion criteria (step 2) are absent and red flags are balanced by supportive features (step 3) (Table  ). Two levels of certainty are proposed: the diagnosis of clinically established PD requires the absence of absolute exclusion criteria, at least two supportive criteria, and no red flags. When these conditions are satisfied, the expected result is that the large majority of the screened subjects (at least 90%) will have PD, although many true PD cases will not meet this certainty level ( ). Differently, the diagnosis of clinically probable PD requires the absence of absolute exclusion criteria, while the presence of red flags is admitted, but this should be counterbalanced by supportive criteria ( ). If one red flag is present, there must also be at least one supportive criterion; if two red flags are present, at least two supportive criteria are needed. No more than two red flags are allowed for this category ( ). When these conditions are satisfied, the expected result is that at least 80% of patients diagnosed as probable PD truly have PD, but also that 80% of true PD cases are identified ( ). Alternatively, if these conditions are not satisfied, clinical PD should not be diagnosed. \n  \nSupportive criteria, absolute exclusion criteria, and red flags for the diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to the revised International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS-PD) diagnostic criteria [Postuma et al. ( )]. \n  \n Licensed by Wiley (License number 4167160336642)  . \n  \nGiven that PD diagnosis is generally clinically based, the MDS-PD criteria are designed to be broadly applicable without the need for ancillary diagnostic testing, although a supportive diagnostic role for these tests is for the first time allowed. Ancillary tests that were included in the criteria include those aimed to document olfactory loss (in the anosmic or clearly hyposmic range, adjusted for age and sex), and cardiac sympathetic denervation as shown by abnormal Metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ( ). To be included in the new diagnostic panel, the laboratory marker must have been demonstrated to provide more than 80% specificity in differentiating PD from other parkinsonian conditions, with a minimum of three positive studies from different centers ( ). Conversely, among absolute exclusion criteria (Table  ) it is included a normal functional neuroimaging of the presynaptic dopaminergic system. This criterion does not imply that dopaminergic functional imaging is required for diagnosis (nor does the task force wish to imply that this should be routinely performed in diagnosing PD), and if no imaging has been performed, this criterion does not apply ( ). To this regard, the new criteria do not leave any more room for the overused term \u201cSWEDD\u201d (i.e., scans without evidence for dopaminergic deficit) to be considered as PD. The currently leading concept is that while an abnormal dopaminergic imaging might suggest clinical or even prodromal PD (for further details, see the paragraph on prodromal PD), a normal dopaminergic imaging unlikely reflects a single clinical entity ( ). \n\nAs a further consideration, the MDS-PD task force left a loophole to the expert evaluating physician: they stated that PD can still be excluded \u201c\u2026\u2009when the documentation of an alternative condition known to produce parkinsonism and plausibly connected to the patient\u2019s symptoms is more likely than PD.\u201d This criterion includes not only rare conditions that can mimic PD, but also the more common degenerative parkinsonian syndromes mimicking PD [multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration]. Of note is that DLB is not considered an alternative parkinsonian syndrome according to this criterion, given that the MDS-PD criteria do not take into account dementia as an exclusion criterion for PD. Hence, according to MDS-PD criteria and fully in line with the new consensus criteria for DLB ( ), for those patients with dementia previously diagnosed as DLB, the diagnosis could be labeled as \u201cPD-DLB subtype.\u201d Unsurprisingly, this recommendation is creating a heated debate in the scientific community ( ,  ). A final consideration regarding non-motor features is that MDS-PD criteria are more permissive about the presence of autonomic dysfunction in comparison to the UKPDSBB criteria; they consider severe autonomic dysfunction as a red flag for MSA, only when occurring in the first five years of -disease ( ). \n\nTable   provides a brief synopsis reporting the main features of the different diagnostic criteria and guidelines developed to improve the diagnosis of PD. \n  \nSynopsis of the main diagnostic criteria proposed for Parkinson\u2019s disease, in terms of methodology, size, and relative diffusion. \n  \n Type of study:  single- or multi-expert opinion;  Single center clinicopathological study;  Systematic review  . \n\n EFNS/MDS-ES, European Federation of Neurological Societies/Movement Disorders Society-European Section; UKPDSBB, United Kingdom Parkinson\u2019s disease society brain bank clinical diagnostic criteria; MDS, Movement Disorder Society  . \n  \n\n\n## MDS-PD Criteria: Open Issues \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease is classically defined as a distinct clinical entity responsive to dopaminergic therapies, and this therapeutic response has been used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. More recently, many aspects changed, with the expansion of clinical phenomenology and improved understanding of genetic and environmental features that might influence the pathophysiology of the disease at molecular and cellular level ( ,  ). Our concept of PD probably need to be expanded to include new clinical syndromes, and in fact, the variability within patients defined as having PD may prompt to identify subgroups sharing discrete clinical, genetic, pathological, and neuroimaging features. In this view, the term \u201csynucleinopathies\u201d is a useful disease concept that includes some parkinsonian syndromes not currently defined as idiopathic PD (as DLB and MSA), but excludes some others that may meet clinical PD criteria (as the parkinsonian syndrome associated with parkin mutations), but have different pathophysiology ( ,  ). Others have advocated using the term Lewy body disorders ( ): the concept of Lewy body disorders would include DLB, Lewy body PD, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder (REM SBD) and pure autonomic failure, conditions all related to Lewy body pathology ( ). Although these are clinically separate entities, the common occurrence of Lewy pathology suggests that they could respond to similar therapies. In sum, a hierarchical classification could be based on different layers as protein pathological deposition (i.e., synucleinopathies including PD, DLB, REM SBD, pure autonomic failure, MSA), type of cellular inclusions (i.e., Lewy body disorders including PD, DLB, REM SBD, and pure autonomic failure) and clinicopathological phenotype (i.e., motor-predominant Lewy body disorder including PD) ( ). \n\nGiven these postulations, a first possible concern on the MDS-PD criteria is that they are still based on the assumption of PD as a single clinicopathological entity. Conversely, several experts have argued in favor of classifying PD in different subtypes ( \u2013 ). As an example, Fereshtehnejad and coworkers ( ) have very recently proposed a clinical method for subtyping PD cases on an individual basis, with implications for better patient stratification to be used for personalized medicine. In particular, they investigated a large group of   de novo   PD patients diagnosed according to the current criteria and belonging to a longitudinal international multicenter database. In this study, the authors differentiated three distinct groups of PD patients suggesting that these subtypes differ biologically and in their natural history: a first \u201cmild motor-predominant\u201d group with minor motor and non-motor impairment; a second \u201cdiffuse malignant\u201d group with a severe motor and non-motor impairment; and the third group with intermediate features. However, this classification has some limitations. First, it might be only applied on a cohort of   de novo   patients, which is not what routinely seen in clinical practice. Second, these subtypes have not been yet validated by other studies and, third, PD subtypes or clusters cannot be used as a final classification system. Fourth, probably most important in terms of precision medicine is the raising concept of moving away from clinically derived to biomarker-driven subtypes of PD ( ). In particular, PD might be considered as a group of disorders that, while related by common dopamine-neuron degeneration, exhibit unique genetic, biological, and molecular abnormalities, which may respond differentially to a given therapeutic approach ( ). Following this model, only biomarker-defined, homogenous subtypes of PD might respond to therapies proven to affect the biological processes within each subtype ( ). \n\nAnother potential issue involves a still neglected subtype of PD that could possibly not be further considered as idiopathic PD using the current criteria: the so-called benign tremulous parkinsonism. This has been considered a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by tremor predominance with a no more than mild progression, except for tremor, and often scarce response of tremor symptomatology to dopaminergic therapy ( ); this phenotype in terms of natural history and disability is fairly different from classical PD. Data on the prevalence and the neuropathology of benign tremulous parkinsonism are scarce, but suggest that a portion of these patients (24%) may actually have a non-parkinsonian tremor, as essential or dystonic tremor, since they may not show significant nigral pathology at postmortem examination ( ). The identification of these patients in clinical trials looking at possible neuroprotective agents for PD may be critical, since the unbalanced distribution of cases with different natural disease history in treatment groups would alter the trial outcomes. At the moment, the issues of correctly classifying difficult tremulous patients for inclusion in clinical trials might be best addressed by using dopaminergic functional neuroimaging. \n\nThe same authors of the MDS-PD criteria ( ,  ,  ) underline that a priority task for future research should be to develop a clinical subtype classification and to establish models that satisfy the complexity of early non-motor symptoms such as dementia, taking into consideration controversies to this regard. To do so, imaging and biochemical markers would help to improve diagnostic accuracy and would constitute a bridging element between all clinical, genetic, and ultimately pathological aspects (essential for the diagnostic validation). Priority tasks will be the development of techniques able to detect the pathologic brain \u03b1-synuclein deposits using novel imaging brain ligands or searching for extracerebral phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein, e.g., by utilizing skin biopsy ( ,  \u2013 ). \n\n### The Perilous Concept of Prodromal PD \n  \nAnother critical issue is the need to better identify early PD patients to be included in novel neuroprotective trials testing disease-modifying agents. The robust pathological evidence provided by Braak et al. ( ) of a slowly progressive/spreading neurodegenerative process, starting from olfactory bulb toward the neocortex throughout the brainstem, suggested the concept of pre- and paucisymptomatic stages of PD, in which early dysfunction of olfactory bulb or brainstem could be detected. Accordingly, it has been proposed that early PD could be divided into three stages: preclinical PD in which the neurodegenerative process is started, without evident symptoms or signs of the disease; prodromal PD in which symptoms and signs of this disease are present, but insufficient to define a full clinical picture of PD; and clinical PD in which the diagnosis of PD is achieved, based on the presence of classical motor signs (according to MDS-PD criteria) ( ,  ,  ). At this purpose, in addition to the criteria for the diagnosis of clinical PD, the MDS task force developed specific research criteria for prodromal PD ( ). Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but a clinical diagnosis is not yet possible. These criteria, which have been developed for research purposes only, include a combination of markers (here the term marker refers to any disease indicator, whether a symptom, sign, or biomarker) ranging from mild motor symptoms [i.e., UPDRS\u20141987 version ( ) score\u2009\u2265\u20093 excluding action tremor; or MDS-UPDRS score\u2009>\u20096 excluding postural-action tremor], non-motor symptoms (i.e., REM SBD, olfactory dysfunction, constipation, excessive daytime somnolence, symptomatic hypotension, erectile/urinary dysfunction, depression), and ancillary diagnostic tests (i.e., abnormal tracer uptake of the presynaptic dopaminergic system: SPECT or positron emission tomography) ( ). These criteria represent only a first step in the correct description of early stages of PD, and will require constant updating as more information becomes available ( ). \n\nAn inherent limitation of this proposal is that markers cannot be combined if they are not independent; as a consequence, no new information is added by identifying two or more markers in the same person ( ,  ,  ,  ). As a matter of fact, it is very challenging to determine whether markers are truly independent and this issue has created an animated discussion in the scientific community. A study by Chen and colleagues in 2014 first suggested that the presence of multiple non-motor symptoms in the same person is uncommon in the general population ( ). It is indeed difficult to think of a highly prevalent underlying pathology other than prodromal PD in which a person would have combined two or more markers ( ). A large longitudinal investigation (HPRO-PD), looking at prodromal PD among participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, has investigated the association of markers as probable REM SBD, constipation, and hyposmia with PD. While constipation, REM SBD and hyposmia are common when considered individually, as expected, their co-occurrence was found to be rare in individuals without PD ( ). Again, Fereshtehnejad et al. ( ) have investigated in a REM SBD cohort the independence of markers to predict conversion to PD or DLB suggesting that the prodromal criteria could assess with high sensitivity and specificity conversion time and incidence of PD/DLB. More recently, Pilotto et al. ( ), when exploring the reliability of MDS research criteria for prodromal PD in diverse prospective cohorts, observed that most patients would not meet the criteria before diagnosis unless testing is performed with specific objective markers (as dopamine imaging and polysomnography to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of probable prodromal PD). Fully in line with these results, researchers from the US PARS study ( ) have investigated whether the combination of smell identification testing followed by dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging can identify individuals from the general population at risk for conversion to a clinical diagnosis of PD, concluding that the combination of hyposmia and DAT deficit was highly predictive of conversion to PD within 4\u2009years of clinical follow-up. \n\nBased on these data, prodromal PD criteria represent a promising tool for research purposes, to better investigate the possible risk to develop PD in presymptomatic patients. However, future methods to detect prodromal PD likely will require a multivariate hierarchical approach, and its power will depend on accessing markers over multiple possibly independent domains, such as genetic features, motor and non-motor symptoms, and ancillary diagnostic tests ( ). Nonetheless, further investigations are requested to better understand the effective role of the different markers in research studies, such as those which have been recently conducted in REM SBD patients in order to identify new potential \u03b1-synuclein biomarkers ( ,  ). \n\n\n\n## Brief Survey among Movement Disorder Experts \n  \nTo better understand the   real world   diffusion of the new MDS-PD diagnostic criteria, we conducted an international survey by asking to sixteen senior movement disorders experts (all regular speakers at international congresses, but not authors of the new criteria) their practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of PD, and whether they have applied the new criteria in their daily practice. The experts were based in Europe (  n  \u2009=\u20099), North America (  n  \u2009=\u20092), Asia (  n  \u2009=\u20092), and Australia (  n  \u2009=\u20093). The survey was conducted by email and consisted of two straightforward questions: (1) \u201cDo you think the new MDS-PD criteria are useful in clinical practice?\u201d (2) \u201cHow much do you think are they different from previous diagnostic criteria?\u201d And a third \u201cprovocative\u201d question: (3) \u201cHas in your opinion this story of the prodromal symptoms gone too far?\u201d (Figure  ). Interestingly, among the sixteen experts consulted, only five answered affirmatively to the first question, one colleague did not answer because he did not know in details the new criteria, and the other ten considered the new MDS-PD criteria not so valuable in the clinical setting. Again, when answering to the second question, eight colleagues considered these criteria quite similar to the previous UKPDSBB criteria, two colleagues considered these criteria too complex and artificial, two colleagues did not answer directly at this question and only the remaining four considered the new criteria to represent a real improvement, particularly for the attention given to the role of non-motor features of PD. When asked to the last challenging question, three experts did not answer directly and the other thirteen were fundamentally skeptical. In particular, although it is well known that the prodromal criteria have been clearly developed for research purpose only, they argued that a possible misuse of these criteria could lead to the amplification of the role of prodromal symptoms also in a routine clinical setting, stating that the best approach is to clinically monitor subjects at risk for PD with annual or biannual visits. In addition, when asked to add some other comments or observations about the new MDS criteria, three colleagues expressed a distinctly positive opinion for the introduction of \u201cred flags\u201d and of supportive criteria (\u201cgreen flags\u201d), underscoring the possible benefit for research and future neuroprotective trials. A few of them expressed their disappointment toward the inclusion of \u201cnormal functional neuroimaging of the presynaptic dopaminergic system\u201d as an absolute exclusion criterion (given that low-quality dopaminergic imaging might result negative also in early PD patients); others felt that the MDS criteria suffer from excessive sketchiness (referring to the concept that \u201cthe number of red flags should be equal to, or less than, the number of supportive criteria\u201d for probable PD). In sum, they argued that the basic criteria for diagnosis (i.e., levodopa response with no \u201cred flags\u201d) should still remain the crucial part of the \u201ccore\u201d diagnostic criteria initially, no matter how clinicians wish to modify the other criteria or add on more clarifications to the criteria (Figure  ). \n  \nSchematic representation of the three questions posed to the movement disorder experts during the brief survey. \n    \nSchematic representation of the senior movement disorder experts\u2019 answers to the three questions of the brief survey. Legend: Y, yes; N, no; NA, not available. \n  \nThis informal brief survey provides current simple information about \u201creal-life\u201d differences in the approach to the clinical diagnosis of PD among clinicians. Possible limitations of the here reported international audit consist the restricted number of participants and that only experts not directly involved in the production of the criteria have been interviewed, configuring a possible negative bias. In summary, we suggest that the diffusion of the new criteria should be better implemented not only among general neurologists, but also among movement disorders specialists. Although the revised MDS-PD criteria have been published since 2015, many colleagues do not apply these criteria in routine clinical practice because of scarce knowledge and probably also for some prejudices. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nSince the first description of PD two centuries ago, our understanding of this disorder has increased at different levels, from a more accurate definition of its clinical features and pathophysiological mechanisms, to the characterization of its neuropathological hallmarks necessary for the diagnostic confirmation ( ). To do so, a great contribution was achieved through the introduction of UKPDSBB criteria, that represent a relatively simple tool to increase the accuracy of diagnosis; the Gelb criteria deserve, however, the merit to have introduced the distinction between a possible and a probable diagnosis of PD. The recent MDS-PD criteria encompass the two previous sets of criteria introducing also new important aspects as the use of non-motor symptoms as possible diagnostic features and the adoption of the concept of prodromal PD, fundamental for research studies (to correctly enroll early PD patients in future trials). We emphasize that, although innovative and complete, the MDS-PD criteria still lack of the pathological validation and are scarcely employed among clinicians, so far. We think that both national and international scientific societies should operate in the future for a broader diffusion of these criteria with specific initiatives, including dedicated events and teaching courses. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nLM: conception, organization, and execution of the review project; writing, review, and critique of the manuscript.

The purpose of this case report is to introduce a rare case of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with a mild myocardial bridge and a history of WPW. \n\n\n## Patient concerns: \n  \nA 25-year-old man with known WPW syndrome died at night while sleeping. \n\n\n## Diagnoses: \n  \nDiagnosis of WPW syndrome is based on typical electrocardiogram findings with a documented dysrhythmia before the victim's death. \n\n\n## Interventions: \n  \nAt autopsy, no traumatic injury or common poisons were found, only a slight myocardial bridge was detected.

Postmortem genetic examination can assist the diagnosis of sudden cardiac death, especially when no lethal structural abnormality is found in the decedent. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital heart conduction disease characterized by the presence of one or more accessory pathways that predispose the patient to frequent episodes of arrhythmias.  The occurrence of WPW is rarely associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies.  WPW is considered as a benign arrhythmia, but provides a basis for the occurrence of arrhythmias. Patients with WPW syndrome may experience palpitations, dizziness, syncope, congestive heart failure or sudden cardiac death (SCD). In some patients, the first and only manifestation of the disease is SCD.  The ECG features of WPW include a short PR interval of <0.12\u200aseconds, slurring and slow rise of the initial QRS complex (delta wave), a widened QRS complex with a total duration >0.12\u200aseconds, and an abnormal ventricular repolarization.  The ECG finding of pre-excitation is a result of early ventricular depolarization through the accessory pathway. Diagnosis of WPW syndrome is based on typical ECG findings with a documented dysrhythmia. The overall risk of SCD in the WPW syndrome is estimated at 0.1% in asymptomatic patients and 0.3% in symptomatic patients per year.  Familial appearance of WPW syndrome displays an autosomal dominant inheritance. The PRKAG2 gene was identified as a possible susceptibility gene in WPW syndrome.  PRKAG2 encodes the \u03b32 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is an important regulator of cardiac metabolism. \n\nHerein we reported an autopsy case of sudden death at night while sleeping, with a myocardial bridge in left anterior descending coronary artery and a history of WPW. \n\n\n## Case report \n  \n### Case history \n  \nA 25-year-old man was charged with robbery and incarcerated in a prison. One night, his cellmates found the man snoring loudly, cyanotic and unresponsive in bed. They called the prison staff and sent him to the infirmary. He presented with pulseless and cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, but he died. \n\nHis medical records indicated that he had a history of recurrent episodes of palpitation. The symptom occasionally occurred in the past year without obvious cause. It lasted for a few minutes to half an hour and alleviated by itself. The last episode of the symptom was two months ago. The physical examination revealed a normal blood pressure (120/90 mm Hg) and a pulse rate of 160\u200abeats/minute when the symptoms appeared. The 12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG) showed paroxysmal tachycardia and pre-excitation syndrome type B (Fig.  ). He was given symptomatic treatment. \n  \nTwelve-lead ECG after conversion to sinus rhythm. Delta waves were observed in aVR, II, V4, V5, and V6. This ECG is indicative of WPW syndrome type B. WPW\u200a=\u200aWolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome. \n  \n\n### Autopsy and histological findings \n  \nThe man was 172.0\u200acm in height and 59.0\u200akg in weight. No significant injuries were observed on external examination except for a few old scars on the knee. The heart weighed 310\u200ag on examination. The left anterior descending artery was located into the myocardial wall for a distance of 1.5\u200acm and depth was 0.1\u200acm. The coronary artery revealed no atherosclerotic changes. Focal hemorrhage was observed in the right ventricular myocardium. Other organs did not show any remarkable changes. The toxicology analysis revealed no positive findings. \n\n\n### Genetic analysis \n  \nGenomic DNA was isolated from paraffin embedded tissue of the patient and whole exome sequencing was performed to analyze potential genetic variation related to WPW syndrome and SCD. The results showed no exonic mutations in the PRKAG2 gene. Seven potentially pathogenic mutations for SCD, KCNE1, CACNA1C, CASQ2, ANK2, AKAP9, KCNJ5, and TRDN were identified in the patient. The results of the genetic analysis are shown in Table  . \n  \nPredisposing gene analysis of SCD by whole exome sequencing. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present case, a 25-year-old man died during sleep. No significant abnormality was found in organs except for a myocardial bridge. The frequency of myocardial bridge at autopsy is generally high. It is considered to be pathological when the segment of tunnel is 2 to 3\u200acm long and 0.2 to 0.3\u200acm deep.  In this case, myocardial bridge was 1.5\u200acm in length and 0.1\u200acm in depth without atherosclerotic changes in the intramural part, which was insufficient to explain sudden death. The clinical history of tachycardia, palpitation and ventricular pre-excitation, and ECG finding indicated that he had arrhythmic symptoms accompanied by WPW syndrome. Whole exome sequencing identified mutations in some common SCD-related genes. Thus, it was presumed that the cause of death was SCD, although without lethal structural abnormality. Moreover, WPW with arrhythmias accounted for the death. \n\nThe most common arrhythmia in WPW patients is atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, which occurs in 80% of cases. Atrial fibrillation is common, occurring in one-third of patients and is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation is the most common cause of sudden death in WPW patients.  It is difficult to diagnose arrhythmia related sudden death at postmortem without an antemortem electrocardiogram. For establishing the cause of death, other causes must be excluded, and the history of electrocardiographic abnormalities is essential. \n\nPrevious studies have indicated that patients with WPW may suddenly die during sleep.  Risk factors for SCD in patients with WPW syndrome are localization of the accessory pathway, emotional or physical stress, additional cardiac structural abnormalities and accompanying symptoms. Sudden death occurred significantly more often in men than in women.  A proportion of cases have additional structural abnormalities suggesting that the combination of pre-excitation with additional cardiac pathology may render individuals at higher risk of SCD.  In the presented case, a myocardial bridge was found in left anterior descending coronary artery at autopsy. In the presence of the myocardial bridge, myocardial ischemia is more serious when arrhythmias occur. Besides, this concomitant pathology may contribute to atrial fibrillation and result in higher incidence of SCD. Accompanying symptoms such as tiredness, palpitations, syncope or abdominal pains have been considered as alarming signs of sudden death due to WPW syndrome.  The patient in our case presented with pre-excitation combined with palpitations and should be on high alert for signs of SCD. \n\nThe molecular genetics of WPW has been investigated, but only a single gene PRKAG2 was defined to date.  The patient did not carry this mutation. Prior studies have reported that mutations in this gene focused on familial WPW syndrome. Vaughan et al  indicated that unlike familial WPW syndrome, mutation of PRKAG2 is not commonly associated with sporadic WPW syndrome. Further studies are needed to identify the genetic basis of common sporadic WPW syndrome. In the presented case, seven mutations in genes associated with SCD were identified in the patient, although the contribution of these mutations to WPW syndrome is unknown. These mutations in ion channel genes lead to abnormalities in ion channel function, which result in abnormal ionic current characteristics via defective channel gating or reduction in sarcolemmal channel expression that eventually leads to arrhythmias. \n\nThe incidence of sudden death in patients with WPW is extremely low. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case of sudden death in a man with WPW and myocardial bridge. This case highlights that SCD can occur in WPW patients with mild or unrecognized structural abnormality. In such cases, SCD is likely to be caused by arrhythmias although without the terminal ECG. In forensic autopsy cases suspected of SCD caused by arrhythmia, clinical history is needed in addition to detailed autopsy and histopathology examination. Postmortem genetic testing is also helpful in the diagnosis of the specific etiology to explain SCD. In addition, the deceased with WPW syndrome have accessory atrio-ventricular connections in the heart anatomy, but the cardiac autopsy cannot provide a standardized demonstration of accessory pathways at the histological assessment.  Hence, the diagnosis of WPW at postmortem relies on typical ECG findings form medical records. \n\n\n## Ethical standards \n  \nThe authors declare that all procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

{"text": "Firbank, Michael J. and Parikh, Jehill and Murphy, Nicholas and Killen, Alison and Allan, Charlotte L. and Collerton, Daniel and Blamire, Andrew M. and Taylor, John-Paul\nNeurology, 2018\n\n# Title\n\nReduced occipital GABA in Parkinson disease with visual hallucinations\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Objective \n  \nTo investigate the relationship between visual hallucinations in Parkinson disease (PD) and levels of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the primary visual cortex. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate occipital GABA levels in 36 participants with PD, 19 with and 17 without complex visual hallucinations, together with 20 healthy controls without hallucinations. In addition, we acquired T1-weighted MRI, whole-brain fMRI during a visual task, and diffusion tensor imaging. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe found lower GABA+/creatine in PD with visual hallucinations (0.091 \u00b1 0.010) vs those without (0.101 \u00b1 0.010) and controls (0.099 \u00b1 0.010) (  F   = 4.5;   p   = 0.016). Reduced gray matter in the hallucinations group was also observed in the anterior temporal lobe. Although there were widespread reductions in white matter integrity in the visual hallucinations group, this was no longer significant after controlling for cognitive function. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe data suggest that reduced levels of GABA are associated with visual hallucinations in PD and implicate changes to the ventral visual stream in the genesis of visual hallucinations. Modulation of visual cortical excitability through, for example, pharmacologic intervention, may be a promising treatment avenue to explore. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nVisual hallucinations are common in Parkinson disease (PD),  particularly as the disease advances, and range from relatively simple flashes of light or color to more complex hallucinations that are typically well-formed images.  A number of models  have been proposed to explain the origin of complex recurrent visual hallucinations. Unifying elements across the models include breakdown in communication between cortical regions involved in visual processing, and alteration in the weighting of internal vs external input. \n\nA neuropathologic study of the visual system in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) found reduced GABAergic activity in the primary visual cortex.  This may be an adaption to poor visual input or disrupted connectivity with other visual areas, with reduced GABAergic inhibition maintaining the ability to recognize objects, at a cost of seeing things that are not there. \n\nThe aims of this study were therefore to investigate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)+ levels using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the occipital lobe of patients with PD with and without complex visual hallucinations, along with similarly aged healthy participants. We also used structural, diffusion, and fMRI with a flashing checkerboard paradigm to comprehensively investigate brain changes in people with hallucinations. \n\nWe hypothesized that (1) GABA+ would be reduced in participants with visual hallucinations, and correlated with hallucination symptom severity; (2) GABA+ levels would inversely correlate with fMRI activation; and (3) in the visual system, there would be brain atrophy and disruption of white matter fibers in those with visual hallucinations, and these changes would correlate with GABA+. \n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nWe prospectively recruited 45 participants between 2014 and 2017 with PD aged 60 years and older, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >12 from a population of local community-dwelling participants who had been referred to local neurology and old age psychiatry services. Twenty-one healthy controls were identified from spouses and friends of participants included in this and previous studies. Diagnosis of PD was made according to the UK Brain Bank criteria  with any cognitive impairment either diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment according to the Movement Disorder Society level 1 criteria  or dementia according to the diagnostic criteria for PD dementia.  Clinical diagnoses were confirmed by an independent and experienced clinician. \n\nControl participants in the study showed no evidence of dementia (from their history and CAMCOG [Cambridge Cognition Examination] score >80). For all participants, exclusion criteria included contraindications for MRI, history of alcohol or substance misuse, moderate to severe visual impairment, significant non-PD\u2013related psychiatric or neurologic history, moderate to severe cerebral small vessel disease, imaging evidence of focal brain lesions, or the presence of other unstable or severe medical illness. The sample size was chosen to give 85% power to detect a 12.5% difference in GABA concentration. \n\n\n#### Clinical assessment \n  \nGlobal cognitive function was assessed using the CAMCOG and MMSE. The presence and severity of any extrapyramidal signs were graded using the motor component of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). \n\nAll participants had their near visual acuity measured with the Snellen chart and Landolt broken rings (test distance 40 cm) after correction of any refractive errors. Participants were excluded if they had significant visual impairment that could not be corrected. We used the best performance across all tests for each participant as a measure of acuity in group comparisons. Computerized tests of visuoperceptual function included angle and motion discrimination tasks, which have established metrics in Lewy body disease and have been reported in a number of our reports. \n\nAs in previous work,  for assessment of visual hallucinations, the hallucinations subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPIhall)  was used with specific reference to visual hallucinations occurring in the previous month. Subsequently, we used the derived NPIhall score (frequency \u00d7 severity of hallucinations) in analyses. For reliability purposes, patients and carers were independently asked about the occurrence of visual hallucinations in the month before MRI using screening questions originating from the North-East Visual Hallucinations Interview III ; any discrepancies in the accounts of hallucinations between patient and carer/family member were discussed with both parties and the assessor, with reformulation of NPIhall test scores (with primacy given to the opinion of the caregiver, where the patient seemed to lack insight). \n\nWe also used the noise pareidolia test  as this has been shown to correlate with tendency to hallucinate in Lewy body dementia. For this test, participants were shown a series of 40 black and white images. These all contain cloud-like noise formations, and in 8 images, there is a face inserted somewhere (the location and face differ for each case). After 3 example images, participants were shown the 40 images one at a time, and asked whether they could see any faces. If so, they were asked to indicate the location of the face(s). We scored the test according to the number of illusory faces seen (i.e., faces indicated where there were not faces inserted in the image). Cognitive fluctuations were quantified with the Mayo Fluctuations Composite Score (MAYO)  and the Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation scale. \n\nParticipants were classed as active visual hallucinators (PD-VH) if they had complex visual hallucinations in the month preceding their interview; otherwise, they were classed as nonhallucinators (controls and PD-nonVH). Since our focus was on complex visual hallucinations, those with minor hallucinations (e.g., passage or feeling of presence) but no complex hallucinations in the last month were included in the PD-nonVH group. We made this distinction since passage and feeling of presence probably have a different etiologic basis to complex hallucinations even though minor visual hallucinations typically precede complex visual hallucinations. \n\n\n\n### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents \n  \nThe study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written consent was obtained from all participants (or nominated independent mental capacity advocate where participant lacked capacity). \n\n\n### MRI acquisition \n  \nParticipants were scanned on a 3T whole-body MR scanner (Achieva scanner; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with body coil transmission and an 8-channel head coil receiver. \n\n#### Magnetic resonance spectroscopy \n  \nWe used the MEGA-PRESS technique,  as previously reported  with a sinc gaussian editing pulse applied alternately at 1.9 ppm (EDIT-ON) and 7.5 ppm (EDIT-OFF). Subtraction of the EDIT-OFF from EDIT-ON spectra allows the 3-ppm GABA+ signal to be separated from the overlying creatine peak. MEGA-PRESS spectra were acquired from a voxel sized 45 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 20 mm centered on the midline of the occipital lobe (data available from Newcastle University e-prints [figure 1]:  ). Sequence parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR) = 2,000 milliseconds (ms); echo time (TE) = 68 ms; 320 averages; acquisition bandwidth = 1,000 Hz; VAPOR (variable power radiofrequency pulses with optimized relaxation delays) water suppression.  Macromolecular suppression editing  was not performed, and thus our results are of GABA+ (i.e., GABA plus macromolecules). The magnetic resonance GABA signal is thought to reflect concentrations of metabolic GABA and levels of ambient extracellular GABA that contribute to tonic GABAergic activity. \n\n\n#### Structural and functional magnetic resonance \n  \nWe acquired images including a whole-brain structural 3-dimensional MPRAGE (magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo) scan with sagittal acquisition, slice thickness 1.0 mm; in-plane resolution 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm; TR = 8.3 ms; TE = 4.6 ms; flip angle = 8\u00b0; and SENSE factor = 2. fMRI data were collected with a gradient-echo echo planar imaging sequence (TR = 1.92 seconds; TE = 40 ms; field of view 192 \u00d7 192 mm ; 64 \u00d7 64 matrix size; flip angle 90\u00b0; 27 slices; slice thickness 3 mm; slice gap 1 mm) with 100 volumes (192 seconds) as participants looked at the checkerboard stimulus. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisitions utilized a 2-dimensional spin-echo, echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequence with 59 slices: TR = 6,100 ms; TE = 70 ms; flip angle = 90\u00b0; field of view = 270 \u00d7 270 mm; pixel size = 2.1 \u00d7 2.1 mm; slice thickness = 2.1 mm. Diffusion weighting was applied in 64 uniformly distributed directions (diffusion b = 1,000 s\u00b7mm ) and there were 6 acquisitions with no diffusion weighting (b = 0 s\u00b7mm ). We also collected an identical image with b = 0 s\u00b7mm  but with the phase encoding direction reversed for distortion correction purposes. \n\n\n#### fMRI stimulus presentation \n  \nfMRI was performed with the same checkerboard paradigm as we have previously utilized.  fMRI-compatible goggles with lenses that ranged from \u22124.0 to 4.0 diopters (0.5 increment) were used to correct any refractive errors that participants had. \n\nThe stimulus presentation was controlled by the psychophysics toolbox  ( ) extension for MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). A block design was used with a full field circular checkerboard stimulus consisting of five 19.2-second blocks of a black-and-white checkerboard (inverting at 7.5 Hz) alternating with five 19.2-second baseline blocks of a gray screen. Participants were asked to focus on a central cross-hair. \n\n\n\n### Magnetic resonance analysis \n  \n#### Spectroscopy data analysis \n  \nGABA+ quantification was performed using the Gannet toolbox for MATLAB  and consisted of the following steps: (1) alignment of each pair (EDIT-ON and EDIT-OFF) of spectra ; (2) subtraction of aligned spectra to produce GABA+ spectra, followed by averaging across acquisitions; (3) fitting a gaussian to the 3-ppm GABA+ peak to quantify GABA+ based on the area under the curve. For a typical edited spectrum and Gaussian fit, see data available from Newcastle University e-prints (figure 1):  . \n\nCholine, creatine, and NAA (  N  -acetylaspartate) amplitudes were quantified from nonedited spectra only using the AMARES (Advanced Method for Accurate, Robust, and Efficient Spectral fitting of MRS data with use of prior knowledge) algorithm from jMRUI (java-based magnetic resonance user interface).  GABA+ and NAA were expressed as ratios and normalized to creatine. MRS fit quality was assessed by an experienced physicist as described previously. \n\n\n#### fMRI analysis \n  \nImaging data were processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)12 ( ) similar to our previous work.  For each participant, the T1 anatomical image was segmented and spatially normalized in SPM using the default parameters. The fMRI data for each stimulus condition were slice timing corrected, motion corrected by aligning all functional images together, and then coregistered with the T1 anatomical image. The spatial normalization parameters from the T1 segmentation were used to transform the fMRI data to standard space with a voxel size of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm. The normalized images were then smoothed with a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 mm full width at half maximum gaussian kernel. A high-pass filter of 128 seconds was used, and serial correlations were removed with SPM's AR(1) model. \n\nThe general linear model in SPM was used to conduct a whole-brain analysis of the fMRI data. We created a design matrix by convolving the time course of the checkerboard block with the canonical hemodynamic response function and its first derivative. The 6 parameters from the motion correction were included in the design matrix as covariates of no interest. Individual participant and second-level (random-effects) group analyses were conducted. Contrast images were generated from \u03b2 estimates for the comparison of checkerboard vs baseline. Results are shown with a voxelwise threshold of   p   < 0.001 (uncorrected) followed by clusterwise threshold of   p   < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE)-corrected for multiple comparisons. \n\nWe also used a region of interest (ROI) analysis focusing on the visual areas. Five ROIs in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space were defined averaging across left and right hemispheres: V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5 were taken from the SPM Anatomy toolbox ( ). We also defined 3 ROIs from the overall activation across all participants\u2014all voxels with activation in the occipital lobe, all voxels with associated deactivation (both with voxelwise threshold at   p   < 0.05 FWE-corrected), and a bilateral LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) region (voxelwise   p   < 0.001 uncorrected). \n\n\n\n### Structural MRI analysis \n  \n#### Gray matter \n  \nFor analysis of gray matter atrophy, the T1-weighted structural images were segmented with the SPM12 segment tool, and then processed using the DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) Toolbox to create a group-specific template, to which the individual images were spatially normalized. Images were modulated to preserve the total tissue amount during normalization and smoothed with an 8-mm gaussian filter. We used the SPM Anatomy toolbox  to identify location of significant clusters. For each participant, we also extracted the fraction of gray matter, white matter, and CSF within the individual spectroscopy voxel location. \n\n\n#### Diffusion white matter \n  \nDTI data were processed using FSL ( ) using the topup program to correct susceptibility-induced distortions using the 2 b = 0 s\u00b7mm  images with opposite phase encoding. The eddy package was then used to correct images for eddy current distortion, movement, and motion-induced signal dropout. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were then calculated with the dtifit software, and the TBSS (tract-based spatial statistics) package  used to align the FA images all together, create a white matter skeleton of major tracts, and extract FA and MD values for each participant on the white matter skeleton. The images were visually inspected at each stage. \n\n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nROI data and clinical variables were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 19; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Independent   t   tests or analysis of variance was used to compare groups for continuous variables. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to compare continuous variables. \n\nFor the fMRI voxelwise data, a 3-group analysis of variance was performed using SPM to determine overall activation patterns and investigate group differences. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was done using SPM on the smoothed modulated gray matter images using a 3-group analysis of covariance, with age and intracranial volume (sum of CSF, gray matter, and white matter) as covariates, and also with the addition of CAMCOG as a measure of cognitive function. We investigated, with SPM, the relationship of GABA+/creatine (Cr) with voxelwise gray matter volume, with covariates of age, intracranial volume, and group (PD-nonVH, PD-VH, and controls). \n\nFor the diffusion analysis, voxelwise differences in MD and FA between groups (with age as a covariate) were estimated using the FSL randomise package. We also used this to look at voxelwise correlations with occipital GABA+/Cr, controlling for age and group (PD-nonVH, PD-VH, and control). This was repeated with the addition of CAMCOG as a measure of cognitive function. \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nAnonymized data on which this article is based will be shared on request with any appropriately qualified investigator. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nMRI scans were obtained on 20 of the controls and 36 participants with PD, of whom 15 had mild cognitive impairment and 21 had PD dementia.   shows the demographics for these participants. There were no significant differences in age or sex between hallucination groups, and there were no differences in duration of PD or levodopa dose between the PD-VH and PD-nonVH groups. However, the PD-VH group had worse motor function according to the UPDRS-III score (  p   < 0.001), worse cognition on the CAMCOG scale (  p   < 0.001), and were more likely to be taking cholinesterase inhibitors (  p   = 0.025). As expected, the PD-VH group had significantly higher hallucination scores and were more likely to have misperceptions on the pareidolia test compared to the PD-nonVH group. Data available from Newcastle University e-prints (table 1:  ) compare the patients with PD with vs without dementia. There were no significant differences in age, sex, years of education, duration of PD, or levodopa dose. The participants with dementia had a higher UPDRS-III score, poorer vision, and a greater tendency to hallucinate as indicated by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and pareidolia test. \n  \nDemographics \n  \nWe excluded 4 participants (1 PD-VH, 2 PD-nonVH, 1 control) from the spectroscopy analysis because they did not meet MRS quality-assurance criteria.  There were no significant differences in age, sex, or diagnosis of dementia between the excluded and nonexcluded participants.   shows the ratio of GABA+ and NAA to Cr for the groups. There was a significant group difference in the GABA+/Cr ratio ( ), with post hoc Tukey test finding GABA+/Cr reduced in PD-VH relative to PD-nonVH. The group difference remained significant after including CAMCOG as a measure of cognitive ability in the linear model (  F   = 3.27,   p   = 0.047). There were no significant differences in gray or white matter proportion within the voxel between groups ( ). Within the PD group, GABA+/Cr correlated with visual acuity (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.4,   p   = 0.025), MMSE (\u03c1 = 0.35,   p   = 0.047), UPDRS-III (\u03c1 = \u22120.345,   p   = 0.049), and MAYO total score (\u03c1 = \u22120.627,   p   < 0.001). There were no significant correlations (  p   > 0.1) with disease duration, CAMCOG, angle or motion test, or the pareidolia test. There were no significant correlations between GABA+/Cr and NPI hallucination score after controlling for VH group. \n  \nOccipital spectroscopy results \n     The occipital lobe GABA+/Cr ratio in the 3 groups  \nCr = creatine; GABA = \u03b3-aminobutyric acid; PD = Parkinson disease; VH = visual hallucinator. \n  \nThere was no significant difference in GABA+/Cr levels between participants with PD taking cholinesterase inhibitors vs those not taking them (0.098 SD 0.012 vs 0.093 SD 0.008;   t   = 1.16,   p   = 0.26), between those taking antipsychotic agents (quetiapine) vs those not (0.088 SD 0.007 vs 0.097 SD 0.011;   t   = 1.42,   p   = 0.17), and there was no significant correlation between levodopa dose and GABA+/Cr (\u03c1 = 0.018,   p   = 0.9). \n\nThe fMRI scans were not acquired on one PD participant, who did not tolerate the full scanning session, and 4 PD participants' scans were excluded because of excessive motion, leaving 17 PD-VH, 14 PD-nonVH, and 20 controls with usable fMRI data. All groups showed a typical activation pattern to the checkerboard (data available from Newcastle University e-prints [figure 2]:  ), but there were no significant differences in activation between any groups. In the ROI analysis ( ), there were significant within-group activations in all regions apart from the V5 in the PD-VH group (1-sample test,   T   = 0.64;   p   = 0.53). However, there were no significant differences in activation between groups for any region. In the PD group, there was a significant positive correlation between the GABA+/Cr ratio and activation in the V5 ROI (Pearson degrees of freedom = 29,   r   = 0.373,   p   = 0.046) but not with the V1\u2013V4 ROIs (Pearson   r   < 0.33,   p   > 0.08). \n  \nCheckerboard fMRI BOLD \u03b2 value from predetermined regions of interest \n  \nMRI diffusion data were obtained on 17 PD-VH, 18 PD-nonVH, and 20 controls. The TBSS analysis found widespread differences between controls and PD-VH in both FA and MD (data available from Newcastle University e-prints [figure 3]:  ). However, after including CAMCOG as a covariate in the analysis, this obviated significant group differences. For the voxelwise correlations between GABA+/Cr and both MD and FA controlling for age and group, there was only a very small cluster (24 voxels) in the posterior corpus callosum. This was still significant after inclusion of CAMCOG in the model. \n\nThe VBM analysis on the 17 PD-VH, 19 PD-nonVH, and 20 controls found a significant cluster of reduced gray matter in the right anterior temporal lobe of the PD-VH group compared to both the PD-nonVH and the control group ( ; data available from Newcastle University e-prints [table 2]:  ). This cluster extended to the hippocampus and amygdala in the control vs PD-VH comparison, and there was a nonsignificant cluster in the right hippocampus and amygdala. There was also a cluster of reduced gray matter in the PD-VH compared to the control group in the V4 region (27% V4, 26% fusiform gyrus FG1, 16% V3v). With the addition of CAMCOG as a covariate to the model, there were still significant differences in the anterior temporal lobe for the PD-nonVH vs PD-VH comparison (figure 2; data available from Newcastle University e-prints [table 2]:  ). \n   Voxelwise morphometry results, showing regions of altered gray matter  \nDecreased gray matter for (A) PD-VH < control, (B) PD-VH < PD-nonVH, (C) PD-VH < PD-nonVH controlling for CAMCOG score. Voxelwise threshold =   p   < 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons (radiologic convention: L = R). CAMCOG = Cambridge Cognition Examination; PD-nonVH = Parkinson disease\u2013non-visual hallucinator; PD-VH = Parkinson disease\u2013visual hallucinator. \n  \nTo investigate associations between GABA+ and atrophy, we performed a VBM analysis of gray matter against GABA+/Cr controlling for age and group. There was an occipital cluster (66% in V1 and 22% in V2) where GABA+/Cr positively correlated with gray matter (data available from Newcastle University e-prints [table 2, figure 4]:  ), but this was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (cluster   p   = 0.08, FWE-corrected). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe found reduced levels of GABA+ in the PD-VH group, and there was evidence of gray matter loss in the anterior temporal lobe as well as region V4 of the visual cortex. There were, however, no alterations in functional activity in response to visual excitation by the checkerboard stimulus or in white matter diffusion parameters, once covariates were accounted for. \n\nAs hypothesized, GABA+ concentration was reduced in PD-VH compared to PD-nonVH. This agrees with the neuropathologic study finding reduced GABAergic markers in DLB.  We found that the participants with hallucinations had worse acuity, which correlated with GABA+ levels in the PD group. Combined with previous research that found that occipital GABA levels decrease after eye occlusion,  our findings support the hypothesis that poor input to the visual cortex leads to levels of inhibitory GABA being reduced to optimize visual processing, at the price of increased misclassifications of ambiguous stimuli.  The absence of associations between GABA+ and severity of visual hallucinations suggests that low GABA levels may predispose people to hallucinate, but the occurrence of visual hallucinations is controlled by other factors, including attention and the visual environment. If visual hallucinations are partly facilitated by decreased levels of GABA in the occipital cortex causing hyperexcitability, one therapeutic strategy might be to utilize antiepileptic drugs. In PD, the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT ) antagonist ondansetron and the 5-HT  reverse agonist pimavanserin have been used to treat visual hallucinations.  Since 5-HT receptors can modulate release of GABA,  it may be that the mode of action of these drugs in treating hallucinations is partly through their effect on GABA. \n\nThere was no difference in functional activation between the PD-VH group and any other group. This relative lack of difference in functional activity fits with the suggestion that visual hallucinations are a side effect of neural changes aimed at preserving visual function in the face of worsening visual input or connectivity.  It is also in agreement with the postmortem observations  of little Lewy body disease pathology in the primary visual cortex but alterations of neurone function in the fusiform gyrus.  The PD-VH group, unlike the PD-nonVH group, did not show significant activation in the V5 region. Duann et al.  reported that activation in the V5 region to a flickering checkerboard was more variable within-subject compared to primary visual cortex and speculated that this might be due to differing levels of top-down influence such as paying attention to the motion aspect of the stimulus. We previously reported  reduced activation in V5 in DLB to a motion stimulus, and it could be that dysfunction of this region contributes to visual hallucinations as object motion is improperly tracked, leading to discrepancies between the internal model of the world and reality. \n\nWe found only a weak association in the PD group between GABA+ and blood oxygen level\u2013dependent (BOLD) activation in the V5 ROI. This goes against our hypothesized negative relationship between GABA and occipital BOLD activations, which was based on previous observations that these factors are related.  However, some recent studies in normal participants have also failed to demonstrate a significant association between occipital GABA and BOLD.  Possible explanations for the lack of an association include the fact that the BOLD signal is an indirect measure of neuronal activity and is dependent on blood flow and vascular reactivity, which could be altered in our participants. \n\nWe found widespread alterations in MD and FA in the PD-VH group in comparison to controls controlling for age. However, after including CAMCOG score in the model, there were no significant group differences, and there was only a very small region where GABA+ correlated with FA, and none with MD. Previous reports have found widespread reductions in FA and increases in MD in PD dementia,  suggesting that the DTI group differences were driven by overall disease severity, rather than being specifically related to the presence of visual hallucinations. Few studies have investigated the relationship between DTI measures and visual hallucinations in PD; Lee et al.  found increased MD in the parietotemporal region of PD-VH, with more widespread changes in those with dementia. Although we found that differences in MD and FA were not specifically related to visual hallucinations, nevertheless, it is possible that the presence of the white matter alterations may have contributed to the formation of hallucinations in the group, as suggested by the disconnection models of visual hallucinations. \n\nThe ventral visual stream is likely to be involved in visual hallucination genesis, since it is chiefly responsible for object representation and recognition.  The ventral stream includes projections from the primary visual cortex to the temporal lobe. Previous MRI studies of gray matter atrophy in PD-VH have found a number of regions involved, including the temporal lobe and lateral occipital lobe.  Ventral stream temporal areas contain relatively high numbers of Lewy bodies,  with a gradient of increasing density toward the anterior temporal lobe,  and it has been speculated that these pathologic changes may contribute to visual hallucinations in DLB. The midline occipital lobe is relatively spared in DLB,  and as shown by our fMRI data, is functionally intact, suggesting that the observed GABA reduction may be driven by ventral stream pathology leading to altered connectivity between the primary visual cortex and higher visual areas. \n\nOur most significant structural finding was gray matter loss in the temporal pole and amygdala, along with reductions in PD-VH relative to controls in area V4 of the occipital lobe. The V4 area projects to the parahippocampal gyrus  and is involved in object recognition and coordinating signals between the early and higher visual areas. The combination of atrophy in ventral stream structures, and white matter changes including to the temporal and frontal lobes, is consistent with the hypothesis  of disrupted communication between the ventral visual stream and lateral frontal cortex as being mechanistically involved in the generation of visual hallucinations. \n\nAlthough we used a well-established MRS technique for investigating GABA, there are some limitations to the study. The magnetic resonance spectrum of GABA is complex and coincides with that of other molecules. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRS, we did not use macromolecule suppression techniques,  and our measured signal thus represents a combination of GABA and macromolecules. Other limitations of the study include that, because of time constraints, we acquired a spectrum from only one location, and thus we are not able to say whether the GABA+ changes in PD-VH are specific to the occipital lobe. Since visual hallucinations are more common in more severe disease and in those with cognitive impairment, it may be that GABA+ levels related to disease severity, rather than specifically hallucinations. However, our finding of increased GABA+ remained significant after including a measure of global cognition in the model, suggesting that the changes were not purely driven by disease stage. \n\nFinally, an inherent difficulty in investigating visual hallucinations is that the investigator must rely on subjective reports from the participant, thus risking misclassification, particularly in individuals with cognitive impairment, and making it more challenging to find correlates of hallucination severity. We cross-checked hallucination reports between participants and their informants to increase reliability, and used the previously validated pareidolia test,  finding significantly increased rates of visual misperception in the PD-VH group, providing confidence in our visual hallucinations group classification. \n\nWe found alterations to GABA+ in the occipital cortex, together with structural changes in the ventral stream of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations. Further longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the connection between these changes and how they influence the development of visual hallucinations. This may have important translational implications, as remediation of GABAergic function or reduction in visual cortical hyperexcitability may represent a novel treatment approach for visual hallucinations in PD. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6105043, "text_md5": "e8b7d5322c483b467c35649be90136e1", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 169], "journal": [170, 179], "publication_year": [181, 185], "title": [196, 266], "keywords": [280, 280], "abstract": [293, 1635], "body": [1644, 32564]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30021920, "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000006007", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105043", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6105043"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105043\">6105043</a>", "list_title": "PMC6105043  Reduced occipital GABA in Parkinson disease with visual hallucinations"}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a volume of interest (VOI) analysis on the principles of echo shifting with a train of observations (PRESTO) imaging using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 and the WFU PickAtlas program for the diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndrome. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nFifty subjects, including 13 with the Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 12 with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and 13 controls were evaluated in this study. After the spatial normalization of PRESTO images on SPM8, the WFU PickAtlas program was performed to create target VOIs in the putamen, red nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) was calculated by normalizing the signal of each VOI to that of the cerebrospinal fluid space. These SIRs were used as determinants in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nSIR of the putamen was significantly lower in MSA-P than in PSP (  P   = 0.0051) and controls (  P   = 0.0004).

In ROC analyses, SIR of the putamen exhibited the highest areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.83 (vs. PSP) and 0.91 (vs. controls) in the diagnosis of MSA-P. On the other hand, SIR of the red nucleus exhibited the highest AUCs of 0.87 (vs. MSA-P), 0.90 (vs. PD), and 0.89 (vs. controls) in the diagnosis of PSP. \n\n\n## Conclusions: \n  \nThe VOI analysis based on spatially normalized PRESTO images may be useful for depicting hypointensity, indicative of abnormal iron depositions, of the putamen and red nucleus in the diagnosis of MSA-P and PSP. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOne of the common clinical issues encountered in the management of Parkinsonian disorders is the differentiation of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) from atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) including the Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Correct diagnoses at early disease stages are important for adequate management. Brain MR imaging is recommended in the diagnostic work-up of Parkinsonism because it supports the diagnosis of APS or vascular Parkinsonism.  It is also useful for diagnosing the other causes of Parkinsonism such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and brain tumors. \n\nRecent studies have suggested that the sensitivity of long echo time high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo sequences, including the principles of echo shifting with a train of observations (PRESTO) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), to brain iron depositions is greater than that of conventional T *-weighted images (T *WIs).  These sequences also create better anatomic images on which basal ganglia structures are easily visible. Based on the different patterns of abnormal brain iron depositions between PD and APS, evaluating these disorders on PRESTO and SWI is considered appropriate. Previous studies utilizing PRESTO and SWI for the differentiation of Parkinsonism reported that these sequences provided new diagnostic markers for clinical use.  These studies mainly conducted visual or manual region of interest (ROI) assessments. However, these methods are subjective and inadequate for the evaluation of anatomical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus, which are difficult to identify on visual evaluation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of an advanced objective analysis on PRESTO imaging for the differentiation of APS from PD. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Patients and control subjects \n  \nThis was a retrospective study that evaluated the diagnostic value of an objective analysis on PRESTO from the data source at our medical center. This study utilized data obtained at a single medical center, and was approved by our Institutional Review Board. The privacy of the patients was completely protected. \n\nIn this study, the patient group was selected following a search of the medical records filed in our institution between August 2007 and December 2014. Patient backgrounds were standardized by applying the following inclusion criteria: (1) clinical diagnoses at the Department of Neurology according to the published criteria of PD, MSA-P, and PSP  and (2) the acquisition of PRESTO images. An exclusion criterion was the insufficient quality of PRESTO images due to significantly abnormal findings (e.g., large cerebral infarctions and hemorrhages) adjacent to the volume of interest (VOI) described below and apparent artifacts that disturbed the spatial normalization process. Twelve PD (mean age, 65 \u00b1 8 years; 3 men and 9 women), 13 MSA-P (mean age, 64 \u00b1 8 years; 5 men and 8 women), and 12 PSP (mean age, 70 \u00b1 5 years; 6 men and 6 women) patients were enrolled in this study. All PSP and MSA-P patients with full clinical data and follow-up information were included, whereas a subset of patients was selected randomly for PD in the alphabetical order of their names. Since patient samples with an unequal size are known to influence diagnostic values such as accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,  the numbers of MSA-P, PSP, and PD patients were adjusted to be almost equal in the present study. Thirteen age-matched individuals (mean age, 63 \u00b1 13 years; 5 men and 8 women) without obvious neurological and MR abnormalities were identified during the same period and enrolled as control subjects. \n\n\n### MRI protocol \n  \nAll 50 subjects underwent MRI examinations on a 1.5T imager (Gyroscan Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a sensitivity-encoding parallel imaging head coil. Three-dimensional (3D) sections from PRESTO images were obtained in a transverse plane, for which the scanning parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR), 24\u201336 ms; echo time (TE), 34\u201346 ms; flip angle (FA), 20\u00b0; field of view (FOV), 230 mm; matrix, 320 \u00d7 320; and 2-mm-thick gapless sections. Additionally, 3D T -turbo field echo (3DT TFE) images were obtained in a sagittal plane, for which the scanning parameters were as follows: TR, 8.1\u20138.3 ms; TE, 3.7\u20133.8 ms; FA, 7\u00b0; FOV, 256 mm; matrix, 256 \u00d7 256; and 1-mm-thick gapless sections. All images were visually inspected for apparent artifacts such as patient motions. \n\n\n\n## PRESTO Image Analysis \n  \n### PRESTO template creation and spatial normalization \n  \nTo perform the automated analyses, it was necessary to create the template for the spatial normalization of PRESTO images. For this procedure, nine normal subjects (unpublished data set; mean age, 65 \u00b1 10 years; 3 men and 6 women) who underwent both PRESTO and 3DT TFE images were recruited. PRESTO and 3DT TFE images of the nine normal subjects were initially converted from DICOM files to analyze formats using MRIcro ( ) and transferred to statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 (Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College, London, UK), which was run on MATLAB version R2010a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For each subject, 3DT TFE images were coregistered with PRESTO images. Then, a linear and nonlinear transformation of the 3DT TFE images was performed. Pixel threshold was set to 10% of the whole-brain mean to eliminate background noises and partial volume effects at the edge of the brain. Data were standardized with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas using a 12-parameter affine transformation, followed by 16 nonlinear transformations and a trilinear interpolation. Spatially normalized images were not modulated (i.e., preserve concentrations). The final image format was 16-bit, with a size of 91 \u00d7 109 \u00d7 91 and a voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm. This voxel size was sufficiently small to evaluate the deep nuclei.  These transformation parameters of 3DT TFE images were applied to normalize the corresponding subjects\u2019 PRESTO images. A template of the PRESTO image was obtained by calculating a mean image from normalized PRESTO images of these nine normal subjects. \n\nFinally, PRESTO images of 12 PD, 13 MSA-P, 12 PSP patients and 13 control subjects were spatially normalized onto this in-house-made PRESTO template in the MNI space. \n\n\n### VOI analysis \n  \nVOIs were obtained with WFU PickAtlas (Talairach brain atlas theory), which automatically generated segmented atlas VOI templates in the MNI space.  The VOIs defined in the atlas were originally based on manual delineation of the brain region borders according to the Talairach atlas. According to the previous studies that evaluated iron depositions in PD and APS,  five bilateral hemispheric VOI labels provided as default settings by the software were evaluated: \u201cputamen,\u201d \u201csubstantia nigra,\u201d \u201cred nucleus,\u201d \u201csubthalamic nucleus,\u201d and \u201cdentate nucleus\u201d ( ). The caudate nucleus and thalamus were not evaluated because these structures are known to be easily affected by atrophy and ventricular dilatation. The deposition of iron in these nuclei may be uneven and focal; therefore, the minimal signal intensity instead of the average of target VOIs was evaluated in order to avoid underestimation.  Since PRESTO images were relative data, signal intensity normalization was performed by normalizing each VOI to that of the cerebrospinal fluid space.  After spatial normalization and VOI placement, the presence of misregistration was visually evaluated. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 21 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed data (gender, Hoehn-Yahr stage, disease duration, and signal intensity ratio (SIR) of the putamen, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus), and a one-way analysis of variance for normally distributed data (age and SIR of the red nucleus) were performed for comparisons among patients and control groups. When a significant level was found in multiple comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U test or unpaired   t  -test was also performed. The relationships between SIR and clinical parameters including disease duration and severity were assessed by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient or Pearson\u2019s product-moment. After Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons, differences were considered significant when   P   < 0.0083. Using the SIR in target VOIs as a threshold, a ROC curve analysis was performed to determine which VOI discriminated the different groups. The Youden\u2019s index was applied to determine the cut-off values. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nPatient characteristics are summarized in  . No significant difference was observed in age or sex among the patient and control groups. Furthermore, no significant differences were noted in the disease duration or severity (i.e., Hoehn-Yahr stage) between the patient groups. \n\nTypical original and normalized PRESTO images of the putamen, substantia nigra, red nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus are presented in  . On visual inspection, there was no apparent misregistration of VOIs on spatially normalized PRESTO images in any patients or controls. The results of VOI analyses are shown in  . SIR of the putamen was significantly lower in MSA-P patients (0.25 \u00b1 0.15) than in PSP patients (0.52 \u00b1 0.25;   P   = 0.0051) and controls (0.57 \u00b1 0.18;   P   = 0.0004). In spite of the low putaminal SIR in MSA-P patients, no significant difference was observed between MSA-P and PD patients (0.25 \u00b1 0.15 vs. 0.36 \u00b1 0.18;   P   = 0.13). On the other hand, SIR of the red nucleus was significantly lower in PSP patients (0.55 \u00b1 0.22) than in MSA-P patients (0.81 \u00b1 0.15;   P   = 0.0003), PD patients (0.89 \u00b1 0.12;   P   = 0.0029), and controls (0.84 \u00b1 0.13;   P   = 0.0011). SIR in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus were lower in PSP patients, but not significantly so. There were also no significant group differences in SIR of the dentate nucleus. A relationship was not found between clinical parameters and SIR of the putamen in MSA-P (duration; r = \u20130.27,   P   = 0.36 and severity; r = 0.05,   P   = 0.91) or that of the red nucleus in PSP (duration; r = \u20130.03,   P   = 0.93 and severity; r = \u20130.12,   P   = 0.70). \n\nROC analyses using SIR of the putamen and red nucleus to discriminate among MSA-P, PSP, and other groups were performed in order to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these target VOIs ( ). SIR of the putamen exhibited areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 and 0.91 for differentiating between MSA-P and PSP and between MSA-P and controls, respectively. SIR of the red nucleus exhibited AUC of 0.87, 0.90, and 0.89 for differentiating between PSP and MSA-P, PD, and controls, respectively. Cut-off values of SIR in these VOIs, and their sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies are shown in  . \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe results of the present study, which showed iron deposition in the putamen and red nucleus in MSA-P and PSP patients on PRESTO images, are concordant with previous findings.  In these studies, PRESTO and SWI were mainly evaluated on visual inspection or manual ROI drawing. However, these subjective methodologies encompass various drawbacks including the inconsistency of inter-rater reliability.  It is not considered suitable to evaluate particular anatomical structures such as the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus, which are difficult to recognize on visual inspection, using these methods. Although only a few studies have performed SPM to evaluate PRESTO and SWI,  the voxel-based analysis (VBA) has some limitations. First, VBA is prone to errors caused by misregistration of anatomical structures. Due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility changes, particular structures including the base of the frontal lobes close to the skull base may be affected by the distortion, which can cause the misregistration, on PRESTO imaging. Second, compared with the VOI analysis, there are no standard conventions for what   P   value and multiple comparison correction to apply to statistical analyses in VBA. This can cause both Type 1 and 2 errors as a result of multiple comparisons, and potentially change the final conclusion of the study. On the other hand, the VOI analysis can select target structures which are not affected by distortions. Additionally, the VOI analysis requires less stringent statistical correction than VBA. Finally, the minimal signal intensity instead of the average of target VOIs was evaluated to overcome the disadvantage of the automated VOI analysis which caused false negative results by the inadequate VOI size.  As a result, the combination of SPM and VOI analyses enables the objective evaluation of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus, as performed in the present study. The limitation of deformation accuracy needs to be considered carefully for the interpretation of brain mapping analysis in atrophied brains. It is reported that MRI-aided spatial normalization is more accurate than the one performed by using only functional images, given the better anatomical information and higher spatial resolution of MR images.  Therefore, MRI-aided normalization based on the coregistration of the 3DT TFE and PRESTO images was performed to improve the accuracy of spatial normalization. \n\nPD and APS have been associated with the increased deposition of iron in pathoanatomically relevant structures. Increased concentrations of iron have primarily been reported in the putamen in postmortem studies of MSA-P patients.  Furthermore, the red nucleus is an invariable structure of pathology in PSP, but is not involved in PD or MSA.  The hypointensities of the putamen in MSA-P and the red nucleus in PSP on PRESTO imaging are consistent with previously reported neuropathological changes. However, the signal intensity of the substantia nigra is a debatable issue. In contrast to pathological studies indicating increased iron concentrations in the substantia nigra of PD,  the present results as well as previous findings did not reveal apparent hypointensity in PD patients relative to APS patients or control subjects.  Although there is no doubt about the increase of iron in the substantia nigra of PD, there are large discrepancies in the quantitative levels, ranging from 25% to 100% of the amounts normally observed.  Of note, only ferritin iron is known to cause reduction of T  relaxation and signal in a field-dependent manner, and pathological studies on iron levels of the substantia nigra indicate decreased ferritin levels and increased free iron levels in PD.  These diversities of iron in the substantia nigra of PD can result in the conflicting results of signal intensity on MRI. Additionally, various factors including not only the deposition of iron, but also scan parameters may influence signal intensities on PRESTO and SWI. Previous studies used different 1.5T or 3T magnetic field strength imagers, which may partly explain the discrepancies observed in the evaluation of the substantia nigra in PD patients.  In contrast to PRESTO imaging, SWI acquires magnitude and phase information, which enables the evaluation of phase shifting. We assumed that these different factors affected the signal intensity of the substantia nigra in PD. By considering the pathological changes indicating that the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra are commonly affected structures in PSP patients,  PSP groups were expected to have relatively lower intensities in these structures. Iron deposition in the putamen in PD, even though less than in MSA-P, may also affect signal intensities.  The absence of a relationship between disease severity and iron deposition is consistent with the hypothesis that iron deposition may represent a secondary response rather than a primary event promoting the cascade of neurodegeneration. \n\nThe relatively small number of patients is a limitation of the present study, and may have affected the diagnostic value of VOI analyses on PRESTO imaging. Based on the effects of the magnetic field strength on sensitivity to susceptibility changes,  it is desirable to perform PRESTO imaging on higher magnetic field images than 1.5T images. Considering the relative value of signal intensity on PRESTO imaging, the SIR method was applied in the present study. However, combination of VBA and other more quantitative methods including phase information and relaxometry may give further perceptions for the evaluation of iron depositions in the diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndrome. Furthermore, our study may also have been limited by the absence of pathological diagnoses in all cases. Therefore, we considered it necessary to investigate more cases of APS and PD in order to further clarify the diagnostic value of VOI analyses on PRESTO imaging. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nOur VOI analyses combining PRESTO imaging, SPM8, and the WFU PickAtlas demonstrated the diagnostic value of hypointensity, indicative of abnormal iron deposition, in the putamen and red nucleus for diagnosing MSA-P and PSP. Thus, an automatic objective evaluation of PRESTO imaging may represent a diagnostic marker for MSA-P and PSP. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5600039, "text_md5": "9a74af36dd4859bec93ccdda274c4490", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 258], "journal": [259, 277], "publication_year": [279, 283], "title": [294, 438], "keywords": [452, 659], "abstract": [672, 2733], "body": [2742, 20160]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 27001391, "doi": "10.2463/mrms.mp.2015-0132", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600039", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5600039"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600039\">5600039</a>", "list_title": "PMC5600039  Volume of Interest Analysis of Spatially Normalized PRESTO Imaging to Differentiate between Parkinson Disease and Atypical Parkinsonian Syndrome"}

Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) detected in magnetic resonance imaging may be a complication of the ablation procedure, but it is well documented only in atrial fibrillation ablation. Ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (L-AP) has a similar target area, but WPW patients differ from those with atrial fibrillation, due to lower initial risk of cerebral embolic events. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ablation of left-sided accessory pathways carries the risk of SCI. \n\n\n## Material/Methods \n  \nTwenty consecutive patients with overt L-AP referred for RF ablation in our center were included in the study. An irrigated ablation catheter was used in 8 patients, and a non-irrigated ablation catheter was used in 12 patients. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed pre-procedurally and on the next day after the ablation in all patients. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nAblation procedures were completed without complications and there were no neurological symptoms following the procedure, although in 2 patients (10%), post-procedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance revealed new acute silent cerebral infarcts. Both patients with new cerebral lesions were female, and a non-irrigated catheter was used in both cases. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis is the first study documenting the presence of silent cerebral infarcts after WPW ablation. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the risk of silent cerebral infarcts associated with L-AP ablation. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nCerebral ischemia and stroke are possible complications of the ablation procedure, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). In the vast majority of patients, periprocedural cerebral embolism is completely asymptomatic and can be detected with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), a useful tool to detect acute cerebral ischemic lesions [ ]. This phenomenon is usually referred to as silent cerebral infarct (SCI), and is well documented in AF ablation, with an incidence of 1.7\u201343%, depending upon procedural parameters and technology used [ \u2013 ]. Recently, it was also reported after left-sided ventricular arrhythmias ablation [ ]. The clinical significance of SCI is being discussed, and there are data linking this phenomenon with cognitive disorders and dementia [ , ]. The relatively high incidence of SCI during AF ablation can be explained by the high risk of cerebral embolic events in the AF population itself. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke 5-fold, and the risk of death 2-fold [ \u2013 ]. Additionally, the specific target area for curative ablation in AF, localized in the left atrium, makes it more likely that any procedure-related thromboembolic material will easily travel with the blood flow to the central nervous system, resulting in (symptomatic or not) ischemic lesions. \n\nIn the population of patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), the accessory pathway is more frequently localized it the left heart (between the left atrium and the left ventricle) [ ]. In this subgroup of WPW patients, during the ablation procedure we target the same area as during the AF ablation, but the patients are different from those with AF, with low initial risk of cerebral embolic events. The described incidence of symptomatic cerebral stroke complicating the ablation in WPW syndrome is low [ ]. Interestingly, the presence of microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler during left-sided accessory pathway ablation was recently described [ ], but there are no published data on the incidence of MRI-confirmed silent cerebral infarcts related to this procedure. \n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the ablation of left-sided accessory pathways carries the same risk of silent cerebral infarcts as in AF ablation. \n\n\n## Material and Methods \n  \n### Patients characteristics \n  \nTwenty consecutive WPW patients (white, 13 males, mean age 44.9\u00b114.7 years) with overt left-sided accessory pathway, without structural heart disease, referred for radiofrequency (RF) ablation in our center were included in the study. Patients with current contraindications for MRI were excluded. The characteristics of the patients are presented in  . No patients had a history of cerebrovascular incident or transient ischemic attack or evidence of aortic atherosclerotic disease. We decided to calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score (although none of the patients had the history of atrial fibrillation), as it involves the same known risk factors for stroke as in the non-AF population. Eight patients (40%) had a history of arterial hypertension. Two patients received aspirin, which was continued during the procedure. \n\n\n### Study protocol \n  \nIn all patients, neurological assessment and DW-MRI were performed on the day before the ablation procedure. The same examination, including DW-MRI, was repeated on the day after the ablation procedure in all patients. The study protocol was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Lublin (approval number KE-0254/292/2012) and written informed consent was signed by all participants. \n\n\n### Accessory pathway ablation \n  \nRadiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of left-sided accessory pathway was successfully performed in all 20 patients with no acute complications, with a mean procedure time of 92.7\u00b123.6 minutes. To reach the ablation site, in 13 patients we used the retrograde approach via the femoral artery, and in 7 patients we used the transseptal approach. Irrigated-tip ablation catheters (Thermocool, Biosense Webster or AlCath Flux, Biotronic) were used in 12 patients ( ), and in 8 patients we used solid-tip ablation catheters (Marinr, Medtronic, or AlCath, Biotronik). The operator decided which ablation catheter type to use. In all patients, a diagnostic decapolar catheter was placed in the coronary sinus. Heparin (total dose of 75 I.U. per kg body weight) was administered during the procedure: half of the dose at the beginning of the procedure and the other half immediately after catheters were introduced to the left heart (both with retrograde or transseptal approach). In case of transseptal approach, the transseptal sheath was constantly flushed with heparinized saline. Radiofrequency energy (Atakr II RF generator, Medtronic) was delivered in power-control mode (power limit 30 W, maximum temperature 46\u00baC) with an irrigated-tip catheter, and with temperature-control mode (power limit 50 W, maximum temperature 60\u00b0C) it was delivered with a solid-tip catheter. All patients received enoxaparin (1 mg/kg) at 6 and 24 h after the procedure, followed by acetylsalicylic acid for 6 weeks. \n\n\n### Diffusion-weighted MRI \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla Siemens Avanto) was performed the day before and within 48 h after the ablation procedure in all patients. The protocol included a diffusion-weighted single-shot spin echo sequence (diffusion gradient b values of 0 and 1.000 s/mm  repetition time 4000 ms, echo time 89 ms, slice thickness 5 mm), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR; TR/TE 9.000/120 msec), and T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE; TR/TE 4.000/99 ms) sequences. Acute ischemic lesions were defined as focal diffusion anomalies \u2013 \u201cbright signals\u201d. Additionally, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured to assist image analysis in equivocal cases. All MRIs were analyzed by a certified radiologist. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nIntroduction of the catheters, accessory pathway mapping, and ablation were completed in all patients, without acute complications. There was no evidence of charring/clot formation on the ablation catheter, and no air embolism was detected during all ablation procedures. The mean procedure time was 92.7 min and mean fluoroscopy time was 11.4 min. There were no neurological symptoms following the procedure, although in 2 patients (10%), post-procedural diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW+FLAIR) revealed new acute silent cerebral infarcts, as described below. \n\nThe first patient was a 49-year-old woman with the history of hypertension. She had no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and her CHA DS -VASc score was 2. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Retrograde approach to the ablation site was used and the ablation was performed with an 8-mm solid-tip catheter. The procedure time was 110 min. The post-procedural diffusion-weighted MRI revealed 2 new cerebral infarcts, located in the right parietal lobe and in the left cerebellar hemisphere ( ). \n\nThe second patient was a 19-year-old woman without coexisting comorbidities, and her CHA DS -VASc score was 1. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Transseptal approach to the ablation site was used and the ablation was performed with an 8-mm solid-tip catheter. The procedure time was 120 min. The post-procedural diffusion-weighted MRI revealed a new embolic lesion in the left frontal lobe ( ). Clinical examinations performed on the same and the following day revealed no clinical signs of cerebral ischemia in either patient. \n\nThe study population was not large enough to identify the risk factors, but both patients with new cerebral lesions were females and, in both cases, a non-irrigated catheter was used. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Main findings \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting the presence of acute silent cerebral infarcts detected by DW-MRI during the different approaches to the left-sided accessory pathway catheter ablation. The results show that SCI: (1) can occur with the use of both transseptal or retrograde approach and (2) were recorded only when ablation was performed with non-irrigated catheters. \n\n\n### DW-MRI for silent cerebral ischemia detection \n  \nDW-MRI is a useful diagnostic tool to detect silent cerebral lesions. Acute ischemia of brain tissue leads to severe restriction in diffusion of water, almost certainly due to cytotoxic edema, which is identified as \u201cbright signals\u201d on DW-MRI soon after ischemia onset [ ]. With this tool, SCI was described after such potentially thrombogenic cardiovascular interventions as coronary angioplasty [ ], cardiac surgery [ ], carotid endarterectomy [ ] transcatheter aortic valve implantation [ ], and atrial fibrillation ablation [ \u2013 ]. In a recently published paper, Whitman et al. for the first time reported the presence of SCI detected with DW-MRI after ablation of arrhythmia other than atrial fibrillation. Interestingly, they documented the presence of asymptomatic cerebral infarcts after ablation of ventricular arrhythmias originating in the left but not in the right ventricle [ ]. To date, there are no such data concerning accessory pathway ablation. \n\n\n### Possible risk factors of SCI \n  \nThere are several identified risk factors of SCI following AF ablation: age [ ], spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in TEE examination [ , ], and cardioversion during the ablation procedure [ ]. In our study, both patients with new post-procedural silent cerebral infarcts were females and in both a non-irrigated solid-tip catheter was used. Although women in general have slightly higher risk of thromboembolic events (reflected in the CHA DS -VASc score calculation), published reports [ , , , ] show no correlation between sex and the incidence of silent cerebral infarcts following ablation procedures. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no data on SCI incidence following ablation procedure with non-irrigated solid-tip standard catheter, since it is no longer used in the atrial fibrillation ablation. There are published reports regarding SCI after AF ablation with different types of non-irrigated catheters dedicated to the pulmonary vein isolation: cryoballoon, laser balloon, and multipolar phased radiofrequency catheters [ \u2013 , ]; however, these technologies are entirely different from classical catheters. The standard, solid-tip catheters are commonly used during accessory pathway ablation in WPW patients, and our study is the first to demonstrate the incidence of SCI following such procedures. \n\n\n### The clinical significance of SCI \n  \nAlthough SCI phenomenon related to various cardiovascular interventions was documented, we still do not know if it is really clinically significant. First, ischemic lesions detected by MRI are by definition symptomless, and in most of the cases the ischemic lesions are no longer detectable by DW-MRI performed several months after the index procedure [ ]. Both of the above \u201cknown knowns\u201d could lead us to conclude that SCI is an irrelevant finding. On the other hand, there is evidence that silent cerebral embolism is associated with dementia and gradual cognitive decline [ , ]. Moreover, silent cerebral infarcts can be considered as the marker of thrombogenicity of cardiovascular interventions. Fortunately, symptomatic stroke does not happen frequently enough during most cardiovascular invasive procedures to help us to determine its risk factors, except in very large cohorts. Thus, in studies involving smaller number of patients, SCE can serve as a stroke substitute, permitting the analysis of potential patient- and procedure-dependent risk factors. It is generally agreed that a lower incidence of silent cerebral lesions is associated with lower risk related to the procedure. When we compare our finding of 10% incidence of SCE during the left-sided accessory pathway ablation to the early report by Lickfett et al. [ ], who also documented a 10% incidence of SCE related to AF ablation, as well as with the subsequently published data [ \u2013 ], the left-sided accessory pathway ablation probably has similar thrombogenicity to that of AF ablation. The far lower incidence of reported symptomatic strokes related to WPW ablation probably results from the fact that the patients with WPW syndrome are different from those with AF, with significantly lower initial risk of stroke [ , ]. This risk may be increased, however, in the group of WPW patients with coexisting paroxysmal AF, independent of the increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. \n\nWe demonstrated the presence of new silent cerebral infarcts after left-sided accessory pathway ablation. The study population was too small to provide adequate statistical power, but it is noteworthy that new ischemic lesions were recorded only after ablation procedures performed with non-irrigated catheters. \n\n\n### Study limitations \n  \nFirst, this was a preliminary study; therefore, the study population was not large enough to identify risk factors. Second, the activated clotting time was not monitored because of the short procedure time and the small number of radiofrequency applications. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis is the first study demonstrating the incidence of new silent cerebral infarcts detected by DW-MRI after left-sided accessory pathways ablation. The long-term consequences of these findings are still unknown, and further investigations are needed to evaluate the risk of silent cerebral infarcts associated with accessory pathway ablation. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6391861, "text_md5": "8f844e963d8461d8afdaa3676c5245a2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 139], "journal": [140, 153], "publication_year": [155, 159], "title": [170, 304], "keywords": [318, 374], "abstract": [387, 1971], "body": [1980, 15552]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 30778023, "doi": "10.12659/MSM.914652", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6391861", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6391861"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6391861\">6391861</a>", "list_title": "PMC6391861  Silent Cerebral Infarcts Following Left-Sided Accessory Pathway Ablation in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome: A Preliminary Report"}
{"text": "Nagae, Lidia M. and Honce, Justin M. and Tanabe, Jody and Shelton, Erika and Sillau, Stefan H. and Berman, Brian D.\nFront Neuroanat, 2016\n\n# Title\n\nMicrostructural Changes within the Basal Ganglia Differ between Parkinson Disease Subtypes\n\n# Keywords\n\nParkinson disease\nmotor subtypes\ndiffusion tensor imaging\nbasal ganglia\n\n\n# Abstract\n \nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the substantia nigra has shown promise in detecting and quantifying neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease (PD). It remains unknown, however, whether differences in microstructural changes within the basal ganglia underlie PD motor subtypes. We investigated microstructural changes within the basal ganglia of mild to moderately affected PD patients using DTI and sought to determine if microstructural changes differ between the tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial, and axial diffusivity were obtained from bilateral caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra of 21 PD patients (12 TD and 9 PIGD) and 20 age-matched healthy controls.   T  -tests and ANOVA methods were used to compare PD patients, subtypes, and controls, and Spearman correlations tested for relationships between DTI and clinical measures. We found our cohort of PD patients had reduced fractional anisotropy within the substantia nigra and increased mean and radial diffusivity within the substantia nigra and globus pallidus compared to controls, and that changes within those structures were largely driven by the PIGD subtype. Across all PD patients fractional anisotropy within the substantia nigra correlated with disease stage, while in PIGD patients increased diffusivity within the globus pallidus correlated with disease stage and motor severity. We conclude that PIGD patients have more severely affected microstructural changes within the substantia nigra compared to TD, and that microstructural changes within the globus pallidus may be particularly relevant for the manifestation of the PIGD subtype. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nHeterogeneous clinical phenotypes such as tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) have long been recognized in Parkinson disease (PD) (Jankovic et al.,  ). These PD motor subtypes differ in their clinical course, with the PIGD subtype generally having a more severe course and greater association with non-motor symptoms (Burn et al.,  ; Rajput et al.,  ; van Rooden et al.,  ; de Lau et al.,  ). Improvement in motor function following deep brain stimulation (DBS) may also differ between these subtypes (Katz et al.,  ). Refinement in the clinical classification of PD subtypes is an important goal in PD research to better understand risk factors, mechanism of disease, underlying genetics, and clinical course, as well as to inform better treatment strategies. \n\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI), classically used to probe water motion at the cellular level to investigate white matter integrity, can be used to investigate gray matter microstructure   in vivo   (Schwarz et al.,  ). The gray matter structure of greatest interest in PD has been the substantia nigra (SN) (Chan et al.,  ; Vaillancourt et al.,  ; Zhan et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). In general, decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) along with increased diffusivity measures including mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of the SN has demonstrated promise in being able to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. These prior reports, however, have also shown variable and at times conflicting results (Chan et al.,  ; Vaillancourt et al.,  ; Schwarz et al.,  ). \n\nIn PD, few DTI studies to date have investigated microstructural changes affecting basal ganglia beyond the SN. In a study by Kim et al. increased MD in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus in the absence of significant FA changes was found in a cohort of PD patients (Kim et al.,  ). In a study by Prodoehl et al. FA and diffusivity measures in the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, as well as SN were found to have the ability to discriminate PD from controls as well as PD from atypical parkinsonism and essential tremor (Prodoehl et al.,  ). These studies suggest that the microstructure in a variety of subcortical brain regions may be differentially affected in PD and atypical parkinsonian disorders. \n\nIn the present study, we utilized DTI to investigate microstructural changes within the basal ganglia, including the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus and SN, in PD patients and healthy controls. Our objectives were to: (1) investigate changes in DTI measures (FA, MD, AD, and RD) that occur in PD within the basal ganglia beyond just the substantia nigra, and (2) determine if the DTI measures obtained from these structures differ between the TD and PIGD motor subtypes of PD when compared to controls. We further tested whether DTI measures within the basal ganglia correlated with clinical disease characteristics including duration, stage and severity. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nTwenty-one patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to the UK Parkinson Society Brain Bank criteria (Hughes et al.,  ; 12 male; 61.1 \u00b1 7.7 years) and 20 age-matched healthy controls (11 male; 61.1 \u00b1 9.0 years) were recruited. Patients were Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage I-III and known to be responsive to dopaminergic medication. TD and PIGD scores were calculated using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III motor scores for patients off medication according to previously reported methods (Stebbins et al.,  ). TD/PIGD ratios were generated at the time of screening and subtypes assigned using a cutoff score of \u22651.15 for TD and \u22640.90 for PIGD; scores >0.9 and <1.15 were classified as indeterminate. Indeterminate patients were excluded from the study. Of the PD group, 12 were TD and 9 were PIGD. All patients were evaluated using the total MDS-UPDRS for clinical staging, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for cognitive evaluation, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for identification of psychiatric comorbidities. The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and patient consent followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### DTI imaging acquisition \n  \nMR imaging was performed on a 3T Signa HDxt MRI (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel brain phased- array head coil. 32-direction diffusion imaging was acquired with a spin echo, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence using the following parameters: FOV: 26 \u00d7 26 cm, TR/TE: 16000/92 ms, matrix size: 128 \u00d7 128, slice thickness: 2 mm, and   b  -values of 0 and 1000 s/mm . \n\n\n### Image analysis \n  \nImage analysis was performed using the FMRIB Software Library tools (FSL) ( ). Source diffusion data was initially pre-processed to remove the effects of eddy current distortions with the FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox (FDT). Using the FMRIB's DTIfit tool, the eddy current corrected diffusion data for each subject was processed to generate voxel-wise maps of FA, MD, AD, and RD. The FMRIB's Linear and Non-Linear Image Registration Tools (FLIRT followed by FNIRT) were then used to normalize each subject's FA maps to 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm  Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard space using the FMRIB58-FA template as the target. This non-linear transformation was performed to allow calculation of inverse normalizations (using the   invwarp   tool) for transposition of ROI masks to subject space as described below. \n\n\n### ROI masks \n  \nUsing the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural probabilistic atlas provided in FSLView, masks were extracted from the labels for the right and left caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus. The probabilistic masks for each structure were was then thresholded using the   fslmaths   tool to a probability of 80% to decrease the possibility of overlap with adjacent structures. As standard atlases such as the Harvard-Oxford atlas lack labels for the SN, the Atlas of the Basal Ganglia (ATAG) MNI 04 atlas (Keuken et al.,  ) was used to extract SN masks. First the atlas was downsampled from 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 0.4 to 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm  in MNI 152 space. Then, in a similar fashion to the caudate, putamen and globus pallidus, FSLView was then used to extract the standard space mask for each SN and   fslmaths   was used to threshold the resulting masks to 50%. \n\n\n### ROI transposition to subject space and quality assurance \n  \nThe FMRIB's   invwarp   tool was used to calculate the inverse warp of the previously described non-linear transformation of the FA maps to standard space. This inverse transformation was then used with the   applywarp   tool to de-normalize all eight thresholded, standard space masks to the subject space for each study participant. This was performed so that all data evaluation could be done in subject space to avoid possible data modification by the normalization process. A blinded quality assessment review was then performed by a board certified neuroradiologist (J.M.H.), in which the ROIs in subject space were superimposed on each subject's FA map to confirm the final accuracy of the ROI placement (Figure  ). From this review, six study subjects (four controls and two patients) had either one or two misaligned masks (right SN in two controls and one PD patient, right caudate in two controls and one PD patient, left SN in one PD patient and left caudate in one control and one PD patient). The misaligned ROIs were removed from subsequent analysis. \n  \n Representative axial fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from one subject showing the locations of the ROIs after transformation to subject space  . Blue, caudate nucleus; red, putamen; green, globus pallidus; yellow, substantia nigra. \n  \n\n### Extraction of DTI measures for analysis \n  \nFollowing the blinded qualitative assessment, the FMRIB's   fslstats   tool was used to apply the native space masks for each subcortical structure to the voxel wise maps of FA, MD, AD, and RD in each study subject and extract the mean values. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nDemographic variables were compared using two-tailed   t  -tests and chi-squared tests with significance was set to   p   < 0.05. Two sided Satterthwaite   T  -test contrasts were used to compare FA, MD, AD, and RD values of right and left deep gray matter structures in all PD patients vs. controls, with significance set to   p   < 0.05. To determine if DTI measures differ between PD subtypes, we used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with unequal variance and Satterthwaite degrees of freedom to test for a significant group effect across all groups and between each pairwise group comparison (TD vs. Controls, PIGD vs. Controls, and TD vs. PIGD). If the overall ANOVA   F  -test identified any differences among the three groups, then pairwise comparisons were made among the groups using a Tukey-Kramer adjustment for multiple comparisons. \n\nPartial Spearman's correlations by group (all PD patients, TD, and PIGD) and adjusted for age were used to check for post hoc correlations between FA and MD and disease duration (in years), disease stage (H&Y stage), and motor severity (MDS-UPDRS III) for those basal ganglia structures identified as having significant group differences in the ANOVA affecting at least one side. Clinical correlations with AD and RD were not tested in order to limit the overall number of correlations tested and to avoid multicollinearity issues as these measures were strongly correlated with MD in our control dataset (MD to AD with mean rho: 0.93 \u00b1 0.065; and MD to RD with mean rho: 0.98 \u00b1 0.017). \n\nAs patients with PD generally have an asymmetric onset and progression of their symptoms, we repeated our statistical analysis using an approach to try to control for the predominant symptom side and assess whether aligning the presumed more affected sides in patients altered our findings. To do this, patients who had their left side body (right brain) affected at onset had their brain data flipped right to left such that the left brain represented the presumably more affected side across PD patients. Similar statistical tests were then applied as described above with the exception that an average of the left and right sides was used for the healthy control values when making comparisons between PD patients and healthy controls. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Subject characteristics \n  \nHealthy controls (  N   = 20) and PD patients (  N   = 21) were closely matched in age (61.1 \u00b1 9.0 vs. 61.1 \u00b1 7.7,   p   =   0.97  ) and gender (11M:9F vs. 12M:9F,   p   = 0.89). Patient demographics broken down by motor subtype are shown in Table  . Disease severity ranged from mild to moderate (mean H&Y = 2.2 \u00b1 0.7). No significant differences in motor severity were seen, as per MDS-UPDRS III, in either \u201coff\u201d or \u201con\u201d medication states between TD and PIGD. No significant differences were identified between the groups in the MoCA (TD: 27.8 \u00b1 1.5, PIGD: 27.6 \u00b1 1.7;   p   = 0.79), BDI (TD: 8.5 \u00b1 5.3, PIGD: 7.8 \u00b1 6.4;   p   = 0.79), and NPI (TD: 2.2 \u00b1 1.8, PIGD: 3.1 \u00b1 3.4;   p   = 0.46). \n  \n Patient demographic data  . \n  \n Values shown as mean \u00b1 sd except where indicated. p-values calculated using two-tailed independent sample t-tests except for gender and initial side affected differences tested using chi-square test.

Additionally, PD patients had increased RD in the right SN (  p   = 0.022) and bilateral globus pallidus (left:   p   = 0.026  ;   right:   p   = 0.049). No significant differences were seen for the caudate or putamen. When adjusting data for predominant motor symptom side, reduced FA persisted in the SN ipsilateral to the more affected body side (  p   = 0.034) and a difference in FA in the SN contralateral to the more affected body side came close to being significant (  p   = 0.007). In addition, the findings of increased MD in the SN (contralateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.027; ipsilateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.008) and globus pallidus (contralateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.023; ipsilateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.021), as well as increased RD in the SN ipsilateral to the more affected side (  p   = 0.013) and bilateral globus pallidus (contralateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.025; ipsilateral to the more affected side:   p   = 0.025), were still present. \n  \n DTI measures across study subjects  . \n  \n Values shown as mean \u00b1 sd except where indicated. p-values calculated using two-tailed independent samples t-tests.

Pairwise comparisons showed that these differences were driven by the PIGD subtype and that no significant differences were seen between TD patients and controls (Table  , Figure  ). Similar group differences were seen in the right SN, but these did not reach significance. No significant differences across groups were seen for the caudate, putamen, or globus pallidus. When accounting for predominant motor symptom side, similar differences in DTI measures across groups were seen in the SN ipsilateral to the more affected side (FA:   F   = 6.6,   p   = 0.008; MD:   F   = 5.3,   p   = 0.018; RD:   F   = 5.5,   p   = 0.016). A difference across groups in MD within the globus pallidus contralateral to the more affected side also reached our significance threshold (  F   = 4.6,   p   = 0.021). For each of these findings, pairwise comparisons showed revealed that the group differences were driven by the PIGD subtype (Table  ). \n  \n Pairwise group comparisons of DTI measures in bilateral basal ganglia  . \n  \n F-and p-values calculated using ANOVA with unequal variance across controls, TD and PIGD groups.

Within TD, there were no significant correlations between DTI measures in the SN or globus pallidus and clinical measures. In the PIGD group, however, MD in the globus pallidus showed a positive correlation with H&Y disease stage (right:   r   = 0.764,   p   = 0.027) and MDS-UPDRS III scores (left: MD:   r   = 0.814,   p   = 0.014). After adjusting our data for the predominant motor symptom side, no significant correlations were found between FA in the SN and clinical assessments in the PD patients. In the PIGD group, MD in the globus pallidus ipsilateral to the more affected side was positively correlated with MDS-UPDRS III scores (  r   = 0.785,   p   = 0.021). No significant correlations were seen between any of DTI measures and disease duration either across or within subtypes. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results build upon prior reports of reduced FA and increased diffusivity measures within the SN in PD by demonstrating that such changes are much more prominent in PIGD patients than TD patients. Furthermore, increased MD in the globus pallidus in PD patients was also driven by the PIGD patients, and these changes correlated with disease stage and motor severity in patients with this motor subtype. \n\nDecreased FA along with increased MD and RD within the SN have been previously reported in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced murine PD model (Boska et al.,  ). In this study, RD and MD values correlated with the degree of depletion of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. In PD patients, decreased FA within the SN have also been detected using DTI. Cochrane and Ebmeier, in a meta-analysis of DTI studies and Parkinsonian syndromes, noted that 7 out of 9 PD studies reported significantly decreased nigral FA values (Cochrane and Ebmeier,  ) compared to controls. Schwarz et al. in another meta-analysis, described 9 out of 10 studies reporting decreased FA in the SN of PD patients, however, with a wide range of FA values reported (Schwarz et al.,  ). Although our absolute FA values were higher than those obtained from the standard reference DTI atlas in the report by Schwarz et al. they were comparable to a number of prior studies (Vaillancourt et al.,  ; P\u00e9ran et al.,  ; Du et al.,  ; Zhan et al.,  ). \n\nVaillacourt et al. recently reported that with accurate placement of SN ROIs, FA in the SN could separate PD patients and controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity (Vaillancourt et al.,  ). Given the neuropathologic hallmark of PD is the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (Rudow et al.,  ), our findings help further support that abnormal diffusivity measures in the SN stem directly from neurodegeneration of nigral neurons. A recent DTI study involving a large population of patients from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) however, failed to duplicate the degree of sensitivity in Vaillacourt's report despite using the same ROI drawing approach (Schuff et al.,  ). \n\nOnly a small number of DTI studies to date have reported microstructural abnormalities outside the SN in PD. Increased MD in the globus pallidus, in line with our findings, was reported by Kim et al. in a study using voxel-based Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS; Kim et al.,  ). In that study, findings also included increased diffusivity in the putamen, caudate, thalamus and multiple white matter tracts, despite absence of FA or MD changes in the SN. Pallidal changes in PD are further supported by a pathologic study by Rajput et al. who measured dopamine concentrations in the basal ganglia in post-mortem fresh brain tissue of PD patients using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (Rajput et al.,  ). Decreased levels of dopamine were found both in the internal and external globus pallidus of PD patients in comparison to healthy controls to a degree felt to be significant to impair normal motor function. \n\nWe found in our study here that significant group differences in FA, MD, and RD in the SN, as well as in MD in the globus pallidus, were driven by the PIGD motor subtype, suggesting that changes in DTI measures are larger in PD patients with predominant balance and gait impairment and not as prominent in tremor-dominant patients. Only a few studies have specifically compared DTI measures in these PD motor subtypes (Lenfeldt et al.,  ; Chan et al.,  ; Schuff et al.,  ). Lenfeldt et al. reported increased MD in the thalamus of TD patients compared to PIGD (Lenfeldt et al.,  ), raising the possibility that microstructural changes within structures outside the basal ganglia could differ between subtypes. No abnormalities were found in the SN or globus pallidus, however, possibly due to methodological differences in DTI acquisition and analysis as their investigation was performed using a 1.5T MRI scanner and two different DTI protocols (6 and 32 gradient directions) were used. \n\nIn a DTI study by Chan et al. ( ), FA within the SN did not significantly differ between PIGD compared to other PD patients and controls. The patients with the PIGD subtype, however, did show significant differences in FA within the transcallosal motor tract that differentiated them from more typical PD patients with tremor. Our evaluation was focused on the basal ganglia and not a whole brain analysis, possibly giving us greater power to detect differences between motor subtypes within the SN. In the recent PPMI-based DTI study noted above, PD patients were dichotomized as tremor dominant or non-tremor dominant and diffusion measures within the SN were evaluated (Schuff et al.,  ). While a tendency toward higher AD and RD values in the SN were seen in the non-tremor dominant patients, no significant FA changes were noted between the two groups. Although this study involved a larger cohort compared to our study, patients with an indeterminate motor subtype were combined with non-tremor dominant patients and subjects were recruited and scanned at 10 different sites potentially leading to greater variability within the data. Furthermore, the analysis focused only on the SN and the ROI placement was performed manually, which may be less reliable than our atlas-based approach. \n\nA post-mortem neuropathologic study by Jellinger et al. helps support our finding that microstructural changes in the SN may differentiate PD motor subtypes. In this study, significant differences in the pattern of distribution of dopaminergic neuronal loss, being predominantly ventrolateral in the SN pars compacta projecting to the dorsal putamen in PIGD and more medial in the SN projecting to the caudate nucleus and anterior putamen in TD (Jellinger,  ). In the present study we utilized probabilistic maps for automated ROI delineation of basal ganglia structures to minimize human interference and imprecisions from manual placement in each subject. The SN ROI we used was obtained from a probabilistic map generated using an ultra-high resolution Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) sequence with 0.5 mm isotropic voxels providing exquisite details to delineate the SN (Keuken et al.,  ). We set a fairly high threshold of up to 50% to the margins of the ROI to ensure that we were well within the confines of the SN. One drawback of this approach is that sub-regions of the SN, such as the rostral and caudal aspects, were not amenable to assessment. Further investigation using improved DTI techniques or a higher field strength MRI will be needed to help answer whether diffusion changes within sub-regions of the SN, as well as within other brainstem structures thought to contribute to postural instability and gait impairment such the pedunculopontine nucleus, underlie the differing motor manifestations in PD. \n\nIn our study we found that decreased FA within the SN in PD patients correlated with H&Y stage. Similar findings have been reported in prior DTI studies of PD patients (Chan et al.,  ; Prakash et al.,  ; Zhan et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). By investigating relationships between DTI and clinical measures by PD subtype, we also found that diffusivity changes in the globus pallidus of PIGD patients correlated with both H&Y stage and MDS-UPDRS III scores. When our data were adjusted for side of symptom onset, we no longer saw correlations between DTI measures and H&Y stage, but we continued to see a correlation between MD in the globus pallidus and motor severity as measured by MDS-UPDRS III. These findings suggest that greater structural disruption within the globus pallidus could underlie the more severe postural and gait impairments that define the PIGD subtype. This is supported by the study by Rajput et al. discussed above that found that PIGD patients have a greater reduction of dopamine in their globus pallidus overall when compared to healthy controls, TD patients, and PD patients with indeterminate motor subtype (Rajput et al.,  ). \n\nAdditional evidence of the importance of the globus pallidus in the phenotypic expression of PD comes from DBS literature. A meta-analysis of the long-term effects of DBS on motor symptoms conducted by George et al. found that PIGD patients had improvement in posture and gait following stimulation of both the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, but improvement in those patients with subthalamic stimulation was followed by a decline not observed with pallidal stimulation (St George et al.,  ). In contrast, in a recent re-analysis of a large DBS clinical trial taking into account the different motor subtypes (Katz et al.,  ), the authors concluded that while the overall response to DBS of either the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus did not significantly differ between motor phenotypes, TD patients may have greater improvement in gait with pallidal DBS. Although these studies provide a hint that the globus pallidus may be particularly important in regards to posture and gait in PD, further research is needed to determine its role in the expression of its different motor phenotypes. \n\nDespite revealing robust differences in DTI measures between PIGD and TD subtypes, our study is limited by a small sample size and so our results should be interpreted with caution. A larger DTI study of PD subtypes is needed to help confirm the validity of our findings and allow more stringent multiple comparison corrections to be applied. In addition, how alterations in FA and diffusivity relate to specific underlying neuropathological changes remains unclear. In a MPTP-induced PD animal model, decreased FA and increased MD, along with increased RD in the SN have been correlated to the degree of depletion of dopaminergic neurons along the nigrostriatal pathways (Boska et al.,  ). Dopamine levels, however, cannot be the only factor contributing to changes in DTI measures in PD as we found no significant differences in the caudate and putamen, which are known to harbor the greatest loss of dopaminergic nigral projections in PD (Rajput et al.,  ). \n\nChanges in morphology of cells such as demonstrated in pathologic studies in humans showing atrophy of the remaining pigmented cells in the SN in PD as opposed to hypertrophic cells seen in normal aging subjects (Rudow et al.,  ) could also account for our DTI findings. Adding complexity to the interpretation of our results, there are likely differences in the degree of damage within sub-regions of the basal ganglia in PD (Jellinger,  ; Rajput et al.,  ; Eggers et al.,  ). Furthermore, iron accumulation within the SN may have influenced our DTI processing, and due to the presence of iron methods such as quantitative susceptibility mapping could be a more sensitive means to image changes within the SN in PD (Du et al.,  ). \n\nIn conclusion, our results support that DTI can detect microstructural alterations in the SN and globus pallidus of PD patients, and suggest that such changes within the SN may be able to differentiate PIGD and TD motor subtypes. In addition, our findings suggest that diffusivity changes in the globus pallidus are particularly relevant to patients with the PIGD motor subtype and may more accurately reflect motor severity and disease stage than changes affecting the SN. Although our findings need to be validated in a larger population, they suggest further investigation into the role of the globus pallidus in PD motor subtypes could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying these different phenotypes. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLN Project conception and design; analysis of imaging data; drafting and revision of manuscript.

Although its cause remains unknown, its functional and structural analysis is fundamental to advance in the search of a cure or symptomatic treatment. The automatic segmentation of deep brain structures related to Parkinson`s disease could be beneficial for the follow up and treatment planning. Unfortunately, there is not broadly available segmentation software to automatically measure Parkinson related structures. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline to segment three deep brain structures related to Parkinson's disease (substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and red nucleus). The proposed method is based on the multi-atlas label fusion technology that works on standard and high-resolution T2-weighted images. The proposed method also includes as post-processing a new neural network-based error correction step to minimize systematic segmentation errors. The proposed method has been compared to other state-of-the-art methods showing competitive results in terms of accuracy and execution time. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative pathology after Alzheimer's disease. It is a slow progressive disease that affects about 0.3% of the total population and 1% in people over 60 years old, presenting about 100,000 new cases every year ( ). \n\nThe cause that triggers the disease is still unknown, but it is characterized mainly by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNpc), causing mostly motor symptoms, although neuron losses have also been found in other areas of the brain. There are several hypotheses about the cause of the death of these neurons, but none of them have been proven, which explains why a cure has not yet been found ( ). \n\nThe disease is the cause of various symptoms, mostly motor such as bradykinesia, muscle stiffness and tremors, commonly known and caused by the loss of dopaminergic innervation. However, it also causes some non-motor symptoms such as cognitive and sleep problems, pain, fatigue and depression that, despite not being so well known, reduce in the same way or even more the quality of life of patients suffering from this disease ( ). \n\nCurrently, there is no treatment that can cure or even slowdown the disease and current treatments are focused in the control of the symptoms ( ). A typical example is the use of levodopa to alleviate motor symptoms. However, it has been seen that the adverse effects of the medications used can affect the quality of life of patients, so long-term treatments must be controlled. Another very common treatment for Parkinson's symptoms, especially for tremor, is neurostimulation or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus due to its metabolic and electrophysiological activity. It is an alternative option when the patient does not respond to levodopa or simply to reduce the dose of the medication. It is a fairly widespread technique, but with a small risk in neurostimulatory implantation surgery ( ). Finally, a newer alternative therapy is the development of high intensity focal ultrasound (HIFU) guided by MRI, a non-invasive method that produces lesions in the subthalamic nucleus that ends with tremor ( ). \n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method to segment three deep brain structures related with Parkinson's disease (substantia nigra (SN), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and red nucleus (RN)). As already commented, the substantia nigra plays a major role in the disease due to the degeneration of dopaminergic cells. On the other hand, subthalamic nucleus which is located next to SN is also affected as this structure is highly connected to SN and is part of the basal ganglia circuit controlling motor actions (Parent and Hazrati, 1995). In fact, in patients with Parkinson's, metabolic and electrophysiological hyperactivity is found in STN ( ). It is believed to be caused by the imbalance in neurotransmission that would cause the loss of neurons in the SN, although various theories have been considered. That is why an injury in this area would reduce this activity to normal levels, which makes the STN a therapeutic target. Finally, the red nucleus is a structure located also close to the SN and is also related to the progression of the disease since it can have a compensatory role as long as the disease progresses ( ). \n\nDuring the last two decades, structures involved in Parkinson's disease have been studied for their special interest for early and objective diagnosis. That is why various automatic segmentation techniques have been developed in order to extract the volumes of these structures for diagnosis, as well as their location for a better treatment. Early methods for the automatic segmentation of structures involved in Parkinson`s disease were based on anatomical atlases, which consist of registering the case to segment to a template (atlas). In ( ) T1w images were used so the proposed method was limited to segment easily identifiable structures in this modality. However, soon it was found that \u200b\u200busing T2w or T2*w images are a better choice since structures involved in PD are more easily identifiable in those modalities ( ). Going a step forward, ( ) proposed to merge two modalities to further improve the results. \n\nIn ( ) three segmentation methods to segment basal ganglia and structures involved in PD were compared. Two of these methods were based on non-linear registration of manually labeled templates. The first is the Automatic Nonlinear Image Matching and Anatomical Labeling (ANIMAL) ( ), the second is based on the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) ( ) registration package and the third is a patch-based label fusion technique ( ), which despite using only an affine registration demonstrated very good performance. In 2014, ( ) proposed a multiatlas method where multiple manually labeled templates were non-linearly registered to the case under study using ANTS and the multiple labels were combined using a majority voting rule. A year later, they proposed other method based on double-contrast patches which used multivariable cross-correlation and label fusion to segment the SN, the STN and RN ( ). \n\nRecently, a Multimodal Image Segmentation Tool (MIST) method was proposed ( ), which segments the three structures involved in PD. This method used MR images acquired at a 7T MR machine to calculate their QSM (Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping). This method detects the edges of the structures according to their intensity and shape profiles so it only requires a single reference mesh and a set of unlabeled training volumes, with which it learns in an unsupervised way. Unfortunately, 7T machines are not widely available which limits its applicability in common research and clinical settings. \n\nIn this paper, we propose a fast multiatlas patch-based label fusion segmentation method. Our method uses OPAL ( ) to produces fast and accurate segmentations. The proposed method is based on high resolution (0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm ) T2w images but it also works on standard resolution T2w images (1\u00a0mm ) after a superresolution step ( ;  ). The proposed method also includes a systematic error corrector method earlier introduced in ( ) based on the use of a boosted ensemble of neural networks which reduces segmentation errors at post-processing. \n\n\n## Material and methods \n  \n### Image data \n  \nIn this work, we have used a high-resolution MR dataset to develop the proposed method and to evaluate the results. This dataset contains 5 MR subjects with 0.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.3\u00a0mm  high resolution T2-weighted images obtained by 2x interpolation of 0.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.6\u00a0mm  acquisitions. The HR images are publicly available at the CoBrALab website ( ). These MR images were taken from 5 healthy volunteers (2 males, 3 females, aged 29\u201357). High-resolution T2-weighted images were acquired using the 3D fast spin echo acquisition, FSE-CUBE (TE/TR=95.3\u00a0ms/2500\u00a0ms, ETL=100\u00a0ms, 2NEX, and isotropic resolution of 0.6\u00a0mm ). Reconstruction filters, ZIPX2 and ZIP512, were also used resulting in a final isotropic 0.3\u00a0mm  dimension voxels. For more details see the original paper ( ). This dataset was extended with 10 more cases using the same acquisition protocol and resolution kindly provided by the Dr. Chakravarty (See   for an example of one of these images).   \nExample of a HR T2 case from the Winterburn dataset. \n  Fig. 1.   \n\n\n### Proposed method \n  \nOur proposed approach is a multiatlas segmentation method that uses a library of manually labeled atlases to perform the segmentation process. \n\n#### Library construction \n  \nThe images used to build the system library were preprocessed to locate them in a common intensity and coordinate space. To this end, we applied the following steps:   \nRegistration: Affine registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) space using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ). This registration was estimated using a 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm  resolution T2w MNI152 template when processing high resolution images and using the standard 1\u00a0mm  resolution MNI152 template when dealing with standard resolution images. As we will describe later, the segmentation is always performed at 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm  resolution. \n  \nInhomogeneity correction: Intensity inhomogeneity correction is performed using the N4 bias field correction method ( ). \n  \nIntensity standardization: The images were intensity normalized so brain tissues have similar intensity levels across all the subjects of the library. For this purpose, we applied a histogram matching method ( ). \n  \nCropping: To reduce the memory requirements and the computational cost, the image was cropped around the area of interest. For this purpose, a bounding box surrounding the different structures of interest was calculated (using a margin of 5 voxels in each direction) in the MNI152 space from the manual segmentations to ensure that all the manual segmentations were included in this bounding box (see  ).   \nUpper row shows an example of the cropping operation and the following denoising. Bottom row shows an example of the result of the manual labeling process. \n  Fig. 2   \n  \nDenoising: A denoising step using the PRI-NLPCA Filter (Manj\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2015) is also done. We perform the denoising over the cropped region for efficiency reasons because applying it in the original volume would be too time consuming and totally unnecessary to analyze a small portion of the volume. \n  \nManual labeling: The 6 structures of interest (we assigned different labels for left and right structures) were manually segmented in the 15 library cases using ITK-SNAP software ( ). Taking benefit from the symmetric properties of the brain, the library size was duplicated by including the axially mirrored cases which lead to a total library size of 30 cases. All the images were manually segmented by a trained person (AB) and supervised by an expert in brain anatomy (EL) (see  ). \n  \nNon-linear registration: A non-linear deformation was estimated between the cropped region of every subject and a reference cropped MNI152 template. The non-linear deformation was estimated using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ) using cross correlation metric and pyramidal framework at 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01x scales and 200, 200, 200 and 0 iterations at each scale. For the library construction, the transformations were estimated and stored but no transformation was applied to the library cases since this operation is only done during the segmentation process as we will describe later. \n  \n\n\n#### New cases preprocessing \n  \nThe proposed method can be applied to both HR data and standard resolution data. Depending on this, the preprocessing pipeline is slightly different. When dealing with HR data the preprocessing steps were the same than for the library construction (steps 1 to 5). However, when standard resolution the preprocessing pipeline is the following:   \nDenoising: We used the Spatially Adaptive Non-local Means Filter ( ). \n  \nRegistration: Affine registration to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI152) space using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ). This registration was estimated using as reference the standard 1\u00a0mm  resolution T2w MNI152 template. \n  \nInhomogeneity correction: Intensity inhomogeneity correction using the N4 bias field correction ( ). \n  \nIntensity standardization: The images were intensity normalized using a histogram matching method ( ). \n  \nCropping: A standard resolution bounding box surrounding the different structures was applied to crop the region of interest at 1\u00a0mm  resolution. \n  \nSuperresolution: The cropped data must be upsampled to produce HR 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm  resolution data. This is performed using a patch-based super-resolution technique called LASR ( ). \n  \nNon-linear registration: To achieve a better match between the different subjects' anatomy, a non-linear deformation was estimated between the cropped regions of every subject and the reference cropped MNI152 template. The non-linear deformation is estimated with the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ( ) using cross correlation metric and pyramidal framework at 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01x scales and 200, 200, 200 and 0 iterations at each scale. This transformation will be used to create a subject-specific library. \n  \n\n\n#### Online subject-specific library construction \n  \nIn classical multi-atlas label fusion methods a common approach consists of non-linearly register all the manually labeled atlases to the new case to be segmented. However, this is a very time-consuming process, since it requires to estimate and apply   N   non-linear registrations ( ). In our proposed method, we generate a subject specific library by concatenating the direct non-linear transformation of every library case (previously estimated) to the MNI152 cropped template with the inverse non-linear transformations of the case to be segmented to the same template. In this way, we move the entire library (  N  \u00a0=\u00a030) to the new case space estimating only a single non-linear transformation online as done in a previous work ( ). This registration process introduces some blurring due to the interpolation used to apply the transformations. This has a negative impact in the segmentation step. For this reason, to enhance the images, we sharpened the images by adding the Laplacian of each image. \n\n\n#### Labeling \n  \nOur segmentation method is based on the non-local patch-based label fusion technique ( ) where patches of the subject to be segmented are compared with patches of the training library to look for similar patterns within a defined search volume to assign the proper label   v   as can be seen in equation 1. where   V   corresponds to the search area,   N   is the number of subjects in the template library,   y   is a possible label from the voxel   x   at the position   j   in the library subject   s   and   w(x , x )   is the patch similarity defined as: where   P(x )   is the patch centered at   x , P(x )   the patch centered at   x   in the templates and ||.||  is the normalized L2 norm (normalized by the number of elements) calculated from the distance between each pair of voxels from both patches   P(x )   and   P(x ). h   is a normalization parameter that is estimated from the minimum of all patch distances within the search area. \n\nHowever, exhaustive patch comparison process is very time consuming (even in reduced neighborhoods). To reduce the computational burden of this process, we have used a multiscale adaptation of the OPAL method ( ) previously proposed in ( ) which takes benefit from the concept of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Fields (ANNF). We refer the interested reader to the original paper for more details. \n\n\n#### Systematic error correction \n  \nAny segmentation method is subject to both random and systematic errors. The first error type can be typically minimized by using bootstrapped estimations. Luckily, non-local label fusion technique estimates the voxel label averaging the votes of many patches which naturally reduces the random classification error. Unfortunately, systematic errors cannot be reduced using this strategy since they are not random. However, this systematic bias can be learned and later use this knowledge to correct the segmentation output (Wang et\u00a0al., 2011). \n\nIn ( ), we proposed an error corrector method based on a patch-based ensemble of neural networks (PEC for Patch-based Ensemble Corrector) to increase the segmentation accuracy by reducing the systematic errors. Specifically, the neural network ensemble is trained with image patches of sizes 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 voxels (fully sampled) and 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 voxels (subsampled by skipping two voxels at each dimension) from T2w images, the automatic segmentations, a distance map value, and their x, y and z coordinates in MNI152 space. The distance map we used is calculated for the whole structure as the distance in voxels to the structure contour. This results in a feature vector of 112 features that are mapped to a patch of manual segmentations of size 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 voxels. We used a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers of size 83 and 55 neurons resulting in a network with a topology of 112\u00a0\u00d7\u00a083\u00a0\u00d7\u00a055\u00a0\u00d7\u00a027 neurons. An ensemble of 10 neural networks was trained using a boosting strategy. Each new network was trained with a different subset of data which was selected by giving a higher probability of appearance to the samples that were misclassified in the previous ensemble. \n\nWe have named the proposed pipeline as   pBrain  . In  , an outline of the proposed pipeline is presented.   \nSummary of the HR pBrain segmentation pipeline. First, the HR image is registered to HR MNI152 space, inhomogeneity corrected and intensity normalized. Later, the image is cropped and denoised and the case-specific library is constructed. Finally, the OPAL method is used to produce an initial segmentation which is later refined using PEC method. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n\n\n## Experiments and results \n  \nIn this section, the parameters of the proposed method and its results are presented. The method parameters have been adjusted using a leave-two out cross validation strategy (removing the case being evaluated and its mirrored version). To evaluate the segmentation accuracy, we have used the DICE coefficient ( ) measured in the MNI152 space. For the multiscale patch similarity we used patch sizes of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 and 11\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011 voxels, for each scale respectively and a mixing coefficient of 0.5. In OPAL, we used 64 independent Patch Matches with 4 iterations each. \n\n### High resolution results \n  \nIn   we show the results of the proposed method for each structure and the overall performance. As can be noted, left and right results are consistent for each structure (being the STN the less stable probably due to its small size).   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result without using Patch-based Ensemble Corrector. \n  Table 1   \n\nTo evaluate the impact of the proposed error corrector, we performed a 3-fold validation. The 30 library cases were split in 3 subsets of 10 cases. Two sets (20 cases) were used to train the error corrector and the remaining set was used to test the error corrector. This operation was repeated 3 times. Therefore, the 30 cases were used to estimate the results of the whole dataset. For each training set the automatic segmentations were produced using only a library of 18 cases from this training set. Results are summarized in  .   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result using Patch-based Ensemble Corrector. \n  Table 2   \n\nAs can be noted, the error corrector systematically improved the results of each structure and the overall performance. \n\n\n### Standard resolution results \n  \nThe proposed method works optimally with HR MR images but these sequences are not always available in research or in clinical environments. Therefore, it would be desirable to be able to analyze legacy data at standard resolution. For this reason, we have evaluated the method over standard resolution (1\u00a0mm ) images upsampled to 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm  using a super-resolution technique called LASR ( ). To do this, we reduced the resolution of the HR images by a factor 2 and later upsampled them using the SR method. \n\n shows the results of this experiment using the proposed method without PEC. As can be noticed, although the accuracy degrades from 0.88 to 0.86,   pBrain   can still produce competitive results when using standard resolution images.   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result on standard resolution data without using Patch-based Ensemble Corrector. \n  Table 3   \n\nTo evaluate the impact of the proposed error corrector on upsampled data, we performed a 3-fold validation but this time using super-resolved data instead of HR data. Results are summarized in  . In this case, the improvement of the results was even bigger than in the HR data case with an overall improvement of 3% compared to the 2% obtained with the HR data. It is interesting to note that although SR images are not comparable to HR data, the use of PEC helped to increase the accuracy to almost reach the HR results (0.89\u00a0vs 0.90). This important result shows that the proposed framework can efficiently process common 1\u00a0mm  MR data.   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result on standard resolution data using Patch-based Ensemble Corrector. \n  Table 4   \n\n\n### Method's meta-analysis \n  \nA direct comparison of the proposed method with related methods is not possible due to the use of different datasets. Therefore, we performed a method meta-analysis to locate then proposed method in its approximated context. We analyzed the proposed method   pBrain   with other related methods (both LR and HR results are provided). Specifically, we analyzed the methods proposed in ( ), three variants proposed by ( ), another method from ( ), two variants of the proposed method in ( ) and finally the MIST method ( ). We used published values provided by the authors in the corresponding papers. This analysis is only indicative since each method was evaluated in different conditions with different datasets and labeling protocols. However, we think it is important to provide this information to roughly locate the proposed method in its corresponding context.   shows the DICE index of the different methods included in the analysis.   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result for the different compared methods. \n  Table 5   \n\nAs can be noted,  ,   and   methods had a low performance (below 73%) compared with the rest of the methods.   results and specially   showed a much higher accuracy being the double contrast version (T1\u00a0+\u00a0T2*) the best performing method overall. The proposed method had the second (HR) and third position (LR) and the first position when comparing with similar single contrast methods (0.901\u00a0vs 0.886). For specific structures, the proposed method was the best performing for RN and SN among the methods but not for STN which is the smaller and more complex structure to segment. Again, we want to highlight the fact that this ordering is just for orientation purposes since our only aim is to remark that the proposed method is well located among best performing methods in bibliography. \n\nRegarding to the execution time, the whole HR pBrain pipeline takes less than 5\u00a0min (this time was estimated in a computer running windows 10 with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU at 3,4\u00a0GHz and 64 GB RAM). The method proposed in   has been reported to take 28\u00a0min (not including the preprocessing and the library creation). The rest of the compared methods didn't supply their processing times. \n\n\n### Clinical data validation \n  \nWhen evaluating a new pipeline one aspect that sometimes is not analyzed is how the proposed method generalizes to other data sources different from the training/test dataset. To evaluate this aspect, we automatically analyzed 7 clinical cases from the Hospital La Fe of Valencia (Spain). Written informed consent was obtained for the use of the data and the hospital institutional ethical board approved its retrospective use. This dataset was composed of 7 Parkinson patients (4 males, 3 females) with an age range of 55\u201375 years. They were acquired in Phillips Achieva 3T MR scanner using a HR 3D T2 Spin Eco sequence (matrix size was 320\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0320\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0575 voxels at a resolution of 0.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.4\u00a0mm ). \n\nThe images were automatically segmented using the proposed   pBrain   pipeline and the results were compared with manually annotated labels from our expert. The results can be seen in  . As can be noticed, the results are similar to those obtained in our training library despite the fact that these images belong to patients with Parkinson while the library was made exclusively with healthy subjects. This suggests that the proposed pipeline generalizes well to other data sources (including at least some current clinical acquisition protocols).   \nDICE results for each structure and overall result on the clinical dataset composed by PD patients. \n  Table 6   \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn this paper we have presented a novel pipeline for Parkinson's disease related structure segmentation. The proposed pipeline is able to work with both HR and standard resolution MR T2 images. It is based on a state of the art multiatlas label fusion segmentation framework that uses a library of manually annotated templates to segment the substantia nigra, the red nucleus and the subthalamic nucleus. \n\nWe have compared our proposed pipeline with related methods previously proposed in bibliography. Although a direct comparison is not possible due to the use of different labeling protocols and datasets (and field strengths) we showed that the proposed pipeline produces results on pair and many times improving the results of related methods. \n\nWe believe that one of the reasons for the improved performance of the proposed framework is the fact that it works at high resolution (0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0mm ). We think this is fundamental when dealing with such small structures were a single voxel error represents a 1\u00a0mm  volume error (in MNI space) while the same one voxel error at HR only represents a 0.125\u00a0mm  error. Although it is true that HR images are not widely available in clinic, we have shown that standard resolution can be effectively upsampled to HR providing very good results. \n\nAnother important factor that explains our competitive results is the use of a systematic error correction method early proposed in ( ) which uses an ensemble of patch-based neural networks (PEC). The use of PEC consistently improved the results for all the structures in both high and standard resolution cases having an execution time overload of just few seconds. \n\nThe proposed pipeline is also very efficient with mean running times around 5\u00a0min (around 6 times faster than a similar reported method). \n\nOur results on a small clinical dataset of patients with Parkinson`s disease reveal that the proposed method apparently provides similar results to those obtained in the training dataset, despite the fact that this dataset is solely formed with healthy cases with different MR machines/parameters. This suggests that the proposed method can be readily applied in different research and clinical conditions, although a much larger validation will be required. Structural brain imaging has been shown to be very useful for the accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease ( ). In addition, the neurodegenerative process underlying the disease is thought to start at least years before motor symptoms ( ), and thus our imaging method can also be helpful for early detection of the disease. Although most imaging studies have focused on the SN, the volume of the STN has been found to decrease with progression of Parkinson's disease, whereas that of the RN increases ( ), probably as a result of the compensatory role named above ( ). In conclusion, our automatic segmentation method to measure the volume of the SN, STN and RN can be useful for the early diagnosis of the disease, as well as for the research of the dynamics of the brain structural alterations originated by Parkinson's disease. \n\nEvidently, the proposed pipeline is not restricted to its use in Parkinson`s disease as it can be used to analyze the three segmented structures in many other neurological conditions as long as to study the normal brain aging. \n\nWe plan to deploy the proposed pipeline within our volBrain online platform (volbrain.upv.es) to make it freely accessible to the scientific community. As far as we know, this will be the first publically available pipeline for Parkinson-related structure segmentation and we hope that it will help the researchers to better analyze their data in an easy to use yet accurate and efficient manner. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nJ.M., R.V. and P.C. conceived the pipeline and designed the experiments.

Guidelines recommend that patients with an improvement in Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III score\u2009>\u200933% in the LCT receive DBS treatment. However, LCT results are affected by many factors, and only provide information on the immediate effectiveness of dopamine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between LCT outcome and brain imaging features of PD patients to determine whether the latter can be used to identify candidates for DBS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA total of 38 PD patients were enrolled in the study. Based on improvement in UPDRS-III score in the LCT, patients were divided into low improvement (PD-LCT-L) and high improvement (PD-LCT-H) groups. Each patient\u2019s neural network was reconstructed based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data using the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence similarity estimation method. The network was established with the multiple kernel support vector machine technique. We analyzed differences in individual morphologic brain networks and their global and local metrics to determine whether there were differences in the connectomes of PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe 2 groups were similar in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD levodopa responsiveness was 26.52%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47% in the PD-LCT-L group (N\u2009=\u200913) and 58.66%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.09% in the PD-LCT-H group (  N  \u2009=\u200925). There were no significant differences between groups in global and local metrics. There were 43 consensus connections that were affected in both groups; in PD-LCT-L patients, most of these connections were decreased whereas those related to the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and left cuneus were significantly increased. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nMorphologic brain network assessment is a valuable method for predicting levodopa responsiveness in PD patients, which can facilitate the selection of candidates for DBS. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative motor disorder and affects more than 6 million people worldwide ( ). It is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and pathologic formation of Louis corpuscles, leading to motor symptoms such as tremor, muscle stunting, movement retardation, and posture imbalance as well as non-motor manifestations such as sleep, olfactory, cognitive, and mental disorders and autonomic dysfunction ( ). According to epidemiologic studies conducted in Europe and the United States, the prevalence rate of PD is 1% in people over the age of 60\u2009years and\u2009>\u20094% in people over the age of 80\u2009years, with the rates expected to rise over the next few decades ( ). The diagnosis of PD is mainly made and the severity determined through clinical examination and follow-up ( ). In China, the treatment approach for PD is long-term, multidisciplinary integrated therapy ( ). \n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS), especially closed-loop or adaptive DBS, is an essential aspect of PD treatment ( ). Patients undergo brain imaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET-CT) before DBS is performed. The levodopa challenge test (LCT) is also widely recommended before the procedure ( ). A 30% or 33% improvement in Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III score in the LCT has been set as a threshold for selecting candidates for DBS ( ); however, it is unclear how this can predict the effectiveness of the DBS operation. It was reported that patients with a motor symptom improvement rate of <30% in the  -dopa impact test responded well to DBS ( ); and at our center, DBS was effective in some patients with <33% improvement in the LCT. As the LCT does not fully reflect brain function, it is important to establish other methods for predicting the response of PD patients to DBS. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have revealed structural and functional alterations in multiple brain networks in PD ( ). For example, changes in the brain network observed by  F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT can be used for PD diagnosis and treatment selection for patients ( ) Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a relatively new approach for analyzing MRI data that has objective and quantitative advantages ( ). The aim of this study was to determine whether morphologic brain network changes observed by MRI and VBM in patients with PD are associated with LCT results, and can thus be used to identify patients who are likely to respond well to DBS. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Study population \n  \nA total of 38 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD according to International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society diagnostic criteria were retrospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent implantation surgery for DBS at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University from January 2020 to December 2021. Patients with a history of head trauma, stroke, intracranial tumor, hydrocephalus, and psychiatric illness were excluded. Medical records were thoroughly reviewed to collect detailed information. Written, informed consent was provided by each patient or their legal guardians. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Huashan Hospital and Medical Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The procedures used in this study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### LCT \n  \nThe LCT was administered to patients by experienced neurologists at Huashan Hospital. To induce the \u201coff\u201d medication state, dopamine receptor agonists were stopped 72\u2009h before the test, followed by levedopa and other dopaminergic medications 12\u2009h before the test. After the first evaluation of UPDRS-III score as the \u201coff\u201d baseline, 10\u2009mg domperidone was administered orally, followed by a dose of 150% of the standard first morning levodopa equivalent dose 30\u2009min later. UPDRS-III score was assessed every 30\u2009min until 4\u2009h after levodopa intake. The lowest score was recorded as the peak \u201con\u201d value. Levodopa responsiveness (LR) was calculated as follows: % LR\u2009=\u2009(\u201coff\u201d UPDRS-III score\u2009\u2212\u2009peak \u201con\u201d UPDRS-III score) / \u201coff\u201d UPDRS-III score \u00d7 100%. During the test, patients\u2019 heart rate and blood pressure were monitored and any adverse events were recorded. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nMRI was performed on an 3\u2009T Ingenia scanner (Koninklijke Philips N.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Structural 3D T1-weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: axial section thickness, 1.0\u2009mm; no gap; repetition time, 6,900\u2009ms; echo time, 2.9\u2009ms; field of view, 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009224\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u2009170\u2009mm; matrix size, 240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u2009\u00d7\u2009170; voxel size, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009mm ; and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 1.004. Imaging data were preprocessed using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12;  ) from Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12;  ). Gray matter (GM) was segmented with default parameters and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space, followed by nonlinear modulation to compensate for potential bias. After these steps, a GM volume map was obtained for each subject (a voxel size of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm). Spatial smoothing (Gaussian kernel with 6-mm full width at half maximum) was further applied to enhance the SNR of the GM volume map of each patient (voxel size of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u2009mm). The cerebral cortex was divided into 90 regions (45 per cerebellar hemisphere) based on automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) ( ). \n\n\n### Individual Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence similarity estimation morphologic brain network construction \n  \nEarly-stage PD with cognitive impairment can be predicted based on topologically convergent and divergent GM networks ( ). The distribution divergence-based method has been used in morphologic brain network investigations including in PD ( ;  ;  ). Specifically, Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence ( ) was applied to construct the network according to the following formula: \n\nwhere P and Q represent probability density functions (PDFs) of voxel intensities from a pair of regions of interest (ROIs). We applied the JSSE to construct individual mathematical relationships for any 2 ROIs to achieve a more accurate and symmetric estimate of morphologic brain connectivity. Based on the ROI parcellation from the AAL atlas, a 90\u2009\u00d7\u200990 region correlation matrix was generated for each patient and the intensity of the ROI was extracted to estimate the corresponding PDF. Morphologic connections were derived as the JS divergence (relative entropy) using the following equation: \n\nwhere   are the KL divergence. The JS divergence was used as a measure of morphologic connectivity to generate the adjacency matrix. \n\n\n### Computation of graph metrics \n  \nGlobal and local graph metrics of the morphologic brain network were determined by graph theoretical network analysis ( ) to evaluate individual connectivity patterns. Global graph metrics included clustering coefficient (Cp), small world (\u03c3), global efficiency (E ), local efficiency (E ), characteristic path length (Lp), normalized clustering coefficient (\u03b3), normalized characteristic path length (\u03bb), and modularity score ( ) and also assortativity, and nodal graph metrics included degree centrality (DC), nodal efficiency (Ne), betweenness centrality (BC), shortest path length, and nodal clustering coefficient ( ).In this study, synchronization had been adopt. Before calculating the sum of the corresponding node attribute values under the sparse threshold, we compared the network size of different sparse thresholds (0.02\u20130.5 in steps of 0.01). We then applied the sum of the values of each node as an attribute to train the classifier so that only one value corresponded to a graphical measure. \n\n\n### Feature combination \n  \nIn order to more accurately predict levodopa responsiveness, connection weight, global metrics, and nodal metrics were combined with the multikernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) technique ( ). In a case with   n   training samples with connection values and graph metrics, ,  , and   represented the connection weight, global metrics, and nodal metrics, respectively, of the   i   sample. With  as the corresponding label, the following problem was solved: \n\nwhere   represents the transform from the original space in   m   data to the Represent Hilbert Kernel Space (RHKS),   is the hyperplane in RHKS, and   is the corresponding combined weight of the   m  h attribute. The dual form of MK-SVM is represented as follows: \n\nwhere   is the kernel matrix of the   m  th data. After training the model, we tested the new sample:   x  . The kernel between the new test sample and   i  th training sample in the   m  th modality was defined as  . \n\nThe predictive level based on MK-SVM was formulated using the following equation. \n\nTo evaluate the gain in predictive performance of the combined information (ie, connection and global and nodal graph metrics in addition to LCT results), we employed the most commonly used and simplest linear kernel   according to the following equation. \n\n\n### Feature selection and validation \n  \nTo determine whether there were differences between the 2 groups, the strictest nested leave-one-out cross-validation (CV) ( ) was used in the construction of connections by combining the information from connection weights and global and nodal graph metrics. \n\nAll data processing and classification procedures used in the study are shown in  . \n  \nData-processing and classification procedures adopted in the study. The JSSE was chosen to construct the morphological network. Then, the nodal and global graph metrics were computed. In the end,the MK-SVM was adopted to combine these information for comparison. \n  \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population \n  \nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in  . Age, education, and sex distribution were similar between the 2 groups. According to the results of the LCT, patients were divided into PD-LCT-L (UPDRS-III score improvement rate\u2009\u2264\u200933%) and PD-LCT-H (UPDRS-III score improvement rate\u2009>\u200933%). \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. \n  \nValues are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD or   n  . \n\nPD-LCT-H, Parkinson disease patients with high improvement on the levodopa challenge test; LCT-L, Parkinson disease patients with low improvement on the levodopa challenge test. \n  \n\n### Global and local graph metrics of the brain connectome \n  \nThe global graph metrics of the PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups are shown in  . Compared with the PD-LCT-H group, hierarchy (   Hr   ) was increased whereas assortativity, Cp, E , E , Lp, modularity score, synchronization,   and  were decreased in the PD-LCT-L group. However, the differences were not statistically significant ( ). \n  \nGlobal and local graph metrics of the brain connectome. \n  \n, assortativity;  , clustering coefficient;  , global efficiency;  , local efficiency;  , hierarchy;  , characteristic path length; PD-LCT-H, Parkinson disease patients with high improvement on the levodopa challenge test; LCT-L, Parkinson disease patients with low improvement on the levodopa challenge test;  , modularity score;  , synchronization; \u03b3, normalized clustering coefficient; \u03bb, normalized characteristic path length; \u03c3, small-world. \n  \n\n### Consensus connections of the morphologic brain connectome \n  \nAs mentioned above, we selected consensus connections with   in each inner CV loop. As the selected connections in each loop could differ, we recorded all selected features during the entire training process\u2014i.e., consensus connections. Specifically, we selected significant consensus connections with   in each loop for a total of 43 ( ). Most of these were decreased in PD-LCT-L patients, except for those in the frontal and temporal lobe regions, which were increased. Significant consensus connections in the thalamus and putamen differed significantly between the 2 groups. \n  \nConsensus connections. \n  \nHG.R, right parahippocampal gyrus; THA.R, right thalamus. CUN.R, right cuneus; THA.L, left thalamus; MTG.L, left middle temporal gyrus; ORBsup.L, left superior frontal gyrus; AMYG.L, left amygdala; PCG.R, right posterior cingulate gyrus; HIP.L, left hippocampus; Cun.R, right cuneus; IPL.R, inferior parietal, but supramarginal and angular gyri; DCG.L, left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri; CAU.L, left caudate nucleus; STG,L, left superior temporal gyrus. \n  \n\n### Degree analysis of the morphologic brain connectome \n  \nWe visualized the mean degree of each node in the PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups to compare the degree distribution of the estimated brain connectomes. Specifically, there were 6 significant nodes with the average degree in the PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups ( ). Nodes with a standard deviation degree higher than the mean of the degree of all nodes were identified as degree hub nodes. A comparison of hub nodes between 2 groups in the same modal network revealed that most overlapped. There were also several hub nodes that corresponded to specific groups. \n  \nSix significant nodes with average degree. \n  \nAMYG.L, left amygdala; CUN.L, left cuneus; FFG.L, left fusiform gyrus; INS.L, left insula; LCT-H, high improvement on the levodopa challenge test; LCT-L, low improvement on the levodopa challenge test; MFG.L, left middle frontal gyrus; PoCG.L, left posterior cingulate gyrus. \n  \n\n### BC analysis of the morphologic brain connectome \n  \nTo investigate the BC of the estimated morphologic brain connectome, 5 significant nodes with average betweenness in the PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups were examined ( ). The betweenness of left anterior cingulate cortex, left amygdala, left temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus, and right parahippocampal gyrus tended to decrease in the PD-LCT-L group compared with the PD-LCT-H group, whereas that of the left precuneus tended to increase. \n  \nBetweenness centrality. \n  \nACG.L, left anterior cingulate cortex; AMYG.L, left amygdala; LCT-H, high improvement on the levodopa challenge test; LCT-L, low improvement on the levodopa challenge test; PCUN.L, left precuneus; PHG.R, right parahippocampal gyrus; TPOsup.L, left temporal pole of the superior temporal gyrus. \n  \n\n### Ne and nodal local efficiency analysis of the morphological brain connectome \n  \nThe Ne values of 4 significant nodes in the PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H groups are listed in  . The Ne of the left middle frontal gyrus, left insula, and right thalamus showed a decreasing tendency in the PD-LCT-L group, whereas the Ne of the left precuneus showed the opposite trend. Meanwhile, NLe of the right pallidum and left thalamus tended to decrease whereas both Ne and NLe of the left fusiform gyrus increased in the PD-LCT-L group compared with the PD-LCT-R group. \n  \nNodal efficiency and nodal local efficiency. \n  \nFFG.L, left fusiform gyrus; INS.L, left insula; LCT-H, high improvement on the levodopa challenge test; LCT-L, low improvement on the levodopa challenge test; MFG.L, left middle frontal gyrus; Ne, nodal efficiency; NLe, nodal local efficiency; PAL.R, right pallidum; THA.L, left thalamus; THA.R, right thalamus. \n  \n\n### Classification performance \n  \nWe evaluated the classification performance of the combined information and proposed JSSE method based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, which were calculated with the following equations: \n\nwhere is true positive (ie, number of positive subjects correctly classified in the identification task); FP is false positive (number of negative subjects that were incorrectly classified in the identification task); and TN and FN are the number of true negative and false negative subjects, respectively (see  ). \n  \nClassification performance corresponding to different methods. \n  \nSEN, sensitity; SPE, specificity \n  \nTo validate the combined information results, we also determined the single-kernel SVM classification based on connection and global and nodal metrics. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the performance of the combined information results were superior to that of the global metric ( ). However, the combination of connection, global metrics, and nodal metrics did not outperform the results obtained using all 4 measurements (ie, including the LCT results). \n  \nThe ROC results of different methods. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe diagnosis of PD is mainly symptom-based. The heterogeneity of clinical presentation and disease course in PD reflects a complex pathogenesis and can determine the most effective treatment. Stratifying PD patients can facilitate the selection of individually tailored treatment strategies. This study investigated whether morphologic brain networks identified by MRI and analyzed by JSSE can predict the response to DBS in PD patients stratified according to improvement rates in the LCT. The results showed that while there were no significant differences in global graph metrics, the 2 groups differed with respect to DC, BC, Ne, NLe, NCp, and NLp. Thus, combining morphologic brain network characteristics and LCT results can provide detailed information regarding disease state in individual PD patients. Moreover, JSSE applied to T1-weighted MRI data can reveal inter-individual differences in brain connectivity that can inform treatment selection for patients with PD. \n\nLCT is a valuable tool for identifying the optimal treatment for PD and is required prior to DBS. However, the test has certain limitations. First, there is no absolute standard for the results. An LR of 30% was proposed based on a placebo effect observed in one-third of patients, but a value of 33% was set in the Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations and Core Assessment Program for Surgical Interventional Therapies in Parkinson\u2019s Disease preoperative protocols ( ); the latter value had moderately high sensitivity and a specificity of 70% for chronic levodopa, with a positive predictive value of 92.3% and negative predictive value of 32.1% ( ). Second, LCT results can set certain expectations for operators, follow-up regulators, and patients ( ). However, LCT results may be biased by the patient\u2019s long-term oral drug use as well as psychological and other factors ( ). Third, higher-than-usual doses of drug can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic drugs can lead to neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like events in PD patients ( ). Other factors such as oral drug dose and test time can also affect the results. For these reasons, most neurosurgeons base their assessment of the patient\u2019s condition and the choice of treatment strategy on other modalities in addition to the LCT ( ). In this study, the LCT was typically administered early in the morning when the patient was in a fasting state, and a dose of 150% of the standard morning levodopa dose was used. Improvement in motor scores compared with the \u201coff\u201d state was evaluated every 30\u2009min for 4\u2009h. Several patients complained of gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness. \n\nHigh-resolution (3.0\u2009T or 7.0\u2009T) MRI can provide information on pathologic changes in the brain of PD patients ( ). Previous brain network-related studies in PD patients have mainly focused on diagnosis; analyzing the relationship between GM network topology and the GM network determined from imaging data and disease severity can provide greater resolution for early diagnosis ( ). PD patients have higher E  and E  than normal subjects, which are unrelated to their clinical features ( ). In studies investigating PD-associated patterns in metabolic brain networks, relatively overactive areas were considered as the source of PD brain network dysfunction ( ). Some studies on the efficacy of DBS surgery found that structural and functional connectivities were independent predictors of clinical improvement ( ). However, there have been no studies on the correlation between dopamine impact tests and brain networks. Our results confirm that the morphologic brain network of PD patients with different LCT test results have certain differences that warrant closer examination in future studies. \n\nAll patients enrolled in our study were diagnosed with PD by at least 1 neurologist and 1 neurosurgeon. T1-weighted MRI data were acquired before subthalamic nucleus DBS surgery. The graph theory was applied to examine individual morphologic brain networks. Both groups of patients exhibited small-world properties for global and local graph metrics of the brain connectome, and the groups did not differ in terms of nodes and global graph metrics, consistent with previous research ( ). This suggests that information transmission efficiency in the whole brain was reduced in the early stage of PD disease and remained relatively stable with disease progression. We also found that the connectivity of many brain areas was weaker in the PD-LCT-L group than in the PD-LCT-H group, especially in the temporal lobe, limbic system, and thalamus, reflecting damage to these areas associated with low improvement in the LCT. Connection between the thalamus and cuneus were also altered in the PD-LCT-L group, which has been reported in patients suffering from both PD and cognitive impairment ( ). A correlation has been observed between atrophy of thalamic neurons, reduced thalamic volume, and cognitive function ( ). As a key hub of the default mode network, the precuneus is involved in many advanced cognitive functions; impaired connections in the precuneus reflected a decline in the cognitive level of patients in the PD-LCT-L group. Among indicators of complex network operation, the cluster coefficient measures the degree of collectivization of the network, node degree describes centrality in the network, and E  and E  represent the network\u2019s global and local transmission capacities, respectively ( ). \n\nCompared with the PD-LCT-H group, the PD-LCT-L group showed increased connectivity in a few areas of the frontal and temporal lobes, and the cluster coefficients of the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus and DC, Ne, and NLe of the left fusiform gyrus were increased; moreover, the DC of the left cuneus and left postcentral gyrus and BC of the precuneus were also increased. These brain regions are all related to cognition and movement.From the  , we observed that the brain areas with increased connectivity in the PD-LCT-L group tended to be on the left side rather than on the right, and the left fusiform gyrus connectome showed a compensatory increase in connectivity. In terms of consensus connections, the right parahippocampal gyrus\u2013right thalamus network was the most prominent. As the main cortical input to the hippocampus, this pathway plays an important role in cognition and emotion, which explains the anxiety and depression observed in patients with poor drug control ( ). Another important pathway for consensus connections identified in our study was the orbitofrontal cortex\u2013amygdala and Heschl\u2019s gyrus. The orbitofrontal cortex is essential for processing visual, spatial, and emotional information ( ). We found that this brain area was closely linked to the parietal occipital lobe and was also a central node in the morphologic brain network. Heschl\u2019s gyrus is located in the primary auditory cortex, occupying Brodmann areas 41 and 42; it is the first cortical structure to process incoming auditory information ( ). We observed significant differences in mood, anxiety, and depression between PD-LCT-L and PD-LCT-H patients; the connection networks related to motor disorders validated in our study may provide insight into the pathophysiology of certain emotional disorders and their relationship to clinical symptoms in PD. We also found that the connection between the thalamus and putamen differed between the 2 groups, with fewer connections in the PD-LCT-L group; this was previously shown to be related to the degree of cognitive dysfunction and tremor severity in some patients with PD ( ;  ,  ). Taken together, these findings provide an anatomic basis for evaluating the clinical symptoms of PD as well as potential imaging biomarkers for diagnosis. \n  \nThe most consensus connections mapped on the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) 152 template using the BrainNet Viewer software package   and circularGraph, shared by Paul Kassebaumb  . The connectivity matrices of the fully connected network of PD-LCT -L compared to PD-LCT-H are shown. The 43 most significant connections were retained. \n  \nThere were several limitation to this study.We havenot adopt multiple comparison correction analysis, such as Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate correction, and we will promote in the future work. Additionally, the data were analyzed retrospectively and could not be stratified according to different PD clinical symptoms. A control cohort would be explored in future investigations. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe results of this study show that JSSE based on MRI data can be used in conjunction with LCT results to identify candidates for DBS among patients with PD. Our findings also provide new insight into abnormalities in the morphologic brain network in PD that can inform individualized treatment decisions. \n\n\n## Data availability statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Ethics statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Huashan Hospital.

The rADC value was determined in different brain regions, including the dorsal putamen (DP) and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP). \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nThe rADC values of the DP showed a greater increase in MSA-p patients than in PD patients (  p  =0.03). MSA-p patients also presented increased rADC values of the MCP compared with PD patients (  p  =0.0001). In particular, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of the MCP rADC were higher than those of the DP rADC. However, DP and MCP rADC values were not correlated with clinical features in either MSA or PD patients. \n\n\n## Conclusions: \n  \nDWI discriminated between PD and MSA-p based on rADC values in DP and MCP. The MCP rADC value, in particular, could better discriminate MSA-p from PD. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-p) are neurodegenerative disorders. Despite consensus criteria for the diagnosis of PD  and MSA,  differential diagnosis remains a challenge for neurologists. \n\nSince 1986, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played an important role in diagnosing some neurodegenerative diseases ,  and has also been used for differential diagnosis between PD and MSA-p. Because MR images in PD patients are generally normal, the diagnostic value of brain MRI for PD was limited.  In advanced PD, however, MRI can reveal atrophy of the substantial nigra pars compacta (SNpc).  In addition, MRI changes in PD include smudging towards the red nucleus (RN) of the anterior hypointensity, due to deposition of iron in the pars reticulate, which also involves the medial part of the cerebral peduncle.  The MRI findings differentiating multiple system atrophy (MSA) from PD patients not only include a hyperintense rim at the putaminal edge and putaminal atrophy supratentorially but also infra-tentorial atrophy and signal change of the pons and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP). , ,  Atrophy of the SNpc revealed by the smudging of the hypointensity towards the RN may also be seen in patients with MSA.  Despite relatively high sensitivity and specificity of conventional MRI for differentiation between PD and MSA,  it is very difficult to differentiate patients with both parkinsonian symptoms and atrophy of the SN. \n\nRecently, interest in different MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), for differential diagnosis between PD and MSA-p has increased. DWI visualizes the random translation movement of water molecules in the tissue by applying diffusion-sensitized gradients between two radio-frequency pulses. ,  DWI enables the assessment of the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), a measure of tissue water diffusivity, and may detect changes in the microstructural integrity of nervous tissue earlier than conventional T1-or T2-weighted MRI.  Regional ADC (rADC) depends on the interactions between water molecules and the chemical environment as well as the structural barriers at the cellular and subcellular level hindering their motion   in vivo  .  A change of rADC is presumed to reflect ultrastructural tissue damage.  Pathological processes that modify tissue integrity, as in neurodegenerative disorders, result in an increased rADC.  The rADC value in DWI can help to distinguish MSA-p from PD by a high and normal putaminal rADC, respectively.  Increased diffusivity has also been found in the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus in MSA-p compared to PD patients and controls, probably reflecting the spreading neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia.  In addition increased rADC values in the MCP, which were usually found in MSA-c patients,  were also found in the MSA-p patients. \n\nWe compared the rADC values of DWI in the dorsal putamen (DP) and MCP to obtain a differential diagnosis between PD, MSA-p patients and normal controls. In addition, we analyzed to what extent MSA-p and PD could be differentiated. Lastly, we measured the correlation between clinical characteristics and rADC values in patients with both PD and MSA-p. \n\n\n## Subjects and Methods \n  \n### Patients \n  \nTwenty-two patients, comprised of 12 patients with PD and 10 patients with MSA-p, and 10 age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Diagnosis of PD and MSA-p was performed by an experienced movement disorder specialist using established diagnostic criteria.  Disease severity and stages of all patients were quantified using the motor scale (part III) of the United Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)  and the Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y) stage.  None of the control subjects had structural MRI abnormalities or a history of neurological problems or psychiatric disease. None of the patients had a previous history of secondary parkinsonism by drugs or toxins. All patients undergo conventional brain MRI to exclude cerebrovascular disease such as cerebral infarction and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Informed consent was obtained from each patient and healthy volunteers. \n\n\n### MRI protocol \n  \nAll subjects, including PD and MSA patients and normal controls were studied in a 1.5 tesla GE Signa MRI system (Echospeed, General Electrics Co, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Routine structural imaging included T1-weighted (repetition time [TR]/400 ms, echo time [TE]/9 ms, matrix 256\u00d7192 pixels) and T2-weighted (TR/2,000 ms, TE/120 ms, matrix 256\u00d7256 pixels) spin echo (SE) images (field of view=20\u00d720 cm, 6 mm thickness, 1 mm gap, number of excitation 2). Routine T1- and T2-weighted SE images were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist blinded to the clinical diagnosis. In all cases, axial DWI was conducted using a SE-EPI sequence (TR/10,000 ms, TE/120 ms, field of view 24\u00d724 cm, matrix 128\u00d7128 pixels, slice thickness 6 mm, slice gap 1 mm, scan acquisition time 40 s) with diffusion-sensitizing gradients applied along three   x  ,   y   and   z   orthogonal directions, using b factors of 1,000 s/mm .  In addition, images (b factor of 0 s/mm ) without diffusion weighting were acquired and exhibited T2-contrast. \n\n\n### ADC data analysis \n  \nADC maps were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis, assuming a signal dependence of the form S=S  exp (-b\u00d7ADC), where S and So represent the signal intensities with (S) and without (S ) diffusion sensitization.  The threshold of the ADC value was obtained at an arbitrary level to exclude pixels predominantly containing cerebrospinal fluid. The ADC maps were analyzed by the calculation of mean rADC values in each elliptical region of interest (ROI), which were placed in the left and right MCP as well as the DP. Maps of the mean rADC values were generated by calculating the mean of three   x  ,   y   and z orthogonal directions. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nStatistical comparison of each clinical item between all groups was performed with the \u03c7  test and Fisher\u2019s exact test. Comparison of mean rADC values was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by post hoc analysis corrected according to Bonferroni and Tukey for multiple comparisons. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and the positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of the mean rADC values for the DP and MCP for differential diagnosis, the optimal cut-off values of the mean rADCs were calculated by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve approach. The relationship between the mean rADC and parkinsonian symptoms was evaluated using the Pearson correlation and/or Spearman correlation test.   p  <0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Patients \n  \nThere was no difference in the sex distribution (  p  =0.09) or age (  p  =0.715) among PD, MSA-p and control patients. Furthermore, age at onset, disease duration, H & Y stage and UPDRS motor scores did not reveal a significant difference between PD and MSA-p patients ( ). \n\n\n### Diffusion-weighted imaging findings \n  \nNone of the PD patients had visually structural MRI abnormalities, whereas all of the MSA-p patients presented atrophy in the striatum, brainstem and/or cerebellum with small differences of degree. DP and MCP rADC values were significantly different among groups (DP rADC,   p  =0.02; MCP rADC,   p  =0.0001). The pair-wise comparison revealed high DP rADC values in MSA-p patients compared with PD patients (  p  =0.03) and control (  p  =0.005). Patients with MSA-p showed increased rADC values in the MCP patients compared with PD patients (  p  =0.0001) and controls (  p  =0.0001). However, DP and MCP rADC values were not significantly different between PD patients and controls (DP rADC,   p  = 0.7; MCP rADC,   p  =0.66, respectively)( ). \n\nTo calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the rADC values of the DP and MCP patients for differential diagnosis of MSA-p from PD, we used the cut-off values of 0.8225\u00d710  mm /s for DP rADC and 0.834\u00d710  mm /s for MCP rADC with ROC curve analysis. The DP rADC values differentiated MSA-p from PD with a sensitivity of 66.67%, a specificity of 80%, and a PPV of 80%. The MCP rADC values differentiated MSA-p from PD with a sensitivity of 91.67%, a specificity of 100% and a PPV of 100% ( ). \n\n\n### Correlation of rADC with clinical scores \n  \nNo correlation was found between DP or MCP rADC values and clinical features for either PD or MSA patients ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nBoth DP and MCP rADC values were higher in the MSA-p patients than in PD patients or normal controls. Consistent with other recently published studies, ,  our results show that rADC values can be used to differentially diagnose MSA-p from PD and healthy controls. The putamen and MCP of MSA-p patients are known to be representative regions for rADC values in the differential diagnosis of MSA-p and PD patients. ,  As previously stated, DWI can detect loss of tissue integrity by showing regions with an increased ADC value due to increased water movement. \n\nWe have focused on the identification of the rADC as a diagnostic marker helpful in the differential diagnosis between MSA-p and PD. In our study, MCP rADC values can distinguish MSA-p from PD patients with 91.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas DP rADC measurement showed a slightly lower sensitivity and specificity (66.67% vs. 80%, respectively). The positive and negative predictive values for the rADC of MCP were also higher than those of DP. To date, there have been no studies showing that DP and MCP rADC values can be used to discriminate MSA-p and PD. Our results suggest that MSA-p is related to a wider neurodegeneration over the whole brain, as compared to PD. \n\nIn a previous study, extrapyramidal symptoms, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, in MSA were shown to be associated with atrophy of the putamen, and the degree of atrophy in the pontocerebellar system was significantly correlated with the severity of truncal ataxia.  We hypothesized, therefore, that an increased DP rADC value, which has been suggested to be related to neuronal degeneration or neuronal tissue atrophy of the putamen, would correlate with extrapyramidal symptoms, such as bradykinesia or rigidity, in MAS patients and that an increased MCP rADC value would be related to axial symptoms, such as standing from a sitting position, posture, gait or postural reflex, in the same patients. However, none of the DP and MCP rADC values were related to any clinical features in MSA patients or PD patients. In addition, DP and MCP rADC values were not correlated with the severity and duration of disease of MSA patients. There are a number of possible explanations for these results. First, \u201cgait\u201d in the UPDRS motor scale does not sufficiently reflect the major gait problem of MSA, which is usually ataxia. Second, the gait problem in MSA is associated with multiple lesions that extend from the MCP. Third, disease duration is slightly, but not significantly, longer in PD than MSA. \n\nLastly, the limitation of our study was that the number of PD and MSA patients was too small to reflect the diagnostic potential of our results. This point was not the reason that we were unable to find a correlation between DP and MCP rADC values with clinical scores in PD and MSA patients, respectively. The second limitation of our study was that multiple cerebral regions were not included in our study. In fact, many other structures such as the thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, frontal or prefrontal white matter within the cortico-basal ganglia circuit were not analyzed. We believe that the second point was responsible for the negative correlation between rADC value and clinical features, especially in the MSA patients. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4027714, "text_md5": "4859513aefc531ea02113688606beb1e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 124], "journal": [125, 137], "publication_year": [139, 143], "title": [154, 287], "keywords": [301, 372], "abstract": [385, 1719], "body": [1728, 13557]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 24868359, "doi": "10.14802/jmd.09017", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027714", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4027714"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027714\">4027714</a>", "list_title": "PMC4027714  Usefulness of Diffusion-Weighted MRI for Differentiation between Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Parkinson Variant of Multiple System Atrophy"}

As a complex multifactorial disease, PD is caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins, genetic predisposition, mitochondrial dystrophies, epigenetic imbalance and environmental factors that increase the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the   substantia nigra   of the brain [  \u2013  ]. Traditional approaches of dopaminergic replacement, such as levodopa, carbidopa, and dopamine agonists (apomorphine, amantadine, cabergoline, pergolide, etc) restore direct or indirect dopaminergic supply, modulate dopaminergic neuron activity and stimulate postsynaptic receptors [ ,  ]. However, classical therapeutics are directed towards treating PD symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and systemic complications) in exchange for reducing disease progression coupled with a lack of long-term efficacy [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nEpidemiological studies demonstrated an inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD risk [  \u2013  ]. Pre-clinical studies using   in vivo   and   in vitro   models showed that nAChR agonists protect nigrostriatal and other neuronal cell populations against cytotoxic damage, suggesting a neuroprotective activity [  \u2013  ]. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels capable to respond to several ligands such as acetylcholine and nicotine [ ]. Classified between neuronal and muscle subtype receptors, only one pentameric subtype of nAChR (2  \u03b1  1,   \u03b2  1,   \u03b3  /  \u03b5  ,   \u03b4  ) has been reported for muscles compared with the 12 subtypes in the neural system (  \u03b1  2\u201310,   \u03b2  2\u20134). Neuroprotective activity of nicotine and nicotine agonists has been linked to the activation of \u03b17-nAChRs [ ,  ]. Highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons, \u03b17-nAChRs activation increases calcium flow and activates downstream SP such as ERK/MAPK, JAK2/STAT3, calmodulin and PI3K/AKT. SP activation has been related with neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and decreased apoptosis due to the overexpression of cell survival proteins such as Bcl-x, CREB and Bcl-2 [  \u2013  ]. In parallel, tumor suppressor p53 directly regulates cell survival by modulating Bax:Bcl-2 expression, influencing the apoptotic fate of a cell in response to stress [ ]. Bcl-2 has been suggested as a candidate for the nicotine-mediated neuroprotection activity in neurons. For example, nicotine induces the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 through either protein kinase C (PKC) and the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 or through PI3K-induced phosphorylation of AKT causing the inhibition of apoptosis in neuronal cultures [ ,  ,  ,   \u2013  ]. Additionally, overexpression of Bcl-2 Prevents neuronal death in   Mus musculus   models and Bcl-2 inhibition results in viability loss in dopaminergic cells through the induction of caspase-3 [ ,  ]. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \nIn this sense, nAChRs agonists can reduce secondary effects of classical therapies such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia, increased dopamine release and improve cytochrome P450 activity [ ,  ]. Nicotine usage as a pharmacological agent is limited considering toxicity and addiction [ ]. Nicotine analogs retaining neuroprotective activity, but reducing toxicity and addiction offer an excellent pharmacological alternative in PD [  \u2013  ]. We have previously the antioxidant potential of two nicotine analogs against rotenone-induced ROS generation in a PD   in vitro   model founding that 10 \u03bcM of (E)-Nicotinaldehyde O-Cinnamyloxime was able to reduce superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells treated with rotenone for 24h [ ]. Consistently, other studies showed that nicotine analogs decrease superoxide anion generation and oxidative stress in rodents   Mus musculus   and   Rattus rattus  , as well as primates   Macaca fascicularis   and   Saimiri sciureus   through the activation of \u03b17 nAChRs and PI3K/AKT [ ,   \u2013  ]. Computational methods have been used to infer the activity of candidate molecules but, due to the intrinsic PD complexity, is important to improve drug scanning efficiency by integrating structural and systemic data [  \u2013  ]. The development of holistic computational methodologies for SP and their modulatory mechanisms can lead to the discovery of new pharmacological agents [ ,  ]. In this aspect, the use of Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been previously used in a simplified model of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of cancer [ ]. Nevertheless, the absence of integrative modeling in PD has led to a decrease in drug discovery efficiency. In the present study, we predicted the effect of 8 novel nicotine analogs as possible neuroprotective agents acting on PI3K/AKT by integrating structural bioinformatic methods, SP manual reconstruction and ANN ( ). \n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Geometry and Structure Analysis \n  \nStructures of (3R,5S)-1, methyl-5-(piridine-3-yl) pirrolidine-3-ol (A1), 3-(1,3-dimethyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A2), 3-(3-methyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pira-zole-5-yl) piridine (A3), 3(((2S-4R)-1,4-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl)) (A4), 3-((2S,4R)-4-(fluoromethyl)-1-methylpirrolidine-2-il)piridine (A5), 3-((2S,4R)-4-methoxi-1-methylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A6), 3-((2S,3S)-1,3-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A7) and 5-methyl-3-(piridine-3-yl)-4,5-dihidroisoxazole (A8) were used for subsequent methods ( ). The neutral molecules optimized at the B3LYP/631G level and conformationally analyzed at the PM6 level showed rotations around C1-C1\u00b4bonds and bonds between radical atoms and rings. The minimum energy geometry found was used as input for subsequent analysis and the corresponding energy values (kJ/mol) for the local minimum geometrical conformers were reported in  . Geometrical rotations around the bonds of the rings and the radicals were categorized as true minima of the potential energy of the surface based on the absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies. \n\n\n### Nicotine Analogs Docking and \u03b17-nAChR Binding Interaction \n  \n\u03b17 nAChR has 5 active pockets located at each subunit interactions of the protein complex. Considering that the homopentamer has 5 identical active pockets, we modeled the interaction within one of the pockets considering all the 5 pockets in the homopentamer subunits interaction region are identical. AChBP ligand-binding structure possesses conserved domain residues forming a narrow hydrophobic pocket including A (Tyr91), B (Trp145), C (Tyr184 and Tyr191), D (Trp53), E (Leu106, Gln114 and Leu116). Whereby A, B, and C are present in a different AChBP ligand-binding subunit than D and E ( ). Following the structural analysis, the nicotine analogs were set to interact with the active pocket within the interaction of the \u03b17 nAChR homo-subunits. Nicotine structure resulted in a geometrical docked conformation in which the pyrrole ring is oriented towards the C loop favoring Van der Waals interactions with amino acids TYR91, TRP145, and TYR184 of the chain A, in addition to LEU106 and TRP53 of the chain B ( ). \n\nDocking models were performed with the top ligand conformations and the energy interaction values are presented in  . Evaluated nicotine analogs, except for A1 and A3, have minor binding energy compared with nicotine ( ). Energetically minimized protein structures interacting with nicotine and analogs were used to calculate Root-Mean-Square Deviation of atomic positions (RMSD) in a comparative manner against the unbonded receptor and \u03b17 nAChR docked with nicotine ( ). Such an unbonded model was set as the minimized structure of \u03b17 nAChR without ligand on the active side. \n\n\n### Clustering of Similarity \n  \nTwo manually curated groups of compounds with known \u03b17 nAChR agonistic and antagonistic activities were used as input for the cluster. The first group consisted of \u03b17 nAChR agonists SAK3 [ ], Nicotine, Acetylcholine, TC-1698 [ ], PNU-282987 [ ], DMXB [ ], and ABT-107 [ ]. The second group was composed of receptor \u03b17 antagonists and included methyllycaconitine [ ], mecamylamine [ ], neostigmine [ ], anisodamine [ ] and bupropion [ ]. To the best of our knowledge, these are all the compounds reported with agonistic neuroprotective activity and agonistic activity over \u03b17 nAChR. In this sense, we set a positive response of PI3K/AKT for the first group and we hypothesized a null activation of PI3K/AKT SP or repression by other molecular mechanisms, and therefore no neuroprotective activity [ ]. The same procedure previously mentioned was applied to obtain the optimized conformers for each group and all were categorized considering general descriptors of physicochemical properties [ ,  ]. Surprisingly, the dendrogram of similarity was found to be related to the variables and the neuroprotective activity but with inconclusive scores for similarity ( ). Nevertheless, cluster values of similarity for PaDEL-Descriptors structural, physical and chemical values were used to enrich the known experimental data of the ligands. \n\n\n### Signaling Pathway Reconstruction and Predictive Model of Interaction-Response \n  \nThe reconstructed model of PI3K/AKT SP presented both activation or inhibition of Bcl-2, as it occurs within the cell [ ]. The network is composed of 28 nodes (proteins) that represent relevant components of the pathway (\u03b17 nAChR, PI3K, AKT, CREB, etc), 2 final states (activation/inhibition) and 43 interactions between the nodes ( ). The network was constructed using nodes with biological relevance associated with PI3K/AKT and P53 proliferative regulatory activity. \n\nWith previously mentioned clustering and PaDEL-Descriptors data, 1848 variables were obtained characterizing physico-chemical and pharmacological properties for each one of the molecules, both agonist/antagonist and nicotine analogs. Reducing the number of variables for subsequent analysis, principal component analysis (PCA,  ) and K-mean decomposition ( ) were used maintaining data variance explanation. First PCA three dimensions explained 98.9% of variance across the original dataset ( ) while the K-mean showed a variance explanation of 57.1% for two-dimensions and the corresponding coordinate values ( ). \n\nBased on the PI3K/AKT architecture the resulting MCMC topology representing probabilities of transition within the network ( ). In this case, the resulting Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model was able to quantify the transitions between the directed network resulting in a model capable to determine the ANN architecture. The most effective number of hidden layers of the ANN was determined by iterative topology generation and convergence was reached at 100.000 iterations. Such an approach resulted in a multi-perceptron ANN with 4 hidden layers with 5, 1, 4 and 5 nodes respectively ( ). In general, the resulting topology lack a canonical hidden layer architectures considering these models tend to reduce the number of nodes per layer across the model [ ]. \n\nTraining datasets from the PCA and K-mean were evaluated for each of the ANN learning with 1000 iterations with randomized series and reported values of misclassification ( ). Backpropagation with weight tracking coupled with PCA model was capable of generating consistent results. In this sense, the consistency of resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking and PCA was 100% but resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking and K-mean showed 98%. These results suggest that both methods were able to predict the binomial output for the training and testing datasets. Nevertheless, throughout the iterations not all the predictions were identical in resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking and K-mean. \n\nThe resulting best ANN model implementing resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking is based on the evolving adaptation rule with a learning process based on error function [ ].\n \nand\n \n\nBriefly, for the adaptation rule each update-value   changes depending on the sign for each partial derivative of   \u00f9   at point   t  . If the values are too big then the algorithm skips a local minimum and the function decreases by  . Once   adapts,   changes according to   results  . Positive values of the derivative mean an error increase; therefore, the function is decreased by its  . Finally, the exception presented deals with changes in partial derivative sign   [ ]. In that case, the step was too large and missing the minimum, so the previous   is reverted. Finally, with the best trained structure method with PCA and Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking and the MCMC derived ANN multi-perceptron architecture it was possible to predict the neuroprotective potential of the nicotine analogs. This model predicted A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8 as potential neuroprotective agents. In this aspect, our model predicted that 7 out of 8 analogs had putative neuroprotective activity due to the association of the binomial output of the ANN with the activation of Bcl-2. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Conformer Geometry and Ligand-Receptor Interaction \n  \nEven though research efforts have been done regarding the pharmaceutical potential of nicotine analogs, little assessment of some critical aspects of their conformational variability has been studied [ ,  ]. Recently, the crystallographic structure of the extracellular domain of the nicotinic receptor \u03b17 in complex with epibatidine was reported [ ]. Although interactions described for the complex agree with our results, it was found that THR146, CYS187, and CYS186 could also be involved in the protein complex due to molecular proximity. Docking with analog A5 had a high-affinity score (\u22124.7) with respect to nicotine (\u22125.5) ( ). A5 affinity can be attributed to the geometrical conformation establishing hydrogen bonds and radicals orientation towards TRP145, similar to epibatidine. The high affinity of epibatidine has been related to large inter-nitrogen distance previously reported as 4.6 \u01fa [ ]. \n\nConsidering H-bond acceptors and donors number, analogs and nicotine had similar values. Specifically, A2, A3, A4 and A7 have two H-bond donors in comparison with three for A1, A5, A6 and A8. In terms of routable bonds, A5 and A6 differ from the single bond in nicotine considering the presence of radicals across the pyrrole ring ( ). Fluorine radical of A5 and the methyl group attached to the oxygen radical of A6 are rotation-capable bonds relative to the ring plane. Distinct similarity values in the clustering analysis for analogs A3 and A8 ( ) are not reflected in the values of energy affinity or interacting residues. Interestingly, A3 and A8 are the only analogs with a single methyl group addition to the pyrrolidine ring. In this sense, the group generated between A3 and A8 can be associated with the presence of the methyl group and the double bond with nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring. Nevertheless, clustering was capable of generating patterns based on atom pair descriptors and molecular fingerprints, the model is inefficient to replicate the docking data. All analogs clustered with nicotine and TC-1698 with a node value of 0.4 in the dendrogram, but A3 and A8 showed significant similarity with TC-1698, suggesting agonistic and neuroprotective activity. Interestingly, A3 and A8 also have a null net charge of interaction with the protein ( ). Nevertheless, further   in vitro   and   in vivo   experiments are necessary to assess the neuroprotective capacity of the tested molecules and   in silico   modeling must be performed to establish a correlation between structural signatures and biological activity. \n\nBesides affinity energy, the type and amount of interactions are crucial to determine the role of the docking in the protein function [ ]. In this case, nicotine interacts with TRP53, Tyr91, Leu116, Trp145, Tyr184, Cys186, Cys187 and Tyr191 through hydrophobic interactions and without hydrogen bonds ( ). Compared with nicotinic receptor \u03b17 in complex with epibatidine interaction, only residues Leu106 and Gln114 were absent in the interaction [ ]. Compared with the analogs, hydrophobic interactions with Leu106 were present in the analogs A1, A5, A6, and A8, but no hydrophobic interactions or hydrogen bonds were found with Gln114 ( ). The rest of the residues interacting with nicotine were found interacting at least once with any analog in similar geometrical orientations. Interestingly, none of the analogs presented the same interactions as nicotine, but the energy changes were not higher than 0.4 kJ/mol, except for A5 with 0.8 kJ/mol. Such values of A5 could be attributed to the highly electronegative fluorine radical interacting with Thr146. An increase in Affinity energy could be associated with the presence of hydroxyl radical in the polar sidechain. Moreover, fluorine has been associated with secondary effects in humans and, if consumed in higher doses, has been reported to be toxic, thus suggesting that A5 is not a suitable neuroprotective agent [ ,  ]. However, further studies must be performed in order to identify the role of specific residues in the activity of the complex and specific analog modifications effect over protein interactions. \n\nAdditionally, taking into account the comparison of RMSD values, after depuration of 25% of the misplaced atoms, unbonded protein and interacting complex with nicotine were lower than 0,1. Nicotine and analogs with the unbonded protein, RMSD validated our docking result ( ). RMSD for A2, A3 and A8 are higher than the rest of analogs when compared with the bounded complex with nicotine meaning that the geometrical modifications of the protein are higher. In this sense, A3 and A8 have the potential of interacting with the receptor similar to other neuroprotective compounds but changing the receptor response when compared with nicotine. The similar biological activity could be deduced also by considering the residues interacting, A3 and A8 as well as A6 and A7 present hydrogen bond interactions similar to nicotine ( ). With the structural and geometrical analysis is possible to conclude that all analogs except for A5 have neuroprotective potential and that A3 and A8 have an interesting behavior that must be addressed with   in vitro   and   in vivo   experiments. For A5, we present evidence of difference in energy affinity, interacting residues and fluoride radicals lead to the potential toxicity of A5. \n\nNevertheless, inconclusive relations between ligand structure, complex bonding and neuroprotective response occurred within the clustering. Even though consistent aggrupation occurred for all the neuroprotective compounds, antagonists generate a disperse distribution in the graph. The clustering FOF method was able to discriminate between biological effects but only strong aggrupation occurred only for neuroprotection positive molecules ( ). Acetylcholine was discarded considering divergence and ubiquitous neurotransmitter distribution coupled with no associated neuroprotective function [ ]. Worth noticing, the potential toxicity of the other analogs should be addressed by experimental methods considering no information is available in cell culture or animal models neither   in silico   testing \n\n\n### Neuroprotective Prediction Modeling \n  \nOnly a few studies have employed ANN in the study of signaling pathways [ ,  ]. For instance, a 3-layered multi-perceptron with backpropagation learning and sigmoid activation function was implemented across 96 genes to identify biomarkers in children sarcomas [ ]. Moreover, a simplified neural network comprising two microenvironmental input nodes (growth factor and death signal), and two phenotype output nodes (pro-growth and pro-death) was used to integrate environmental and molecular characteristics of cancer progression [ ]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines structural data, docking simulations, MCMC and ANN evaluating the modulation of PI3K/AKT allowing the prediction of neuroprotective new compounds. By including a higher set of variables, analogs cluster near to nicotine for both PCA and K-mean decomposition analysis (  &  ). Nevertheless, the absence of strong groups in the PCA and K-mean analysis showed that synthetic data was not conclusive to predict the biological activity by themselves. With this in mind, the ANN model was essential to discriminate between the groups and underline the fundamental properties of the analogs based on the SP structure, using both PCA and K-mean synthetic values \n\nSP are dynamic systems in which crosstalk with neighbor paths is essential to modulate signal intensity [ ]. P53 negative feedback increased the robustness of the model by modifying Bcl-2 binomial output and information flow across the model supporting network regulation ( ). Additionally, ionotropic channels, such as \u03b17-nAChR acting over PI3K/AKT lead to an activation without explicitly acknowledging the presence of JAK [ ]. MCMC PI3K/AKT-derived model considered a matrix of transition representing network structure and probabilities of transition across PI3K/AKT leading to robust computational inferences [ ]. By applying MCMC to the network topology it was possible to transfer the biological structure of the network to a quantitative model capable to modulate ANN architecture. The resulting non-canonical multi perceptron structure resulted as biological-based discrimination of ANN architectures through iterations using the MCMC matrix. Similar approaches such as the   drop-out   technique allow to drop units from the neural network during training hence preventing an excessive coadaptation and overfitting of the network [ ]. Iterative processes converged at the minimal topology with a significant predictive capacity of the ANN model reducing layer and nodes number [ ]. The hidden layers were locked according to the MCMC product ( ), ensuring that the subsequent topology represented the biological information contained in the SP. In this aspect, the synthetic iterative randomized data sets integrated with dimensional minimization and ANN, allowed the determination of the best predictive method reducing error and ensuring consistent predictions during training. \n\nPCA and K-mean dimensional reduction showed to be an effective way to effectively decrease sample variability to a low number of synthetic values [ ]. By reducing the number of variables from 1848 variables to a small non-autocorrelated dataset, PCA and K-mean reproduced clustering results. This approach was implemented in order to optimize the performance of the strategy and reduce overfitting of the trained ANN model. Through variable reduction, we increased the sensibility and reliability of the model to predict the binomial neuroprotective signal output. This data was used as training/testing for the ANN model evaluating some of the developed learning algorithms [ ]. Identical split differences in misclassification for smallest absolute derivative, backpropagation and smallest learning rate with PCA and K-mean, and resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with K-mean were identified ( ). Improvement was found for 25% misclassification for both resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA and resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking with K-mean. With this last method inconsistency in the predicting output was found meaning the output change through 2% of the iterations. Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA resulted as the best combination for neuroprotection prediction, considering 100% of the predictions were consistent along with the iterations. The resulting model was based on the implementation of an adaptation rule with a learning based on error values [ ]. By predicting the binomial neuroprotective output of the ANN with synthetic PCA data from structural conformational, docking analysis and physicochemical featuring, made possible to determine that A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8 have potential neuroprotective agents. In general, the results are consistent with the experimental data available for some of the compounds [ ,   \u2013  ]. \n\nEven though this model considers the main aspects of SP response to external stimuli, some key considerations are necessary. Structurally, the number of reference compounds used was low, making it necessary to improve \u03b17-nAChR agonist/antagonist data through identification and screening. Data restriction can lead to predicting bias of the model, overfitting or fixed prediction. In this matter, we recommend implementing both agonist and antagonist   in silico   and experimental screening to increase the training dataset. Although, the inclusion of synthetic molecules, such as SAK3, PNU-282987 and allosteric modulators allowed to improve predictions considering previously reported induction of neuroprotection through the modulation of PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 [ ]. Furthermore, the model can be used to address the secondary effects of nicotine analogs by increasing the dataset with addiction/reward molecules like nicotine and methyllycaconitine [ ]. \n\nCorrecting inner functions for noisy data needs to be coupled with further testing, essential to determine the true potential of nicotine analogs and antagonists for PD therapy. In this regard, we propose a mathematical   in silico   model that has to be used integrated with   in vitro   and   in vivo   data, either on dopaminergic neuronal cell lines, cerebral organoids or animal models. Database cluster enrichment with experimental data allows to increase the reference compounds and therefore reducing possible prediction bias and overfitting. Even so, the model strategy was in accordance with previously published experimental data [ ,   \u2013  ] proving to be robust enough as a testing method for further research. Worth noticing, SP are dynamic systems, therefore we suggest that continuous parameters need to be addressed to consider essential intermediate states [ ]. Finally, this strategy opens the door to improve neuroprotection prediction in the future by integrating protein dynamics, partial differential equations and other machine learning approaches. These type of approaches are necessary to improve drug scanning efficiency in PD and any other disease founded upon SP. \n\n\n### Conformational Analysis and Protein Structure Preparation \n  \n8 novel nicotine analogs ( ) were used in the present study: (3R,5S)-1, methyl-5-(piridine-3-yl) pirrolidine-3-ol (A1), 3-(1,3-dimethyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A2), 3-(3-methyl-4,5-dihidro-1h-pirazole-5-yl) piridine (A3), 3(((2S-4R)-1,4-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl)) (A4), 3-((2S,4R)-4-(fluoromethyl)-1-methylpirrolidine-2-il)piridine (A5), 3-((2S,4R)-4-methoxi-1-methylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A6), 3-((2S,3S)-1,3-dimethylpirrolidine-2-yl) piridine (A7) and 5-methyl-3-(piridine-3-yl)-4,5-dihidroisoxazole (A8). Molecular structures were sketched on Avogadro using MMFF94s forcefield, correcting atom type and chirality [ ]. Calculations were carried out with Gaussian 16 [ ], using B3LYP level of theory and cc-PVDZ basis set. In order to find the minimum energetic conformation, the structures were optimized at the DFT B3LYP/6\u201331G level. The conformational analysis was carried out on minimized rotating bonds between pyrrole, derivate rings, and pyridine rings, including the bonds of all the radicals of the pyrrole ring for each ligand. The maximum number of conformers for each molecule was set to 30, with the 10 lowest energy conformations used for the docking simulations. \n\nThe crystal structure of \u03b17-nAChR in complex with lobeline was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5AFJ) [ ]. AutoDockTools [ ] was used to assign polar hydrogens and add Gasteiger charges. The geometry of the receptor was optimized using the MM2 molecular mechanics force field. The neutral and ionized states of aliphatic amine and carboxylic acid groups of compounds to be docked were protonated and deprotonated separately. \n\n\n### Molecular Docking \n  \nTo determine the interaction between the studied molecules and the receptor, docking simulations were performed with AutoDock4 (version 4.2) [ ]. The active site of the pentameric structure of \u03b17-nAChR was defined as the interfaces between subunits that were within 12 \u00c5 from the geometric centroid of the ligand [ ]. Within the 3 domains of the protein (extracellular, intracellular and transmembrane), the pocket is located in the extracellular side of the receptor with residues from loops A-C of the principal subunit and loops D-E of the complementary subunit. Default settings for small molecule-protein docking were used throughout the simulations. \n\nDocked conformations were clustered according to the interacting energy combined with geometrical matching quality. The complexes with the best score were taken as the lead conformation for each compound. The correlation between key interactions obtained from the computational simulations and the interactions reported by the crystallographic structure of \u03b17-nAChR in complex with lobeline was further explored. To further analyze the differences between the interaction of the analogs and the receptor, we calculated the RMSD values between analogs, nicotine and the receptor. RMSD was calculated using 85% of the atoms resulted after 3 outlier rejection cycles. The energetically minimized docked structures of the \u03b17-nAChR receptor were made with Chimera [ ], using 10000 steepest descent steps, 0.001 \u01fa steepest descent steps size, 10 conjugate gradient steps, 0.001 \u01fa conjugate gradient steps size, update per 10 intervals, gasteiger method for charge and Amber ff14sb algorithms for residues. \n\n\n### Physicochemical Clustering and Dimensional Decomposition \n  \nTo determine the features for each molecule and their structural similarity, physicochemical property predictions, classification and clustering of structures were performed on ChemmineR, R package [ ]. Structural similarities between analogs were compared to a manually curated dataset of 7 agonists and 5 antagonists of \u03b17-nAChR with reported neuroprotective activity [  \u2013  ]. This method allowed us to increase the size of the available data, robustness and reproducibility. In the dataset, agonists of \u03b17-nAChR were associated with the induction of a neuroprotective pathway, either expressed through the induction of cell proliferation or apoptotic prevention. Antagonists were set to block either the proliferative activity by PI3K/AKT of the signaling pathway or the associated Ca  mobilization of the receptor [ ,  ,  ,  ]. \n\nClustering analysis was based on molecular descriptors, such as molecular formula, molecular weight, atom frequency and functional groups. To determine the optimal cluster, a matrix of molecular descriptors for all molecules was used, categorizing the ligands according to the structural, physical and chemical variables. To increase the robustness of the clustering model, additional physicochemical data from   de-novo   featurization was included [ ]. To ensure a proper physicochemical featurization and increase the number of variables available for further analysis, data from   de-novo   characterization using PaDEL-Descriptors [ ] was also included. Dimensionality reduction of the dataset was done by principal component analysis (PCA) and k-mean decomposition. The mentioned approaches were used to identify the multiparametric data capable to describe the agonistic and antagonistic function and the relation between the activity and structure of the ligands in the dataset. \n\n\n### Signal Reconstruction \n  \nTo establish a reliable topology of the SP related with the neuroprotective capacity of nicotine, a manually reconstructed network for the PI3K/AKT SP was developed using information from KEGG [  \u2013  ] and PantherDB [ ]. To ensure the biological coherence of the network, our model was enriched with additional protein-protein interactions that are present in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR interactive pathway [ ]. Finally, this PI3K/AKT SP was integrated with a manually curated model of p53 to generate a negative feedback over Bcl-2. In this aspect, the model included 6 specific proteins (Myc, Bim, P53, Bax, Noxa, Puma) associated with the partial inhibition of the Bcl-2, which emulates the SP biological behavior [ ]. \n\n\n### Activity Prediction and Interaction-Response Model \n  \nIn order to elucidate the quantitative relationship between \u03b17-nAChR receptor and the activation of Bcl-2, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model for the whole network was implemented. This model was based on the reconstructed PI3K/AKT SP network and was generated using the R package   MCMCpack   [ ]. A matrix of transitional stages predicting the most suitable path across the nodes was associated with the end stages of the MCMC that represented Bcl-2 expression as a binomial logical argument. The construction of the Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) was performed with the   NeuralNet   package in R [ ]. To determine the canonical architecture for the ANN we used an optimization algorithm using 100.000 iterations using the MCMC transition matrix as an input. A stable multi-perceptron structure was set to have a minimal number of hidden layers with the capacity of representing the MCMC transition matrix, as shown below: \n\nBriefly, a matrix   x   is used as input in the first layer of the multiperceptron. Each node of the hidden layer computes   f   to finally generate a binomial   y   output. \n\nThe dimensional reduction methods were used to train the ANN using the coordinates in the PCA and K-mean. One thousand randomized training datasets were selected and associated with the binomial activity of the ligand dataset. To optimize the predictive capability of the model using the training datasets, four ANN algorithms were compared: Backpropagation with a learning rate of 0.001, Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking, Resilient backpropagation without weight backtracking, smallest absolute derivative model and smallest learning rate. Additionally, for each possible combination of dimensional minimizations and ANN methods, the random data subsets used as training were iteratively generated, after excluding the testing values. To ensure the robustness of the prediction, values for misclassification error were obtained for each training and testing combination. In this aspect, the best model acquired was set to minimize the error to reduce the amount of false-positive predictions. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWe present a novel computational strategy as a novel quantitative approach used to predict the potential neuroprotective activity of 7 nicotine analogs in the context of PD therapeutics (A1, A2, A3, A4, A6, A7 and A8). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first machine learning neuroprotective computational strategy for ligand activity prediction over \u03b17-nAChR activating PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2. By conformational analysis, molecular docking, the use of PaDEL variables and geometrical optimization, we obtained robust evidence suggesting nicotine analogs activity compared with nicotine. \n\nThe model also showed the potential of ANN integrations with a dimensional reduction to avoid overfitting by autocorrelation. Resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking with PCA showed to be the best combination for ANN training to validate the neuroprotective activity. Nevertheless, additional data is needed to ensure model robustness, decrease the error of misclassification and avoid fixing predictions. Nicotine analogs have promissory future as candidates for PD treatment if future improvements to these strategies are performed. Nevertheless, further studies must be performed to identify the potential of nicotine analogs as neuroprotective compounds and the application of these methods in neurodegenerative research. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8081347, "text_md5": "156bf452ddaa3db9a674c113b446c1fe", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 158], "journal": [159, 176], "publication_year": [178, 182], "title": [193, 297], "keywords": [311, 418], "abstract": [431, 2819], "body": [2828, 38747]}, "batch": 1, "pmid": 33927788, "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081347", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8081347"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081347\">8081347</a>", "list_title": "PMC8081347  Machine Learning Neuroprotective Strategy Reveals a Unique Set of Parkinson Therapeutic Nicotine Analogs"}

Under the assumption that diffusion within a voxel can be well described by a collection of diffusion tensors, several parameters of this diffusion tensor distribution can be derived, including mean size, variance of sizes, orientational dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy. The information provided by multidimensional diffusion encoding also enables us to decompose the sources of the conventional fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis. In this study, we explored the utility of the diffusion tensor distribution approach for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and in Parkinson disease by using double diffusion encoding. Data from 23 healthy older subjects and 27 patients with Parkinson disease were analyzed. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variances, as well as smaller microscopic anisotropy. By analyzing the parameters underlying diffusion kurtosis, we found that the reductions of kurtosis in aging and Parkinson disease reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction in microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in the patients with Parkinson disease. The present results support the use of multidimensional diffusion encoding in clinical studies and are encouraging for its future clinical implementation. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nParkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms (akinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity) and a wide range of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and autonomic dysfunctions ( ). Advanced age is a major risk factor for the development of PD and is also associated with faster motor decline ( ;  ). Pathologically, PD is characterized by widespread aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions in the form of Lewy pathology within both the neuronal cytoplasm (Lewy bodies) and axons (Lewy neurites) ( ;  ;  ). Neuropathological studies have indicated that Lewy pathologies evolve along major fiber pathways, beginning in the brain stem and eventually advancing to the neocortical regions ( ). Accumulating evidence has suggested that axonal degeneration is an early event in the process of neurodegeneration that is common to PD and other age-related neurological diseases ( ;  ). Non-invasive characterization of the neurodegeneration underlying the pathogenesis and progression of PD is of high clinical demand, because it will aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies and in monitoring the effects of treatment. \n\nDiffusion MRI (dMRI) is uniquely sensitive to tissue features on the micrometer scale and therefore has been widely used to study neurodegeneration in aging ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and diseases ( ;  ). In PD, the majority of studies have applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ( ) and have consistently reported smaller fractional anisotropy (FA) and greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the white matter of patients than of controls (for a recent review and meta-analysis see  ). Several groups ( ;  ,  ;  ,  ) further explored the utility of dMRI acquisition with higher b-values than used in DTI, which is typically analyzed by means of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) ( ). The works by  ,   showed that kurtosis in the white matter is reduced in patients and that DKI is more sensitive to white-matter degeneration than is DTI. Of note, several studies demonstrated that white-matter degeneration as detected by dMRI precedes macroscopic gray matter atrophy ( ;  ;  ), suggesting the potential of dMRI parameters as early biomarkers of PD. \n\nRegarding acquisition, both DTI and DKI use single diffusion encoding (SDE), which uses one pair of diffusion-sensitizing gradients. Multidimensional diffusion encoding ( ;  ), that can be realized by using either double diffusion encoding (DDE) ( ;  ), triple diffusion encoding ( ), or continuous gradient waveforms ( ;  ;  ), has recently gained attention in clinical studies because these methods provide more specific information about the tissue microstructure. For example, cumulant expansion of the DDE signal up to the fourth-order term of the gradient amplitude ( ) shows DDE provides unique information that is not contained in the standard diffusion and kurtosis tensors available with SDE. In addition to DTI/DKI parameters, at least two new properties of biological interest can be obtained: the microscopic anisotropy ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and the variance of isotropic diffusivities among individual microenvironments (compartments) ( ;  ). Several works have demonstrated that the microscopic anisotropy, a measure of diffusion anisotropy that is not confounded by orientational dispersion of axons or fibers, can be estimated reliably in nervous tissues ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Microscopic anisotropy has been shown to be useful for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging ( ) and in multiple sclerosis ( ;  ). The variance of isotropic diffusivities has also been suggested to be promising for deducing the microstructural underpinnings of the diffusion changes in diseases like schizophrenia ( ). Moreover, multidimensional diffusion encoding enables us to decompose the sources of DTI/DKI parameters ( ;  ;  ;  ). Such analyses are expected to improve our understanding of neurodegeneration and the sensitivity of imaging to pathology. For example, if the pathology affects two underlying sources of a particular DTI/DKI parameter in opposite directions, as has been suggested in  ;  ,  , the sensitivity and interpretability of that parameter would be limited, whereas separation of each source may provide useful information. \n\nIn this study, we analyzed DDE data by using the covariance tensor framework ( ) that works under the diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) model ( ). Given the DTD model, continuous waveforms would offer more efficient diffusion weighting and faster acquisition than DDE ( ). We adopted DDE here because this study was planned before the definition of diffusion time for the continuous waveform was made by  . As DTD is a model for the long diffusion time limit where time-dependence is negligible ( ), we needed to compare the diffusion time of our measurement with the previous studies ( ;  ) to rationalize our assumption. The potential limitation arising from neglecting the effects of diffusion time is detailed in \u201cDiscussion.\u201d \n\nThe aim of this study was to identify the sources of DTI/DKI changes previously reported in aging and PD in terms of the DTD model parameters. We first analyzed correlation with age in healthy older subjects and then examined group differences between the healthy subjects and patients with PD. Finally, we investigated the correlations with the severity of motor impairment in the patients. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Theory \n  \n#### Model and Assumptions \n  \nLinking the MRI signal to specific tissue properties involves modeling, simplification of the complex reality relying on a few assumptions. By adopting the DTD model, we assume that the voxel consists of multiple, non-exchanging Gaussian compartments. More precisely, we model the diffusion within a voxel by a distribution of diffusion tensors (free, anisotropic diffusion) ( ;  ). In such case, the measurement can be fully characterized by the b-tensor (i.e., b-tensor encoding). In this regard, SDE is linear tensor encoding (LTE), whereas DDE provides planar tensor encoding (PTE) if we apply two diffusion encodings in non-colinear directions ( ;  ). Although the DTD model is certainly a crude assumption and not fully validated yet in human brain, describing the tissue by a combination of several diffusion tensors is a common starting point in most dMRI models currently used in clinical studies ( ). \n\nUnder the DTD model, the signal can be written as: \n\nwhere   S  (  B  ) is the signal,   S   is the signal without diffusion weighting,   B   is the b-tensor, and   D   is the diffusion tensor of each compartment. The bracket < > denotes the ensemble average over the voxel. The colon denotes a generalized scalar product between the two tensors,   B  :  D   = \u2211 \u2211  B   D  . \n\n\n#### Diffusion Parameters \n  \nMultidimensional diffusion encoding provides us means to extract summarizing statistics of the distribution of diffusion tensors. Eq. 1 can be expanded ( ;  ) to: \n\nwhere \u2297 denotes a tensor outer product. Here,   D   is the well-known, voxel-averaged diffusion tensor, and   C   is a fourth-order tensor called the covariance tensor. From   D   and   C  , several scalar parameters that summarize microstructural features, including DTI/DKI parameters, can be computed ( ;  ;  ). Below, we briefly describe the meanings of the parameters used in this study and their relations to each other. First, the DTI parameters MD and FA are defined ( ;  ;  ) as: \n\n V  (  D  ) denote the variance of eigenvalues of   D  , defined by using the eigenvalues \u03bb , \u03bb , and \u03bb  as  . MD and FA can be understood as the size and shape of the voxel-averaged diffusion tensor. The definition of \u03bcFA has a similar form to that of FA ( ;  ): \n\nUnlike FA, \u03bcFA is not influenced by orientational dispersion and purely reflects the anisotropy (shape) of microstructural environments. In addition, a measure of orientational dispersion (the orientational order parameter, OP) is defined ( ;  ) as: \n\nOP equals 1 for perfectly aligned orientations and equals 0 for fully isotropic dispersion. FA is influenced by both \u03bcFA and OP ( ): \n\nFurthermore, under the DTD assumption, mean kurtosis (MK), as defined in  , can be decomposed into two kurtosis sources ( ;  ): \n\nwhere \n\nare the isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis sources. Here,   V  (  D  ) is the variance of isotropic diffusivities among compartments (variance of sizes). The last term in Eq. 8 is a factor related to orientational dispersion and can be expressed as ( ;  ) \n\nUsing Eq. 11, Eq. 8 can be re-written as: \n\nIn this study, we report MD, FA, MK,   K  ,   K  , \u03bcFA, OP, and   V  (  D  ). Although the information represented by some parameters overlaps (e.g., both \u03bcFA and   K   are measures of microscopic anisotropy), having multiple forms of expression helps us to understand how the DTD parameters affect FA and MK (Eqs 7 and 12). \n\n\n\n### Participants \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for experiments involving humans. The Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. Twenty-three healthy older subjects (63.1 \u00b1 7.2 years old) and 27 patients with PD (66.1 \u00b1 6.6 years old) were enrolled. Patients with PD were diagnosed by neurologists on the basis of clinical diagnostic criteria of the Movement Disorder Society ( ). Motor function and disease stage were evaluated with the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III) ( ) and the Hoehn and Yahr staging scale ( ). White-matter T2 hyperintensities (WMH) were rated according to the Fazekas scale ( ). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants are summarized in  . \n  \nDemographic features of the study participants. \n    \nBecause DDE is a relatively new technique for clinical research, we also examined the stability of the dMRI parameters in terms of scan\u2013rescan repeatability in a separate group of 4 young healthy subjects (3 male and 1 female, 25\u201337 years old), who underwent two scans on different days within a week. In these subjects, we also acquired conventional SDE for comparison. \n\n\n### Image Acquisition \n  \nThe subjects were scanned by using a clinical 3T scanner (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-channel head coil using a prototype sequence. DDE data were acquired using a monopolar spin-echo type acquisition. We used parallel (LTE) and perpendicular (PTE) pairs of diffusion sensitizing gradient blocks, with 30 uniformly distributed directions. Note that, under the DTD assumption, the direction of PTE can be characterized by the normal vector. For both LTE and PTE, we used two shells, which had b-values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm . One volume without diffusion weighting was also obtained. Thus, a total of 121 volumes were acquired. Other settings were image resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm , TE = 93 ms, TR = 6300 ms, \u0394 = 18.3 ms, \u03b4 = 16.8 ms, mixing time = 24.9 ms, in-plane GRAPPA with acceleration factor 2, through-plane GRAPPA (SMS) with multiband factor 2, partial Fourier 6/8, 44 axial slices, and scan time 14 min. In addition, anatomical T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired and inspected by a neuroradiologist to rate Fazekas grade and to check for any other co-existing pathologies. SDE acquisition in the young subjects used the same b-values and 30 directions, resulting in a total of 61 volumes. The acquisition settings were identical to those of DDE, except \u0394 = 43.3 ms and \u03b4 = 36.4 ms. The scan time for SDE was 7 min. \n\n\n### Image Processing \n  \nImages were pre-processed by using FSL 6.0.1 ( ) and MRTrix3 ( ). Raw images were denoised ( ) and corrected for Gibbs artifact ( ), eddy currents and motion ( ), and B1 inhomogeneity ( ). For eddy-current correction of DDE, the second diffusion direction was used as the input to   eddy   in FSL ( ). The dMRI parameter maps were computed using the multidimensional diffusion MRI toolbox ( ). In a small number of voxels where the fitting resulted in negative values of   V  (  D  ), the fitting was repeated by using data smoothed with an isotropic 3D Gaussian kernel with sigma = 0.7 \u00d7 voxel size. \n\n\n### Stability of Measurements \n  \nUsing the scan-rescan data from the 4 young subjects, we computed the within-subject coefficient of variation (CV ), defined as  . Here, \u03bc is the grand mean and \u03c3  is the within-subject standard deviation. To compute CV  across the white-matter voxels, each subject\u2019s FA map was non-linearly registered into the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) template in FSL. The other dMRI parameter maps were also transferred into the standard space by using the same deformation. A white-matter mask was generated by thresholding the FA template at FA > 0.2. To mitigate partial volume effects with the gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the mask was further eroded by one voxel. We also report CV  for the mean value of each white-matter region of interest (ROI) that was used for the analyses of aging and PD (Section \u201cStatistical Analysis\u201d). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe examined the effects of the subjects\u2019 characteristics (age, diagnosis, and UPDRS-III score) on the dMRI parameters by means of whole-brain voxel-wise analyses using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) ( ) and atlas-based ROI analyses. First, all subjects\u2019 FA images were aligned into a common space by means of non-linear registration, followed by creation of a mean FA skeleton. The threshold for creating the FA skeleton was set at FA > 0.2. Then, the aligned FA map of each subject was projected onto the FA skeleton. The other parameter maps were projected onto the mean FA skeleton by using the same transformation. Subsequently, the TBSS-processed skeletons were subjected to ROI analyses. Twelve white-matter ROIs were defined as the intersection of the white-matter skeleton and the JHU and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases in FSL as in   ( ), and the mean value within each ROI was extracted. Specifically, the deep white-matter ROIs (the anterior corona radiata [ACR], posterior corona radiata [PCR], superior corona radiata [SCR], anterior and posterior limb of the internal capsule [ALIC, PLIC], and genu and splenium of the corpus callosum [GCC, SCC]) were defined by using the JHU atlas, and the subcortical white-matter ROIs (frontal, sensory-motor, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices) were defined by using the Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas. \n  \nAtlas-based ROIs. Twelve ROIs were defined as the intersections between the TBSS-processed white-matter skeleton and the JHU and Harvard\u2013Oxford atlases in FSL (ACR/SCR/PCR, anterior/superior/posterior corona radiata; ALIC/PLIC, anterior/posterior limb of the internal capsule; GCC/SCC, genu/splenium of the corpus callosum). \n  \nWe opted not to exclude voxels with WMH from the analyses for the following two reasons. First, evidence suggests associations between WMH and the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD ( ;  ). The pathophysiology of WMH is complex, and whether WMH are present in the patients because of incidental cerebrovascular disease or are a consequence of PD remains unclear ( ). Second, although TBSS allows the exclusion of voxels by using subject-specific lesion masks, this process causes differences in the degrees of freedom across voxels and may complicate the interpretation of statistical results ( ). \n\nFor both the TBSS and ROI-based analyses, we fit linear models where the dependent variable was each dMRI parameter. First, we examined the effect of age in the healthy subjects, using sex as a nuisance covariate. Then, we examined the differences between the healthy subjects and the patients with PD, using age and sex as nuisance covariates. Finally, we examined the correlation with UPDRS-III score in the patients, using age and sex as nuisance covariates. Because motor impairment might be correlated with age, we checked for multi-collinearity using the variance inflating factor (VIF) ( ). Although we used a stringent criterion of VIF < 4.0 ( ), VIF was below this threshold for all predictors in the linear models. Statistical inference of the linear models was conducted by using permutation analysis ( ). For computational efficiency, we used 2000 permutation and tail approximations ( ). For TBSS, threshold-free cluster enhancement ( ) was applied. The significance threshold was set at   P   < 0.05, corrected for family-wise error (FWE) for multiple comparisons across voxels or ROIs. For the ROI-based analyses, we also report results without FWE correction (  P   < 0.05) because these data may be informative for future studies with larger samples. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Scan-Rescan Repeatability \n  \nMD, FA, and MK showed excellent repeatability, with CV  below 6\u20138% for most of the white-matter voxels ( ). The values of CV  were similar between DDE and SDE. \u03bcFA and OP also showed CV  below 8% for most of the voxels. The parameters of size variance [  K   and   V  (  D  )] showed greater CV , falling in the range of 10\u201325% for most of the voxels. As for ROI-based measurements, CV  was below 2% in all ROIs for MD, FA, \u03bcFA, and OP ( ). MK and   K   exhibited slightly greater values of CV  ranging from 0.5 to 4.8%. Although   K   and   V  (  D  ) showed CV  below 6% for most of the ROIs, poorer repeatability was found in the internal capsule and corpus callosum with CV  around 10%, reflecting the challenges of dMRI in these regions due to partial volume effects with the CSF and the gray matter, Gibbs artifact, and CSF pulsation. \n  \nScan\u2013rescan repeatability of the dMRI parameters derived from DDE.

The blue and orange histograms represent CV  of the dMRI parameters derived from DDE and SDE, respectively. \n    \nWithin-subject coefficients of variation of the ROI means (values are percentages). \n    \n\n### Correlation With Age in the Healthy Subjects \n  \nTo display the results of ROI-based correlations, we adopted a figure format used in   and   ( ). For MD and   V  (  D  ), positive correlation with age was seen in extensive regions of the white matter in both ROI-based analyses and TBSS ( \u2013 ). FA, MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA showed negative correlation with age within these regions. OP demonstrated a unique behavior in that both positive and negative correlations were observed, depending on anatomical locations. In particular, although the correlation was negative in most of the white-matter regions, positive correlation was observed in the ALIC and PLIC, external capsule, and SCR.   K   showed positive correlation with age, although in fewer regions compared with the other diffusion parameters. \n  \nCorrelation with age in the healthy control subjects. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients are shown where a correlation between a diffusion parameter and age was found (  P   < 0.05). Red denotes positive correlation; blue indicates negative correlation. Asterisks indicate significant correlations after FWE correction.

Voxels with significant correlation after the FWE correction (  P   < 0.05) are shown. Hot colors denote positive correlation, whereas cold colors denote negative correlation. To aid visualization, the results were thickened by using the   fill   function in FSL. \n  \n\n### Difference Between the Healthy Control and the Patients With PD \n  \nThe ROI-based analyses revealed that the patients with PD had greater values of MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) in the subcortical white-matter regions than the controls ( ), although only the differences in   K   and   V  (  D  ) of the parietal ROI remained significant after the FWE correction. The group differences were below the significance threshold for   K   and \u03bcFA for all ROIs. Slightly greater values of MK were observed in the patients in the PLIC and SCC. Smaller values of FA and OP were observed in the ALIC and PLIC, respectively. In TBSS, only OP revealed statistically significant results: the patients exhibited smaller values in the left internal capsule, the left cerebral peduncle, the left thalamus, and the right external capsule ( ). \n  \nDifferences between the healthy control subjects (light blue) and the patients with PD (dark blue) in the ROI-based analyses.

Advanced age was associated with greater MD and smaller FA, MK,   K  , and \u03bcFA, in agreement with previous studies that used SDE ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ) and DDE ( ). OP decreased with age for most of the voxels, which, together with the decrease of \u03bcFA, led to the age-related decrease of FA. At the same time, a positive correlation between OP and age was observed in some white matter regions including the ALIC, PLIC, and SCR. Our results of age-related changes in \u03bcFA and OP replicated the findings by the earlier study ( ). Age-related OP increase in some regions can be understood as selective degeneration of the secondary crossing fibers, thus increasing the proportion of aligned fibers. The work by   employed a different approach than the DTD model, i.e., microscopic anisotropy estimation proposed in   which is based on the signal equation of restricted diffusion provided by  . Though it is beyond the scope of this study to examine which model should be preferred, it seems that the observed trends in age-related changes of \u03bcFA and OP are robust against this difference in model assumptions. We also found an age-related increase in the measures of size variance [  K   and   V  (  D  )]. The effects of aging and PD were in the same directions for most of the diffusion parameters and anatomical locations, such as increases of MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) and decreases of FA,   K  , and \u03bcFA. This is biologically plausible, because neurodegeneration in aging and PD have many features in common, including a declined ability to homeostatically regulate proteostasis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, degeneration of the myelin sheath, accumulation of cellular debris, alteration of axonal transport, axonal swelling/beading, and loss of axons ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The present results also suggest that the measures of microscopic anisotropy (  K   and \u03bcFA) might be useful to track white-matter degeneration related to the motor impairment in PD. \n\nThrough the analysis of underlying kurtosis sources via the DTD model, we found that the reductions of MK reported in aging ( ;  ;  ) and PD ( ,  ) are likely driven by the reduction of microscopic anisotropy. The decomposition of kurtosis sources (Eq. 12) suggests that either an increase of   K   or a decrease of OP would lead to an increase of MK. We indeed observed slightly greater MK in the PLIC and SCC in the patients than in the controls. Although this appears to contradict previous reports of smaller MK in patients ( ,  ), it may instead indicate that the increase of   K   and decrease of   K   have different time trajectories during disease progression. If the increase of   K   is related to early neuroinflammation and the decrease of   K   represents the subsequent degeneration, as speculated by  , MK may possibly have a non-monotonical trajectory, with an initial increase followed by decrease, assuming constant OP (Eq. 12). Future studies to investigate the trajectories of the DTD parameters in relation to disease progression are warranted. We also demonstrated that microscopic anisotropy can be estimated with excellent repeatability comparable to that of SDE-derived DTI/DKI parameters in both the present study and the literature ( ;  ). Taken together, the present results are encouraging that multidimensional diffusion encoding could be implemented clinically. Although we used a relatively long acquisition for this exploratory study, \u03bcFA can be estimated reliably with a reduced DDE acquisition ( ;  ) to make the scan time clinically feasible. \n\nOur results support several hypothetical interpretations of previous SDE studies that relied on more restrictive assumptions. ( ) and ( ) applied regularized fitting of the bi-tensor free-water DTI model ( ) to study aging and PD, respectively. Their results showed that aging and PD are associated with an increase of the free-water fraction in the white matter. A larger free-water fraction would lead to greater size variance and smaller microscopic anisotropy ( ;  ), as observed in our study. Certainly, an increase in free water is not the only possible mechanism, and further investigation is required to elucidate specific pathological features. For example, patchy axonal loss and demyelination may lead to similar results via heterogenous increase of the radial diffusivities of compartmental diffusion tensors. Changes in axon morphology such as swelling and beading, which would reduce axial diffusivities of compartmental diffusion tensors ( ;  ) and hence \u03bcFA, also occur heterogeneously within a voxel and may lead to an increase of size variance. ( ) estimated \u03bcFA by using SDE under the assumption of uniform size and shape of compartmental diffusion tensors ( ) and reported a reduction of \u03bcFA in patients with PD and correlation with UPDRS-III score, in line with our observations. Although the methods of   and   were designed to be practical for use with clinical SDE data, the dependence on regularization or strongly restrictive assumptions may bias the output parameters ( ;  ) and therefore confirmation with extended acquisition, as we used in the current study, is important. \n\nAlthough the differences between the controls and the patients were less prominent than the effects of age, smaller OP in the patients was identified in the left cerebral peduncle and left internal capsule ( ). This overlaps the anatomical location of the medial forebrain bundle ( ), a fiber bundle that is involved early in PD ( ). Our results are in line with those of previous studies that observed reduced FA within this region ( ;  ), as well as with reports of left-predominant involvement ( ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, we observed   K   and \u03bcFA were not very sensitive to the group differences between the normal subjects and the patients with PD ( ), despite their correlation with the motor impairment. In contrast, MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) showed some sensitivity to the group differences in several ROIs but their correlation with motor impairment was limited to the callosal ROIs ( ). Although the mechanisms behind these observations remain unknown, our speculation is that these two groups of diffusion parameters weigh different facets of neurodegeneration. It has been hypothesized that age-related changes form pathological foundation on which PD-related neurodegeneration build ( ), and that there is a biological interaction between aging and PD ( ). We speculate that microscopic anisotropy has relatively greater weight on the accumulation of age-related neuronal damage that is perhaps accelerated in PD and exacerbates the clinical expression of symptoms, while reduced microscopic anisotropy is less specific to the diagnosis of PD. On the other hand, MD,   K  , and   V  (  D  ) may be influenced more by the factors that differentiate PD from normal aging but are not proportional to disease progression. \n\nSeveral possible confounding effects with regard to acquisition and parameter estimation need to be mentioned. First, by adopting the DTD model, which does not feature the effects of timing parameters (diffusion gradient duration, separation between the gradients, and the mixing time), we assumed the effects of timing parameters were negligible. Though this has some support by earlier studies observing the effects of diffusion time were small in brain tissue for the range above 10 ms ( ;  ), more recent studies suggest observable time-dependence in the human white matter for even longer times ( ;  ). A recent observation of intra-compartmental kurtosis in mouse brains ( ) also indicate the contribution of restricted compartments might be non-negligible. Taken together, the DTD model employed in this study may not fully capture the microstructural complexities and a more adequate model would need to feature the effects that explain the reported time-dependence, like restricted compartments ( ;  ), structural disorder ( ), or inter-compartmental exchange ( ). Incorporating the timing parameters as additional measurement dimensions of DDE is expected to identify a suitable extension of the model in future. Though dependence on the DTD model is an essential limitation to our study, in  , \u03bcFA estimated under this assumption approximated the gold-standard model-free method ( ) very well in human white matter. Therefore, we believe that any bias introduced by the model assumption was not large, at least for \u03bcFA and   K  . Second, the expansion Eq. 2 is valid only in the vicinity of   b   = 0 ( ;  ), as in the case of DTI/DKI ( ). Although the covariance tensor framework is computationally efficient, a possible bias in case of finite signal-to-noise ratio has been pointed out ( ). In addition, our scan\u2013rescan analyses revealed problematic instability of the   V  (  D  ) and   K   estimation, which needs to be addressed before clinical application of these metrics. Third, the acquisition used in this study was not controlled for the concomitant fields (transverse magnetic field components accompanying the applied gradient to satisfy Maxwell\u2019s equations) ( ), which cause bias in the signal and hence the DTD parameters ( ). This issue would be mitigated by the use of multiple refocusing pulses to make the diffusion encoding symmetric ( ). \n\nOur study has several limitations. First, PD is a heterogenous disease whose clinical manifestations vary widely among individual patients ( ). Robust determination of PD subtypes based on cross-sectional data remains a challenge ( ) and needs to be addressed in future work. Also, though we merged the left and right ROIs for this exploratory study, neurodegeneration in PD has some asymmetry which correlates with the laterality of symptoms ( ). Further investigation with a large sample will be necessary to elucidate the relationships between white-matter degeneration and detailed clinical features, including both motor and non-motor symptoms. Second, we did not prove clinical benefit of DDE as compared to the standard SDE. Though \u03bcFA showed better correlation with age and motor impairment than FA, similar correlation could be observed with MK. Given the longer scan time of DDE, DTI/DKI based on standard SDE is still a powerful option for clinical studies. However, the strength of this study is that we showed the sensitivity of MK to neurodegeneration is likely attributed to its link to microscopic anisotropy. Such knowledge can be informative for future researches in selecting dMRI acquisition and parameter to study particular diseases. Third, we applied simplistic linear models for statistical analyses, but the effects of age might differ between the patients and the controls ( ;  ). Also, the effect of PD might differ between males and females ( ). Although adding age \u00d7 disease and sex \u00d7 disease interactions in the linear model did not reveal any significant interactions for the present data (not shown), several imaging studies have suggested that these interactions are non-negligible ( ;  ). The absence of these interaction effects in the present study may be attributed to the relatively small sample size which was not optimally matched regarding male/female ratio. Fourth, the majority of patients had relatively long disease duration and were already under medication, and therefore we could not quantify the effects of medication ( ) and/or the non-linear (U-shaped) trajectories presumably related to neuronal compensation ( ). Lastly, the scan\u2013rescan repeatability should ideally be measured in a cohort similar to the patients because motion artifacts might be severer in these subjects than in young and healthy subjects. Also, the within-subject variability needs to be evaluated relative to the between-subject variability in the patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this study, we explored the utility of DDE-derived parameters for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and PD. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variance of the compartmental diffusion tensors and with smaller microscopic anisotropy. We found the reductions of MK in aging and PD reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction of microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in PD. We further showed that microscopic anisotropy can be estimated with excellent repeatability by using modern clinical scanners. In conclusion, multidimensional diffusion encoding can provide more comprehensive and clinically relevant information about the white-matter degeneration in aging and PD than conventional SDE-based methods. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Juntendo University School Hospital.
